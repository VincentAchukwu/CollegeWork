<h4>Scene I. Windsor. Before Page&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Shallow, Slender, and
Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a
Star-chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace
and
&#8216;Coram.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, cousin Slender, and &#8216;Custalourum&#8217;.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and &#8216;Rato-lorum&#8217; too; and a
gentleman born,
master parson; who writes himself &#8216;Armigero,&#8217; in
any
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation,
&#8216;Armigero.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that I do; and have done any time these
three
hundred years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">All his successors gone before him hath
done&#8217;t; and
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">It is an old coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">The dozen white louses do become an old coat
well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
man, and signifies love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an
old coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I may quarter, coz.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">You may, by marrying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, py&#8217;r lady; if he has a quarter of your
coat,
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
between you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The council shall bear it; it is a riot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is
no
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
riot; take your vizaments in that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! o&#8217; my life, if I were young again, the
sword
should end it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is petter that friends is the sword, and end
it:
and there is also another device in my prain, which
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
Page, which is pretty virginity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and
speaks
small like a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is that fery person for all the orld, as just
as
you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
death&#8217;s-bed&#8212;Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
&#8212;give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred
pound?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and her father is make her a petter
penny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I know the young gentlewoman; she has good
gifts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot
gifts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I
do
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Knocks</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, hoa! Got pless your house here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Who&#8217;s
there?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Here is Got&#8217;s plessing, and your friend,
and Justice
Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
matters grow to your likings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to see your worships well.<br>
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do
it
your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?&#8212;and I
thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I thank you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say
he
was outrun on Cotsall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">It could not be judged, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll not confess, you&#8217;ll not
confess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">That he will not. &#8217;Tis your fault,
&#8217;tis your fault;<br>
&#8217;tis a good dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">A cur, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he&#8217;s a good dog, and a fair dog: can
there be
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
Falstaff here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a
good
office between you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">He hath wronged me, Master Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">If it be confessed, it is not redress&#8217;d: is
not that
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Sir John.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Master Shallow, you&#8217;ll complain of me
to the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer,
and
broke open my lodge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">But not kissed your keeper&#8217;s daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I will answer it straight; I have done all
this.<br>
That is now answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The council shall know this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere better for you if it were known in
counsel:
you&#8217;ll be laughed at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke
your
head: what matter have you against me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against
you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">You Banbury cheese!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, it is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Mephostophilus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, it is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that&#8217;s
my humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Simple, my man? Can you tell,
cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There
is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">We three, to hear it and end it between them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my
note-book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
as great discreetly as we can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Pistol!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">He hears with ears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this,
&#8216;He
hears with ear&#8217;? why, it is affectations.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Pistol, did you pick Master Slender&#8217;s
purse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I
might
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Is this true, Pistol?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master
mine,<br>
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.<br>
Word of denial in thy labras here!<br>
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">By these gloves, then, &#8217;twas he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will
say
&#8217;marry trap&#8217; with you, if you run the
nuthook&#8217;s
humour on me; that is the very note of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">By this hat, then, he in the red face had it;
for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, Scarlet and John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had
drunk
himself out of his five sentences.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance
is!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered;
and
so conclusions passed the careires.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but &#8217;tis
no
matter: I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be drunk whilst I live again,
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
if I be drunk, I&#8217;ll be drunk with those that have
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you
hear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Anne Page, with wine;
Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we&#8217;ll
drink within.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Anne Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Mistress Ford!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well
met:
by your leave, good mistress.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kisses her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have
a
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
we shall drink down all unkindness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except Shallow,
Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book
of<br>
Songs and Sonnets here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Simple</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Simple! where have you been? I must
wait
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
about you, have you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to
Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
with
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as &#8217;twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
here. Do you understand me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be
so,<br>
I shall do that that is reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but understand me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">So I do, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I
will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I
pray
you, pardon me; he&#8217;s a justice of peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there&#8217;s the point, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress
Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">But can you affection the &#8217;oman? Let us
command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one
that
would do reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, Got&#8217;s lords and his ladies! you must
speak
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I will do a greater thing than that, upon
your
request, cousin, in any reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I
do
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if
there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
married and have more occasion to know one another;
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
but if you say, &#8216;Marry her,&#8217; I will marry her; that
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is
in
the ort &#8216;dissolutely:&#8217; the ort is, according to our
meaning, &#8216;resolutely:&#8217; his meaning is good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes fair Mistress Anne.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Anne Page</span></p>
<p class="speech">Would I were young for your sake, Mistress
Anne!</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">The dinner is on the table; my father desires
your
worships&#8217; company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Od&#8217;s plessed will! I will not be absence at
the grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Shallow and Sir Hugh
Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please your worship to come in,
sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very
well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">The dinner attends you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
cousin Shallow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Simple</span></p>
<p class="speech">A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to
his
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
live like a poor gentleman born.</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">I may not go in without your worship: they will
not
sit till you come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, I&#8217;ll eat nothing; I thank
you as much as
though I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, walk in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather walk here, I thank you. I
bruised
my shin th&#8217; other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? be there bears i&#8217; the town?</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">I think there are, sir; I heard them talked
of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel
at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
the bear loose, are you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, indeed, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s meat and drink to me, now. I have
seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
indeed, cannot abide &#8217;em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come,
come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pray you, lead the way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff, Host,
Bardolph, Nym, Pistol, and Robin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mine host of the Garter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and
wisely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag;
trot, trot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I sit at ten pounds a week.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Thou&#8217;rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and
Pheezar. I
will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
tap: said I well, bully Hector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, good mine host.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I have spoke; let him follow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speech">Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word;
follow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good
trade:
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">It is a life that I have desired: I will
thrive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot
wield?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">He was gotten in drink: is not the humour
conceited?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox:
his
thefts were too open; his filching was like an
unskilful singer; he kept not time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">The good humour is to steal at a minute&#8217;s
rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Convey,&#8217; the wise it call.
&#8216;steal!&#8217; foh! a fico
for the phrase!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, let kibes ensue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must
shift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Young ravens must have food.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Which of you know Ford of this town?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">I ken the wight: he is of substance good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My honest lads, I will tell you what I am
about.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Two yards, and more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist
two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford&#8217;s
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, &#8216;I am Sir John Falstaff&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">He hath studied her will, and translated her
will,
out of honesty into English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Now, the report goes she has all the rule of
her
husband&#8217;s purse: he hath a legion of angels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">As many devils entertain; and &#8216;To her,
boy,&#8217; say I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">The humour rises; it is good: humour me the
angels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
another to Page&#8217;s wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Then did the sun on dunghill shine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee for that humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">O, she did so course o&#8217;er my exteriors with
such a
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here&#8217;s
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,<br>
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">I will run no base humour: here, take the
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Robin]</span> Hold,
sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;<br>
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.<br>
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;<br>
Trudge, plod away o&#8217; the hoof; seek shelter, pack!<br>
Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,<br>
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Falstaff and
Robin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam
holds,<br>
And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:<br>
Tester I&#8217;ll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,<br>
Base Phrygian Turk!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">I have operations which be humours of
revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou revenge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">By welkin and her star!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">With wit or steel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">With both the humours, I:<br>
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And I to Ford shall eke unfold<br>
How Falstaff, varlet vile,<br>
His dove will prove, his gold will hold,<br>
And his soft couch defile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page
to
deal with poison; I will possess him with
yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
that is my true humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee;
troop on.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mistress Quickly,
Simple, and Rugby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the
casement,
and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
Caius, coming. If he do, i&#8217; faith, and find any
body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
God&#8217;s patience and the king&#8217;s English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rugby</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll go watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Go; and we&#8217;ll have a posset for&#8217;t
soon at night, in
faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Rugby</span></p>
<p class="speech">An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever
servant
shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, for fault of a better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">And Master Slender&#8217;s your master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, forsooth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
glover&#8217;s paring-knife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with
a
little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">A softly-sprighted man, is he not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his
hands
as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
with a warrener.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">How say you? O, I should remember him: does he
not
hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, indeed, does he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune!
Tell
Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish&#8212;</p>

glad he is so quiet: if he

so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,

the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my
master,&#8212;I may call him my master, look you, for I

<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">You shall have An fool&#8217;s-head of your own.
No, I
know Anne&#8217;s mind for that: never a woman in Windsor

than I do with her, I thank heaven.</p>

<p class="speech">Yes, marry, have I; what of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is
such
another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
broke bread: we had an hour&#8217;s talk of that wart. I
