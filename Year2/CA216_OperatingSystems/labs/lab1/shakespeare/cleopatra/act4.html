<h4>Scene I. Before Alexandria. Octavius Caesar&#8217;s camp.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Octavius Caesar,
Agrippa, and Mecaenas, with his Army; Octavius Caesar reading a
letter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power<br>
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger<br>
He hath whipp&#8217;d with rods; dares me to personal combat,<br>
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know<br>
I have many other ways to die; meantime<br>
Laugh at his challenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar must think,<br>
When one so great begins to rage, he&#8217;s hunted<br>
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now<br>
Make boot of his distraction: never anger<br>
Made good guard for itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Let our best heads<br>
Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles<br>
We mean to fight: within our files there are,<br>
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,<br>
Enough to fetch him in. See it done:<br>
And feast the army; we have store to do&#8217;t,<br>
And they have earn&#8217;d the waste. Poor Antony!</p>

Domitius Enobarbus, Charmian, Iras, Alexas, with others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">He will not fight with me, Domitius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Why should he not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">He thinks, being twenty times of better
fortune,<br>
He is twenty men to one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, soldier,<br>
By sea and land I&#8217;ll fight: or I will live,<br>
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood<br>
Shall make it live again. Woo&#8217;t thou fight well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll strike, and cry &#8216;Take
all.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Well said; come on.<br>
Call forth my household servants: let&#8217;s to-night<br>
Be bounteous at our meal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter three or four
Servitors</span></p>

Thou hast been rightly honest;&#8212;so hast thou;&#8212;<br>
Thou,&#8212;and thou,&#8212;and thou:&#8212;you have served me
well,<br>
And kings have been your fellows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Domitius
Enobarbus]</span> What means this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Cleopatra]</span>
&#8217;Tis one of those odd
tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And thou art honest too.<br>
I wish I could be made so many men,<br>
And all of you clapp&#8217;d up together in<br>
An Antony, that I might do you service<br>
So good as you have done.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">The gods forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:<br>
Scant not my cups; and make as much of me<br>
As when mine empire was your fellow too,<br>
And suffer&#8217;d my command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Domitius
Enobarbus]</span> What does he mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Cleopatra]</span>

<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Tend me to-night;<br>
May be it is the period of your duty:<br>
Haply you shall not see me more; or if,<br>
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow<br>
You&#8217;ll serve another master. I look on you<br>
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,<br>
I turn you not away; but, like a master<br>
Married to your good service, stay till death:<br>
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,<br>
And the gods yield you for&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">What mean you, sir,<br>
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;<br>
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,<br>
Transform us not to women.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, ho, ho!<br>
Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!<br>
Grace grow where those drops fall!<br>
My hearty friends,<br>
You take me in too dolorous a sense;<br>
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you<br>
To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,<br>
I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you<br>
Where rather I&#8217;ll expect victorious life<br>
Than death and honour. Let&#8217;s to supper, come,<br>
And drown consideration.</p>

Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;<br>

Be brooch&#8217;d with me; if knife, drugs,
serpents, have<br>
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:<br>
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes<br>
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour<br>
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,&#8212;<br>
Help me, my women,&#8212;we must draw thee up:<br>
Assist, good friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">O, quick, or I am gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s sport indeed! How heavy weighs my
lord!<br>
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,<br>
That makes the weight: had I great Juno&#8217;s power,<br>
The strong-wing&#8217;d Mercury should fetch thee up,<br>
And set thee by Jove&#8217;s side. Yet come a little,&#8212;<br>
Wishes were ever fools,&#8212;O, come, come, come;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They heave Mark Antony aloft
to Cleopatra</span></p>
<p class="speech">And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast
lived:<br>
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,<br>
Thus would I wear them out.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">A heavy sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I am dying, Egypt, dying:<br>
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,<br>
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,<br>
Provoked by my offence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">One word, sweet queen:<br>
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">They do not go together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle, hear me:<br>
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">My resolution and my hands I&#8217;ll trust;<br>
None about Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">The miserable change now at my end<br>
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts<br>
In feeding them with those my former fortunes<br>
Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o&#8217; the world,<br>
The noblest; and do now not basely die,<br>
Not cowardly put off my helmet to<br>
My countryman,&#8212;a Roman by a Roman<br>
Valiantly vanquish&#8217;d. Now my spirit is going;<br>
I can no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Noblest of men, woo&#8217;t
die?<br>
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide<br>
In this dull world, which in thy absence is<br>
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Mark Antony dies</span></p>
<p class="speech">The crown o&#8217; the earth doth melt. My
lord!<br>
O, wither&#8217;d is the garland of the war,<br>
The soldier&#8217;s pole is fall&#8217;n: young boys and girls<br>
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,<br>
And there is nothing left remarkable<br>
Beneath the visiting moon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Faints</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O, quietness, lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">She is dead too, our sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O madam, madam, madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Royal Egypt, Empress!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace, Iras!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">No more, but e&#8217;en a woman, and
commanded<br>
By such poor passion as the maid that milks<br>
And does the meanest chares. It were for me<br>
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;<br>
To tell them that this world did equal theirs<br>
Till they had stol&#8217;n our jewel. All&#8217;s but naught;<br>
Patience is scottish, and impatience does<br>
Become a dog that&#8217;s mad: then is it sin<br>
To rush into the secret house of death,<br>
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?<br>
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!<br>
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,<br>
Our lamp is spent, it&#8217;s out! Good sirs, take heart:<br>
We&#8217;ll bury him; and then, what&#8217;s brave,
what&#8217;s noble,<br>
Let&#8217;s do it after the high Roman fashion,<br>
And make death proud to take us. Come, away:<br>
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:<br>
Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend<br>
But resolution, and the briefest end.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt; those above bearing
off Mark Antony&#8217;s body</span></p>
