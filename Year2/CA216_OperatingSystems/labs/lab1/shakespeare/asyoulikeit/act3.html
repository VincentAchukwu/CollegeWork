<h4>SCENE I. A room in the palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Frederick, Lords,
and Oliver</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:<br>
But were I not the better part made mercy,<br>
I should not seek an absent argument<br>
Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:<br>
Find out thy brother, wheresoe&#8217;er he is;<br>
Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living<br>
Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more<br>
To seek a living in our territory.<br>
Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine<br>
Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,<br>
Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth<br>
Of what we think against thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">O that your highness knew my heart in this!<br>
I never loved my brother in my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">More villain thou. Well, push him out of
doors;<br>
And let my officers of such a nature<br>
Make an extent upon his house and lands:<br>
Do this expediently and turn him going.</p>

<h4>SCENE II. The forest.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando, with a
paper</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:<br>
And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey<br>
With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,<br>
Thy huntress&#8217; name that my full life doth sway.<br>
O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books<br>
And in their barks my thoughts I&#8217;ll character;<br>
That every eye which in this forest looks<br>
Shall see thy virtue witness&#8217;d every where.<br>
Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree<br>
The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Corin and
Touchstone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">And how like you this shepherd&#8217;s life,
Master Touchstone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a
good
life, but in respect that it is a shepherd&#8217;s life,
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
like it very well; but in respect that it is
private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">No more but that I know the more one sickens
the
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
means and content is without three good friends;
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever
in
court, shepherd?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Then thou art damned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg,
all
on one side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">For not being at court? Your reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never
sawest
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
state, shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good
manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Instance, briefly; come, instance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Why, we are still handling our ewes, and
their
fells, you know, are greasy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Why, do not your courtier&#8217;s hands sweat?
and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, our hands are hard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow
again.<br>
A more sounder instance, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">And they are often tarred over with the surgery
of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier&#8217;s hands are perfumed with civet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of
a
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">You have too courtly a wit for me: I&#8217;ll
rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow
man!<br>
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat,
get
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man&#8217;s
happiness, glad of other men&#8217;s good, content with my
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">That is another simple sin in you, to bring the
ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
damned for this, the devil himself will have no
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst<br>
&#8217;scape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new
mistress&#8217;s brother.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rosalind, with a paper,
reading</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;From the east to western Ind,<br>
No jewel is like Rosalind.<br>
Her worth, being mounted on the wind,<br>
Through all the world bears Rosalind.<br>
All the pictures fairest lined<br>
Are but black to Rosalind.<br>
Let no fair be kept in mind<br>
But the fair of Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll rhyme you so eight years together,
dinners and
suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
right butter-women&#8217;s rank to market.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Out, fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">For a taste:<br>
If a hart do lack a hind,<br>
Let him seek out Rosalind.<br>
If the cat will after kind,<br>
So be sure will Rosalind.<br>
Winter garments must be lined,<br>
So must slender Rosalind.<br>
They that reap must sheaf and bind;<br>
Then to cart with Rosalind.<br>
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,<br>
Such a nut is Rosalind.<br>
He that sweetest rose will find<br>
Must find love&#8217;s prick and Rosalind.<br>
This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
infect yourself with them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll graff it with you, and then I shall
graff it
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
i&#8217; the country; for you&#8217;ll be rotten ere you be
half
ripe, and that&#8217;s the right virtue of the medlar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">You have said; but whether wisely or no, let
the
forest judge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Celia, with a
writing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand
aside.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span><br>
Why should this a desert be?<br>
For it is unpeopled? No:<br>
Tongues I&#8217;ll hang on every tree,<br>
That shall civil sayings show:<br>
Some, how brief the life of man<br>
Runs his erring pilgrimage,<br>
That the stretching of a span<br>
Buckles in his sum of age;<br>
Some, of violated vows<br>
&#8217;Twixt the souls of friend and friend:<br>
But upon the fairest boughs,<br>
Or at every sentence end,<br>
Will I Rosalinda write,<br>
Teaching all that read to know<br>
The quintessence of every sprite<br>
Heaven would in little show.<br>
Therefore Heaven Nature charged<br>
That one body should be fill&#8217;d<br>
With all graces wide-enlarged:<br>
Nature presently distill&#8217;d<br>
Helen&#8217;s cheek, but not her heart,<br>
Cleopatra&#8217;s majesty,<br>
Atalanta&#8217;s better part,<br>
Sad Lucretia&#8217;s modesty.<br>
Thus Rosalind of many parts<br>
By heavenly synod was devised,<br>
Of many faces, eyes and hearts,<br>
To have the touches dearest prized.<br>
Heaven would that she these gifts should have,<br>
And I to live and die her slave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of
love
have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
cried &#8216;Have patience, good people!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a
little.<br>
Go with him, sirrah.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable
retreat;
though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Corin and
Touchstone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou hear these verses?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some
of
them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s no matter: the feet might bear the
verses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">But didst thou hear without wondering how thy
name
should be hanged and carved upon these trees?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I was seven of the nine days out of the
wonder
before you came; for look here what I found on a
palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
Pythagoras&#8217; time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
can hardly remember.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Trow you who hath done this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Is it a man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">And a chain, that you once wore, about his
neck.
Change you colour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, who?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends
to
meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
and so encounter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but who is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Is it possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary
vehemence,
tell me who it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
out of all hooping!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I
am
caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
may drink thy tidings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">So you may put a man in your belly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Is he of God&#8217;s making? What manner of man?
Is his
head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he hath but a little beard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why, God will send more, if the man will be
thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">It is young Orlando, that tripped up the
wrestler&#8217;s
heels and your heart both in an instant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow
and
true maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, coz, &#8217;tis he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Orlando?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Orlando.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet
and
hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
him again? Answer me in one word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">You must borrow me Gargantua&#8217;s mouth first:
&#8217;tis a
word too great for any mouth of this age&#8217;s size. To
say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
answer in a catechism.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But doth he know that I am in this forest and
in
man&#8217;s apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
day he wrestled?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve
the
propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
finding him, and relish it with good observance.
I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">It may well be called Jove&#8217;s tree, when it
drops
forth such fruit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Give me audience, good madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded
knight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Though it be pity to see such a sight, it
well
becomes the ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Cry &#8216;holla&#8217; to thy tongue, I prithee;
it curvets
unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I would sing my song without a burden: thou
bringest
me out of tune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I
must
speak. Sweet, say on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando and
Jaques</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis he: slink by, and note him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I
had
as lief have been myself alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank
you
too for your society.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">God be wi&#8217; you: let&#8217;s meet as little
as we can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I do desire we may be better strangers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
love-songs in their barks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, mar no more of my verses with
reading
them ill-favouredly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Rosalind is your love&#8217;s name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, just.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I do not like her name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">There was no thought of pleasing you when she
was
christened.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">What stature is she of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Just as high as my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">You are full of pretty answers. Have you not
been
acquainted with goldsmiths&#8217; wives, and conned them
out of rings?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth,
from
whence you have studied your questions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">You have a nimble wit: I think &#8217;twas made
of
Atalanta&#8217;s heels. Will you sit down with me? and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I will chide no breather in the world but
myself,
against whom I know most faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">The worst fault you have is to be in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a fault I will not change for your
best virtue.
I am weary of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I
found
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and
you
shall see him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">There I shall see mine own figure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tarry no longer with you: farewell,
good
Signior Love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad of your departure: adieu, good
Monsieur
Melancholy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Jaques</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Celia]</span> I
will speak to him, like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear, forester?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Very well: what would you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, what is&#8217;t o&#8217;clock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">You should ask me what time o&#8217; day:
there&#8217;s no clock
in the forest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Then there is no true lover in the forest;
else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And why not the swift foot of Time? had not
that
been as proper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces
with
divers persons. I&#8217;ll tell you who Time ambles
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between
the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized: if the interim be but a se&#8217;nnight,
Time&#8217;s pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who ambles Time withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man
that
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who doth he gallop withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With a thief to the gallows, for though he go
as
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who stays it still withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep
between
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Are you native of this place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">As the cony that you see dwell where she is
kindled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I have been told so of many: but indeed an
old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Can you remember any of the principal evils that
he
laid to the charge of women?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">There were none principal; they were all like
one
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, recount some of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will not cast away my physic but on those
that
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
abuses our young plants with carving &#8216;Rosalind&#8217; on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell
me
your remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">There is none of my uncle&#8217;s marks upon you:
he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What were his marks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye
and
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother&#8217;s
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Me believe it! you may as soon make her that
you
love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
is so admired?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But are you so much in love as your rhymes
speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Neither rhyme nor reason can express how
much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you,
deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Did you ever cure any so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine
me
his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing, as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I would not be cured, youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I would cure you, if you would but call me
Rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
where it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Go with me to it and I&#8217;ll show it you and
by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart, good youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will
you go?</p>

<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Your features! Lord warrant us! what

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I am here with thee and thy goats, as the

capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O knowledge

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">When a man&#8217;s verses cannot be understood,
nor a
man&#8217;s good wit seconded with the forward child
Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
the gods had made thee poetical.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know what &#8216;poetical&#8217; is: is
it honest in
deed and word? is it a true thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Do you wish then that the gods had made me
poetical?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
hope thou didst feign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Would you not have me honest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured;
for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> A material

<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Well, I am not fair; and therefore
I pray the gods

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>

were to put good meat into an unclean dish.</p>

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I would fain

<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Well, the gods give us joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful
heart,
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
necessary. It is said, &#8216;many a man knows no end of
his goods:&#8217; right; many a man has good horns, and
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
his wife; &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns?
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Oliver
Martext</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will
you
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
with you to your chapel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Oliver Martext</p>
<p class="speech">Is there none here to give the woman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I will not take her on gift of any man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Oliver Martext</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not
lawful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Advancing]</span>
Proceed, proceed I&#8217;ll give her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Good even, good Master What-ye-call&#8217;t: how
do you,
sir? You are very well met: God &#8217;ild you for your
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be married, motley?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb
and
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">And will you, being a man of your breeding,
be
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
church, and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I am not in
the mind but I were better to be
married of him than of another: for he is not like
to marry me well; and not being well married, it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>

We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.<br>

<p class="speech">Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to
consider
that tears do not become a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But have I not cause to weep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">As good cause as one would desire; therefore
weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">His very hair is of the dissembling colour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Something browner than Judas&#8217;s marry, his
kisses are
Judas&#8217;s own children.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, his hair is of a good colour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the
only colour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the
touch
of holy bread.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a
nun
of winter&#8217;s sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
the very ice of chastity is in them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But why did he swear he would come this morning,
and
comes not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Do you think so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Not true in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">You have heard him swear downright he was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Was&#8217; is not &#8216;is:&#8217;
besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I met the duke yesterday and had much question
with
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
man as Orlando?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O, that&#8217;s a brave man! he writes brave
verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
goose: but all&#8217;s brave that youth mounts and folly
guides. Who comes here?</p>

After the shepherd that complain&#8217;d of love,<br>
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,<br>
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess<br>
That was his mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Well, and what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">If you will see a pageant truly play&#8217;d,<br>
Between the pale complexion of true love<br>
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,<br>
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,<br>
If you will mark it.</p>

In bitterness. The common executioner,<br>
Whose heart the accustom&#8217;d sight of death makes hard,<br>
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck<br>
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be<br>
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?</p>

<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">I would not be thy executioner:<br>
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.<br>
Thou tell&#8217;st me there is murder in mine eye:<br>
&#8217;Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,<br>
That eyes, that are the frail&#8217;st and softest things,<br>
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,<br>
Should be call&#8217;d tyrants, butchers, murderers!<br>
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;<br>
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:<br>
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;<br>
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,<br>
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!<br>
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:<br>
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains<br>
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,<br>
The cicatrice and capable impressure<br>
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,<br>
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,<br>
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes<br>
That can do hurt.</p>

If ever,&#8212;as that ever may be near,&#8212;<br>
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,<br>
Then shall you know the wounds invisible<br>
That love&#8217;s keen arrows make.</p>

<p class="speech">And why, I pray you? Who might be your
mother,<br>
That you insult, exult, and all at once,<br>
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,&#8212;<br>
As, by my faith, I see no more in you<br>
Than without candle may go dark to bed&#8212;<br>
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?<br>
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?<br>
I see no more in you than in the ordinary<br>
Of nature&#8217;s sale-work. &#8216;Od&#8217;s my little life,<br>
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!<br>
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:<br>
&#8217;Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,<br>
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,<br>
That can entame my spirits to your worship.<br>
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,<br>
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?<br>
You are a thousand times a properer man<br>
Than she a woman: &#8217;tis such fools as you<br>
That makes the world full of ill-favour&#8217;d children:<br>
&#8217;Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;<br>
And out of you she sees herself more proper<br>
Than any of her lineaments can show her.<br>
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,<br>
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man&#8217;s love:<br>
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,<br>
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:<br>
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:<br>
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.<br>
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</p>

Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.<br>
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,<br>

Were both extermined.</p>

<p class="speech">I would have you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, that were covetousness.<br>
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,<br>
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;<br>
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,<br>
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,<br>
I will endure, and I&#8217;ll employ thee too:<br>
But do not look for further recompense<br>
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">So holy and so perfect is my love,<br>
And I in such a poverty of grace,<br>
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop<br>
To glean the broken ears after the man<br>
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then<br>
A scatter&#8217;d smile, and that I&#8217;ll live upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>

erewhile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Not very well, but I have met him oft;<br>
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds<br>
That the old carlot once was master of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Think not I love him, though I ask for him:<br>
&#8217;Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;<br>
But what care I for words? yet words do well<br>
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.<br>
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:<br>
But, sure, he&#8217;s proud, and yet his pride becomes him:<br>
He&#8217;ll make a proper man: the best thing in him<br>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue<br>
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.<br>
He is not very tall; yet for his years he&#8217;s tall:<br>
His leg is but so so; and yet &#8217;tis well:<br>
There was a pretty redness in his lip,<br>
A little riper and more lusty red<br>
Than that mix&#8217;d in his cheek; &#8217;twas just the
difference<br>
Between the constant red and mingled damask.<br>
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark&#8217;d him<br>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<br>
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,<br>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet<br>
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:<br>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<br>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:<br>
And, now I am remember&#8217;d, scorn&#8217;d at me:<br>
I marvel why I answer&#8217;d not again:<br>
But that&#8217;s all one; omittance is no quittance.<br>
I&#8217;ll write to him a very taunting letter,<br>
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Phebe, with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
