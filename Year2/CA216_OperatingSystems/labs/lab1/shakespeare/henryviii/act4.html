<h4>Scene I. A street in Westminster.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two Gentlemen, meeting
one another</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re well met once again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">So are you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">You come to take your stand here, and behold<br>
The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis all my business. At our last
encounter,<br>
The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true: but that time offer&#8217;d
sorrow;<br>
This, general joy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well: the citizens,<br>
I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds&#8212;<br>
As, let &#8217;em have their rights, they are ever
forward&#8212;<br>
In celebration of this day with shows,<br>
Pageants and sights of honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Never greater,<br>
Nor, I&#8217;ll assure you, better taken, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">May I be bold to ask at what that contains,<br>
That paper in your hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Yes; &#8217;tis the list<br>
Of those that claim their offices this day<br>
By custom of the coronation.<br>
The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims<br>
To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,<br>
He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, sir: had I not known those
customs,<br>
I should have been beholding to your paper.<br>
But, I beseech you, what&#8217;s become of Katharine,<br>
The princess dowager? how goes her business?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">That I can tell you too. The Archbishop<br>
Of Canterbury, accompanied with other<br>
Learned and reverend fathers of his order,<br>
Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off<br>
From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which<br>
She was often cited by them, but appear&#8217;d not:<br>
And, to be short, for not appearance and<br>
The king&#8217;s late scruple, by the main assent<br>
Of all these learned men she was divorced,<br>
And the late marriage made of none effect<br>
Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,<br>
Where she remains now sick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, good lady!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets</span></p>
<p class="speech">The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is
coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hautboys</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Order Of The
Coronation</span></p>
<p class="speech">1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.<br>
2. Then, two Judges.<br>
3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace
before him.<br>
4. Choristers, singing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then
Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
head a gilt copper crown.<br>
6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,
on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With
him, Surrey, bearing the rod of silver with
the dove, crowned with an earl&#8217;s coronet.
Collars of Ss.<br>
7. Suffolk, in his robe of estate, his coronet
on his head, bearing a long white wand, as
high-steward. With him, Norfolk, with the
rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.
Collars of Ss.<br>
8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;
under it, Queen Anne in her robe; in her hair
richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each
side her, the Bishops of London and
Winchester.<br>
9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of
gold, wrought with flowers, bearing Queen
Anne&#8217;s train.<br>
10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain
circlets of gold without flowers.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They pass over the stage in
order and state</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">A royal train, believe me. These I know:<br>
Who&#8217;s that that bears the sceptre?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Marquess Dorset:<br>
And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">A bold brave gentleman. That should be<br>
The Duke of Suffolk?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the same: high-steward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">And that my Lord of Norfolk?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Yes;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven bless thee!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Looking on Queen
Anne</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look&#8217;d
on.<br>
Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;<br>
Our king has all the Indies in his arms,<br>
And more and richer, when he strains that lady:<br>
I cannot blame his conscience.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">They that bear<br>
The cloth of honour over her, are four barons<br>
Of the Cinque-ports.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Those men are happy; and so are all are near
her.<br>
I take it, she that carries up the train<br>
Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">It is; and all the rest are countesses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Their coronets say so. These are stars
indeed;<br>
And sometimes falling ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No more of that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit procession, and then a
great flourish of trumpets</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a third
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">God save you, sir! where have you been
broiling?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Among the crowd i&#8217; the Abbey; where a
finger<br>
Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled<br>
With the mere rankness of their joy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">You saw<br>
The ceremony?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">How was it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Well worth the seeing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, speak it to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">As well as I am able. The rich stream<br>
Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen<br>
To a prepared place in the choir, fell off<br>
A distance from her; while her grace sat down<br>
To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,<br>
In a rich chair of state, opposing freely<br>
The beauty of her person to the people.<br>
Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman<br>
That ever lay by man: which when the people<br>
Had the full view of, such a noise arose<br>
As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,<br>
As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks&#8212;<br>
Doublets, I think,&#8212;flew up; and had their faces<br>
Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy<br>
I never saw before. Great-bellied women,<br>
That had not half a week to go, like rams<br>
In the old time of war, would shake the press,<br>
And make &#8217;em reel before &#8217;em. No man living<br>
Could say &#8216;This is my wife&#8217; there; all were woven<br>
So strangely in one piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">But, what follow&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">At length her grace rose, and with modest
paces<br>
Came to the altar; where she kneel&#8217;d, and saint-like<br>
Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray&#8217;d devoutly.<br>
Then rose again and bow&#8217;d her to the people:<br>
When by the Archbishop of Canterbury<br>
She had all the royal makings of a queen;<br>
As holy oil, Edward Confessor&#8217;s crown,<br>
The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems<br>
Laid nobly on her: which perform&#8217;d, the choir,<br>
With all the choicest music of the kingdom,<br>
Together sung &#8216;Te Deum.&#8217; So she parted,<br>
And with the same full state paced back again<br>
To York-place, where the feast is held.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
You must no more call it York-place, that&#8217;s past;<br>
For, since the cardinal fell, that title&#8217;s lost:<br>
&#8217;Tis now the king&#8217;s, and call&#8217;d Whitehall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I know it;<br>
But &#8217;tis so lately alter&#8217;d, that the old name<br>
Is fresh about me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What two reverend bishops<br>
Were those that went on each side of the queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,<br>
Newly preferr&#8217;d from the king&#8217;s secretary,<br>
The other, London.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He of Winchester<br>
Is held no great good lover of the archbishop&#8217;s,<br>
The virtuous Cranmer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">All the land knows that:<br>
However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,<br>
Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Who may that be, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Thomas Cromwell;<br>
A man in much esteem with the king, and truly<br>
A worthy friend. The king has made him master<br>
O&#8217; the jewel house,<br>
And one, already, of the privy council.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">He will deserve more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, without all doubt.<br>
Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which<br>
Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:<br>
Something I can command. As I walk thither,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell ye more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You may command us, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
</div>
<div id="act4.2" class="scene" title="Scene II. Kimbolton.">
<h4>Scene II. Kimbolton.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Katharine, Dowager,
sick; led between Griffith, her gentleman usher, and Patience, her
woman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">How does your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">O Griffith, sick to death!<br>
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,<br>
Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:<br>
So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.<br>
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led&#8217;st me,<br>
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yes, madam; but I think your
grace,<br>
Out of the pain you suffer&#8217;d, gave no ear to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:<br>
If well, he stepp&#8217;d before me, happily<br>
For my example.</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Well, the voice goes, madam:<br>
For after the stout Earl Northumberland<br>
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,<br>
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,<br>
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill<br>
He could not sit his mule.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">At last, with easy roads, he came to
Leicester,<br>
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,<br>
With all his covent, honourably received him;<br>
To whom he gave these words, &#8216;O, father abbot,<br>
An old man, broken with the storms of state,<br>
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;<br>
Give him a little earth for charity!&#8217;<br>
So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness<br>
Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,<br>
About the hour of eight, which he himself<br>
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,<br>
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,<br>
He gave his honours to the world again,<br>
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!<br>
Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,<br>
And yet with charity. He was a man<br>
Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking<br>
Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,<br>
Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;<br>
His own opinion was his law: i&#8217; the presence<br>
He would say untruths; and be ever double<br>
Both in his words and meaning: he was never,<br>
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:<br>
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;<br>
But his performance, as he is now, nothing:<br>
Of his own body he was ill, and gave<br>
The clergy in example.</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">Noble madam,<br>
Men&#8217;s evil manners live in brass; their virtues<br>
We write in water. May it please your highness<br>
To hear me speak his good now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, good Griffith;<br>
I were malicious else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">This cardinal,<br>
Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly<br>
Was fashion&#8217;d to much honour from his cradle.<br>
He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;<br>
Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:<br>
Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;<br>
But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.<br>
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,<br>
Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,<br>
He was most princely: ever witness for him<br>
Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,<br>
Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,<br>
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;<br>
The other, though unfinish&#8217;d, yet so famous,<br>
So excellent in art, and still so rising,<br>
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.<br>
His overthrow heap&#8217;d happiness upon him;<br>
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,<br>
And found the blessedness of being little:<br>
And, to add greater honours to his age<br>
Than man could give him, he died fearing God.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">After my death I wish no other herald,<br>
No other speaker of my living actions,<br>
To keep mine honour from corruption,<br>
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.<br>
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,<br>
With thy religious truth and modesty,<br>
Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!<br>
Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:<br>
I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,<br>
Cause the musicians play me that sad note<br>
I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating<br>
On that celestial harmony I go to.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sad and solemn
music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">She is asleep: good wench, let&#8217;s sit down
quiet,<br>
For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The vision. Enter, solemnly
tripping one after another, six personages, clad in white robes,
wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden vizards on
their faces; branches of bays or palm in their hands. They first
congee unto her, then dance; and, at certain changes, the first two
hold a spare garland over her head; at which the other four make
reverent curtsies; then the two that held the garland deliver the
same to the other next two, who observe the same order in their
changes, and holding the garland over her head: which done, they
deliver the same garland to the last two, who likewise observe the
same order: at which, as it were by inspiration, she makes in her
sleep signs of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven: and
so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them. The
music continues</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all
gone,<br>
And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we are here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">It is not you I call for:<br>
Saw ye none enter since I slept?</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">None, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop<br>
Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces<br>
Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?<br>
They promised me eternal happiness;<br>
And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel<br>
I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams<br>
Possess your fancy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Bid the music leave,<br>
They are harsh and heavy to me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music ceases</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Patience</p>
<p class="speech">Do you note<br>
How much her grace is alter&#8217;d on the sudden?<br>
How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,<br>
And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">She is going, wench: pray, pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patience</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven comfort her!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t like your grace,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">You are a saucy fellow:<br>
Deserve we no more reverence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Griffith</p>
<p class="speech">You are to blame,<br>
Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,<br>
To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly do entreat your highness&#8217;
pardon;<br>
My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying<br>
A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow<br>
Let me ne&#8217;er see again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Griffith and
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Griffith, with
Capucius</span></p>
<p class="speech">If my sight fail not,<br>
You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,<br>
My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capucius</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, the same; your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">O, my lord,<br>
The times and titles now are alter&#8217;d strangely<br>
With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,<br>
What is your pleasure with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capucius</p>
<p class="speech">Noble lady,<br>
First mine own service to your grace; the next,<br>
The king&#8217;s request that I would visit you;<br>
Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me<br>
Sends you his princely commendations,<br>
And heartily entreats you take good comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;<br>
&#8217;Tis like a pardon after execution:<br>
That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;<br>
But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.<br>
How does his highness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capucius</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, in good health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">So may he ever do! and ever flourish,<br>
When I shal l dwell with worms, and my poor name<br>
Banish&#8217;d the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,<br>
I caused you write, yet sent away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Patience</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving it to
Katharine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver<br>
This to my lord the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capucius</p>
<p class="speech">Most willing, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">In which I have commended to his goodness<br>
The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;<br>
The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!<br>
Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding&#8212;<br>
She is young, and of a noble modest nature,<br>
I hope she will deserve well,&#8212;and a little<br>
To love her for her mother&#8217;s sake, that loved him,<br>
Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition<br>
Is, that his noble grace would have some pity<br>
Upon my wretched women, that so long<br>
Have follow&#8217;d both my fortunes faithfully:<br>
Of which there is not one, I dare avow,<br>
And now I should not lie, but will deserve<br>
For virtue and true beauty of the soul,<br>
For honesty and decent carriage,<br>
A right good husband, let him be a noble<br>
And, sure, those men are happy that shall have &#8217;em.<br>
The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,<br>
But poverty could never draw &#8217;em from me;<br>
That they may have their wages duly paid &#8217;em,<br>
And something over to remember me by:<br>
If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life<br>
And able means, we had not parted thus.<br>
These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,<br>
By that you love the dearest in this world,<br>
As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,<br>
Stand these poor people&#8217;s friend, and urge the king<br>
To do me this last right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capucius</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I will,<br>
Or let me lose the fashion of a man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, honest lord. Remember me<br>
In all humility unto his highness:<br>
Say his long trouble now is passing<br>
Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless&#8217;d him,<br>
For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,<br>
My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,<br>
You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;<br>
Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,<br>
Let me be used with honour: strew me over<br>
With maiden flowers, that all the world may know<br>
I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,<br>
Then lay me forth: although unqueen&#8217;d, yet like<br>
A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.<br>
I can no more.</p>
