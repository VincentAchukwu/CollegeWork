<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> is a pastoral comedy written by William
Shakespeare, in 1599 or early 1600. <em>As You Like It</em> was
listed in the Stationers&#8217; Register, the period equivalent of
copyright, in August 1600. No printed copy of it is known prior to
the publication of the First Folio of Shakespeare&#8217;s collected
works in 1623. The real life village of Hampton-in-Arden was used
as the setting for the play.</p>
<p>Shakespeare drew the story for <em>As You Like It</em> from a
story called &#8220;Rosalynde, Euphues&#8217; Golden Legacy&#8221;
written by Thomas Lodge and published in 1590. In
Shakespeare&#8217;s version, Frederick has usurped the Duchy and
exiled his older brother, referred to only as the Duke. The
Duke&#8217;s daughter Rosalind has been permitted to remain at
court because she is the closest friend of Frederick&#8217;s only
child, Celia. Orlando, a young gentleman of the duchy who has
fallen in love with Rosalind, is forced to flee his home after
being persecuted by his older brother, Oliver. Frederick becomes
angry and orders Rosalind to flee his court. Celia and Rosalind
decide to flee together accompanied by the jester Touchstone, with
Rosalind disguised as a young man.</p>
<p>Rosalind, now known as Ganymede, and Celia, now known as Aliena,
arrive in the Forest of Arden, where the exiled Duke now lives with
some supporters, including Jacques. Orlando has found the Duke and
his men already and is living with them and posting love poems for
Rosalind on the trees. Rosalind, also in love with Orlando, meets
him as Ganymede and pretends to counsel him to cure him of being in
love. Meanwhile, the shepherdess Phebe, with whom Silvius is in
love, has fallen in love with Ganymede.</p>
<p>Orlando sees Oliver in the forest and rescues him from a
lioness, causing Oliver to repent of mistreating Orlando. Oliver
meets Aliena and falls in love with her, and they agree to marry.
Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, Silvius and Phebe, and
Touchstone and Audrey all are married in the final scene, after
which they discover that Frederick has also repented his faults,
deciding to restore his legitimate brother to the dukedom and adopt
a religious life.</p>
<p>The elaborate gender reversals in the story are of particular
interest to many modern critics with their love of gender analysis.
At one point, Rosalind &#8212; who in Shakespeare&#8217;s day would
have been a boy playing a girl &#8212; becomes a girl pretending to
be a boy pretending to be a girl.</p>
<p>In Act II, Scene 7, line 138, it features one of
Shakespeare&#8217;s greatest monologues, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All the world&#8217;s a stage<br>
And all the men and women merely players;<br>
They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> also features much humorous and clever
wordplay, and several entangled love affairs, all in a serene
pastoral setting which makes it often especially effective staged
outdoors in a park or similar site.</p>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> has always been among the most produced
of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays.</p>

"SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver&#8217;s house.">
<h4>SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando and
Adam</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder comes my master, your brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he
will
shake me up.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Oliver</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir! what make you here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">What mar you then, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which
God
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught
awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with
them?
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
come to such penury?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Know you where your are, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Know you before whom, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I
know
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">What, boy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in
this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet masters, be patient: for your
father&#8217;s
remembrance, be at accord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Let me go, I say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I will not, till I please: you shall hear me.
My
father charged you in his will to give me good
education: you have trained me like a peasant,
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is
spent?
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
pray you, leave me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I will no further offend you than becomes me for
my good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Get you with him, you old dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">Is &#8216;old dog&#8217; my reward? Most true, I
have lost my
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Orlando and
Adam</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I
will
physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dennis</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dennis</p>
<p class="speech">Calls your worship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Was not Charles, the duke&#8217;s wrestler, here
to speak with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dennis</p>
<p class="speech">So please you, he is here at the door and
importunes
access to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Call him in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Dennis</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the
wrestling is.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Charles</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow to your worship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Good Monsieur Charles, what&#8217;s the new news
at the
new court?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no news at the court, sir, but the
old news:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke&#8217;s
daughter, be
banished with her father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">O, no; for the duke&#8217;s daughter, her cousin,
so loves
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Where will the old duke live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">They say he is already in the forest of Arden,
and
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new
duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with
a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me,
which
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother&#8217;s purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it, but he is resolute. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Charles:
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man&#8217;s
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to&#8217;t; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta&#8217;en thy life by some indirect means or other;
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he
come
to-morrow, I&#8217;ll give him his payment: if ever he go
alone again, I&#8217;ll never wrestle for prize more: and
so God keep your worship!</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, good Charles.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Charles</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall
see
an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than he. Yet he&#8217;s gentle, never
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither; which now I&#8217;ll go about.</p>

<h4>SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Celia and
Rosalind</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be
merry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress
of;
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full
weight
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I will forget the condition of my estate,
to
rejoice in yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">You know my father hath no child but I, nor none
is
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports.
Let
me see; what think you of falling in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal:
but
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">What shall be our sport, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune
from
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I would we could do so, for her benefits are
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; for those that she makes fair
she scarce
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, now thou goest from Fortune&#8217;s office
to
Nature&#8217;s: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
not in the lineaments of Nature.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Touchstone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may
she
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature,
when
Fortune makes Nature&#8217;s natural the cutter-off of
Nature&#8217;s wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Peradventure this is not Fortune&#8217;s work
neither, but
Nature&#8217;s; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
wit! whither wander you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress, you must come away to your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Were you made the messenger?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Where learned you that oath, fool?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Of a certain knight that swore by his honour
they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I&#8217;ll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins,
and
swear by your beards that I am a knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">By our beards, if we had them, thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if
you
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, who is&#8217;t that thou meanest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">One that old Frederick, your father, loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">My father&#8217;s love is enough to honour him:
enough!
speak no more of him; you&#8217;ll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely
what
wise men do foolishly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the
little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>

<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their
young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Then shall we be news-crammed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">All the better; we shall be the more
marketable.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Le Beau</span></p>
<p class="speech">Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what&#8217;s the
news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Sport! of what colour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">As wit and fortune will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Or as the Destinies decree.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if I keep not my rank,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Thou losest thy old smell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of
good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">You tell us the manner of the wrestling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you the beginning; and, if it
please
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
to perform it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">There comes an old man and his three
sons,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I could match this beginning with an old
tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Three proper young men, of excellent growth and
presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With bills on their necks, &#8216;Be it known
unto all men
by these presents.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles,
the
duke&#8217;s wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Alas!</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">But what is the sport, monsieur, that the
ladies
have lost?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this that I speak of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the
first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Or I, I promise thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But is there any else longs to see this broken
music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">You must, if you stay here; for here is the
place
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
perform it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay
and see it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter Duke
Frederick, Lords, Orlando, Charles, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Come on: since the youth will not be entreated,
his
own peril on his forwardness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Is yonder the man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Even he, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, he is too young! yet he looks
successfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept
hither
to see the wrestling?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">You will take little delight in it, I can tell
you;
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
challenger&#8217;s youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
you can move him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Do so: I&#8217;ll not be by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I attend them with all respect and duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Young man, have you challenged Charles the
wrestler?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">No, fair princess; he is the general challenger:
I
come but in, as others do, to try with him the
strength of my youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for
your
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man&#8217;s
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Do, young sir; your reputation shall not
therefore
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
the world I fill up a place, which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">The little strength that I have, I would it were
with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">And mine, to eke out hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in
you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Your heart&#8217;s desires be with you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Come, where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest
working.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">You shall try but one fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat
him
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">An you mean to mock me after, you should not
have
mocked me before: but come your ways.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
fellow by the leg.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They wrestle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent young man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell
who
should down.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Shout. Charles is
thrown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">No more, no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well
breathed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou, Charles?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot speak, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">I would thou hadst been son to some man else:<br>
The world esteem&#8217;d thy father honourable,<br>
But I did find him still mine enemy:<br>
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,<br>
Hadst thou descended from another house.<br>
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:<br>
I would thou hadst told me of another father.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Duke Frederick, train,
and Le Beau</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Were I my father, coz, would I do this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I am more proud to be Sir Rowland&#8217;s
son,<br>
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,<br>
To be adopted heir to Frederick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,<br>
And all the world was of my father&#8217;s mind:<br>
Had I before known this young man his son,<br>
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,<br>
Ere he should thus have ventured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle cousin,<br>
Let us go thank him and encourage him:<br>
My father&#8217;s rough and envious disposition<br>
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:<br>
If you do keep your promises in love<br>
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,<br>
Your mistress shall be happy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Gentleman,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving him a chain from her
neck</span></p>
<p class="speech">Wear this for me, one out of suits with
fortune,<br>
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.<br>
Shall we go, coz?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay. Fare you well, fair
gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts<br>
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up<br>
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">He calls us back: my pride fell with my
fortunes;<br>
I&#8217;ll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?<br>
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown<br>
More than your enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Will you go, coz?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Have with you. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosalind and
Celia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What passion hangs these weights upon my
tongue?<br>
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.<br>
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!<br>
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Le Beau</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you<br>
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved<br>
High commendation, true applause and love,<br>
Yet such is now the duke&#8217;s condition<br>
That he misconstrues all that you have done.<br>
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,<br>
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me
this:<br>
Which of the two was daughter of the duke<br>
That here was at the wrestling?</p>
<p class="speaker">Le Beau</p>
<p class="speech">Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;<br>
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter<br>
The other is daughter to the banish&#8217;d duke,<br>
And here detain&#8217;d by her usurping uncle,<br>
To keep his daughter company; whose loves<br>
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.<br>
But I can tell you that of late this duke<br>
Hath ta&#8217;en displeasure &#8217;gainst his gentle niece,<br>
Grounded upon no other argument<br>
But that the people praise her for her virtues<br>
And pity her for her good father&#8217;s sake;<br>
And, on my life, his malice &#8217;gainst the lady<br>
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:<br>
Hereafter, in a better world than this,<br>
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Le Beau</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;<br>
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:<br>
But heavenly Rosalind!</p>

<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not
a word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Not one to throw at a dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">No, thy words are too precious to be cast away
upon
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.</p>

without any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">But is all this for your father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, some of it is for my child&#8217;s father. O,
how
full of briers is this working-day world!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee

myself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time,
in
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland&#8217;s youngest son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">The duke my father loved his father dearly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his
son
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Let me love him for that, and do you love him
because I do. Look, here comes the duke.</p>

<p class="speech">You, cousin<br>
Within these ten days if that thou be&#8217;st found<br>
So near our public court as twenty miles,<br>
Thou diest for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I do beseech your grace,<br>
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:<br>
If with myself I hold intelligence<br>
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,<br>
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,&#8212;<br>
As I do trust I am not&#8212;then, dear uncle,<br>
Never so much as in a thought unborn<br>
Did I offend your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Thus do all traitors:<br>
If their purgation did consist in words,<br>
They are as innocent as grace itself:<br>
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>

So was I when your highness banish&#8217;d him:<br>
Treason is not inherited, my lord;<br>
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,<br>
What&#8217;s that to me? my father was no traitor:<br>
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much<br>
To think my poverty is treacherous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Dear sovereign, hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Celia; we stay&#8217;d her for your sake,<br>
Else had she with her father ranged along.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I did not then entreat to have her stay;<br>
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:<br>
I was too young that time to value her;<br>
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,<br>
Why so am I; we still have slept together,<br>
Rose at an instant, learn&#8217;d, play&#8217;d, eat together,<br>
And wheresoever we went, like Juno&#8217;s swans,<br>
Still we went coupled and inseparable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">She is too subtle for thee; and her
smoothness,<br>
Her very silence and her patience<br>
Speak to the people, and they pity her.<br>
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;<br>
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous<br>
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:<br>
Firm and irrevocable is my doom<br>

Prithee be cheerful: know&#8217;st thou not, the duke<br>
Hath banish&#8217;d me, his daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">That he hath not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love<br>
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:<br>
Shall we be sunder&#8217;d? shall we part, sweet girl?<br>
No: let my father seek another heir.<br>
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,<br>
Whither to go and what to bear with us;<br>
And do not seek to take your change upon you,<br>
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;<br>
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,<br>
Say what thou canst, I&#8217;ll go along with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why, whither shall we go?</p>

Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!<br>
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.</p>

Because that I am more than common tall,<br>
That I did suit me all points like a man?<br>
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,<br>
A boar-spear in my hand; and&#8212;in my heart<br>
Lie there what hidden woman&#8217;s fear there will&#8212;<br>

No longer Celia, but Aliena.</p>

The clownish fool out of your father&#8217;s court?<br>
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll go along o&#8217;er the wide world
with me;<br>
Leave me alone to woo him. Let&#8217;s away,<br>
And get our jewels and our wealth together,<br>
Devise the fittest time and safest way<br>
To hide us from pursuit that will be made<br>
After my flight. Now go we in content<br>
To liberty and not to banishment.</p>

Should in their own confines with forked heads<br>
Have their round haunches gored.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord,<br>
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,<br>
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp<br>
Than doth your brother that hath banish&#8217;d you.<br>
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself<br>
Did steal behind him as he lay along<br>
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out<br>
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:<br>
To the which place a poor sequester&#8217;d stag,<br>
That from the hunter&#8217;s aim had ta&#8217;en a hurt,<br>
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,<br>
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans<br>
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat<br>
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears<br>
Coursed one another down his innocent nose<br>
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool<br>
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,<br>
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,<br>
Augmenting it with tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">But what said Jaques?<br>
Did he not moralize this spectacle?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, into a thousand similes.<br>
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;<br>
&#8216;Poor deer,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;thou makest a
testament<br>
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more<br>
To that which had too much:&#8217; then, being there alone,<br>
Left and abandon&#8217;d of his velvet friends,<br>
&#8216;&#8217;Tis right:&#8217; quoth he; &#8216;thus misery doth
part<br>
The flux of company:&#8217; anon a careless herd,<br>
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him<br>
And never stays to greet him; &#8216;Ay&#8217; quoth Jaques,<br>
&#8216;Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;<br>
&#8217;Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look<br>
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?&#8217;<br>
Thus most invectively he pierceth through<br>
The body of the country, city, court,<br>
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we<br>
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what&#8217;s worse,<br>
To fright the animals and to kill them up<br>
In their assign&#8217;d and native dwelling-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">And did you leave him in this contemplation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">We did, my lord, weeping and commenting<br>
Upon the sobbing deer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Show me the place:<br>

For then he&#8217;s full of matter.</p>

O my sweet master! O you memory<br>
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?<br>
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?<br>
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?<br>
Why would you be so fond to overcome<br>
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?<br>
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<br>
Know you not, master, to some kind of men<br>
Their graces serve them but as enemies?<br>
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,<br>
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.<br>
O, what a world is this, when what is comely<br>
Envenoms him that bears it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">O unhappy youth!<br>
Come not within these doors; within this roof<br>
The enemy of all your graces lives:<br>
Your brother&#8212;no, no brother; yet the son&#8212;<br>
Yet not the son, I will not call him son<br>
Of him I was about to call his father&#8212;<br>
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<br>
To burn the lodging where you use to lie<br>
And you within it: if he fail of that,<br>
He will have other means to cut you off.<br>
I overheard him and his practises.<br>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:<br>
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>

<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">No matter whither, so you come not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my
food?<br>
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce<br>
A thievish living on the common road?<br>
This I must do, or know not what to do:<br>
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;<br>
I rather will subject me to the malice<br>
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,<br>
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,<br>
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse<br>
When service should in my old limbs lie lame<br>
And unregarded age in corners thrown:<br>
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,<br>
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,<br>
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;<br>
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:<br>
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;<br>
For in my youth I never did apply<br>
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,<br>
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<br>
The means of weakness and debility;<br>
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,<br>
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;<br>
I&#8217;ll do the service of a younger man<br>
In all your business and necessities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">O good old man, how well in thee appears<br>
The constant service of the antique world,<br>
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!<br>
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<br>
Where none will sweat but for promotion,<br>
And having that, do choke their service up<br>
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.<br>
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,<br>
That cannot so much as a blossom yield<br>
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry<br>
But come thy ways; well go along together,<br>
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,<br>
We&#8217;ll light upon some settled low content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">Master, go on, and I will follow thee,<br>
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.<br>
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore<br>
Here lived I, but now live here no more.<br>
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;<br>
But at fourscore it is too late a week:<br>
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better<br>

&#8216;Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me
fortune:&#8217;<br>

&#8217;Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,<br>
And after one hour more &#8217;twill be eleven;<br>
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,<br>
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;<br>
And thereby hangs a tale.&#8217; When I did hear<br>
The motley fool thus moral on the time,<br>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,<br>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,<br>
And I did laugh sans intermission<br>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!<br>

After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm&#8217;d<br>
With observation, the which he vents<br>

Provided that you weed your better judgments<br>
Of all opinion that grows rank in them<br>
That I am wise. I must have liberty<br>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,<br>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;<br>
And they that are most galled with my folly,<br>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?<br>
The &#8216;why&#8217; is plain as way to parish church:<br>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit<br>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,<br>
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,<br>
The wise man&#8217;s folly is anatomized<br>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<br>
Invest me in my motley; give me leave<br>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<br>
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,<br>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">What, for a counter, would I do but good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:<br>
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,<br>
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;<br>
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,<br>
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,<br>
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Why, who cries out on pride,<br>
That can therein tax any private party?<br>
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,<br>
Till that the weary very means do ebb?<br>
What woman in the city do I name,<br>
When that I say the city-woman bears<br>
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?<br>
Who can come in and say that I mean her,<br>
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?<br>
Or what is he of basest function<br>
That says his bravery is not of my cost,<br>
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits<br>
His folly to the mettle of my speech?<br>
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein<br>
My tongue hath wrong&#8217;d him: if it do him right,<br>
Then he hath wrong&#8217;d himself; if he be free,<br>
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,<br>
Unclaim&#8217;d of any man. But who comes here?</p>

Or else a rude despiser of good manners,<br>
That in civility thou seem&#8217;st so empty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">You touch&#8217;d my vein at first: the thorny
point<br>
Of bare distress hath ta&#8217;en from me the show<br>
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred<br>
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:<br>
He dies that touches any of this fruit<br>
Till I and my affairs are answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">An you will not be answered with reason, I must

More than your force move us to gentleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I almost die for food; and let me have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:<br>
I thought that all things had been savage here;<br>
And therefore put I on the countenance<br>
Of stern commandment. But whate&#8217;er you are<br>
That in this desert inaccessible,<br>
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,<br>
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time<br>
If ever you have look&#8217;d on better days,<br>
If ever been where bells have knoll&#8217;d to church,<br>
If ever sat at any good man&#8217;s feast,<br>
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear<br>
And know what &#8217;tis to pity and be pitied,<br>
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:<br>
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">True is it that we have seen better days,<br>
And have with holy bell been knoll&#8217;d to church<br>
And sat at good men&#8217;s feasts and wiped our eyes<br>
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender&#8217;d:<br>
And therefore sit you down in gentleness<br>
And take upon command what help we have<br>
That to your wanting may be minister&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Then but forbear your food a little while,<br>
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn<br>
And give it food. There is an old poor man,<br>
Who after me hath many a weary step<br>
Limp&#8217;d in pure love: till he be first sufficed,<br>
Oppress&#8217;d with two weak evils, age and hunger,<br>
I will not touch a bit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Go find him out,<br>
And we will nothing waste till you return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I thank ye; and be blest for your good
comfort!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:<br>
This wide and universal theatre<br>
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene<br>
Wherein we play in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">All the world&#8217;s a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players:<br>
They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br>
Mewling and puking in the nurse&#8217;s arms.<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress&#8217; eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
Even in the cannon&#8217;s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
Into the lean and slipper&#8217;d pantaloon,<br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,<br>
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>

Touchstone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">And how like you this shepherd&#8217;s life,
Master Touchstone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a
good
life, but in respect that it is a shepherd&#8217;s life,
it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
like it very well; but in respect that it is
private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">No more but that I know the more one sickens
the
worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
means and content is without three good friends;
that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever
in
court, shepherd?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Then thou art damned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg,
all
on one side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">For not being at court? Your reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never
sawest
good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
state, shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good
manners
at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
behavior of the country is most mockable at the
court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Instance, briefly; come, instance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Why, we are still handling our ewes, and
their
fells, you know, are greasy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Why, do not your courtier&#8217;s hands sweat?
and is not
the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, our hands are hard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow
again.<br>
A more sounder instance, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">And they are often tarred over with the surgery
of
our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
courtier&#8217;s hands are perfumed with civet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of
a
good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">You have too courtly a wit for me: I&#8217;ll
rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow
man!<br>
God make incision in thee! thou art raw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat,
get
that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man&#8217;s
happiness, glad of other men&#8217;s good, content with my
harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
graze and my lambs suck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">That is another simple sin in you, to bring the
ewes
and the rams together and to offer to get your
living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
damned for this, the devil himself will have no
shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst<br>
&#8217;scape.</p>

Then to cart with Rosalind.<br>
Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,<br>
Such a nut is Rosalind.<br>
He that sweetest rose will find<br>
Must find love&#8217;s prick and Rosalind.<br>

infect yourself with them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.</p>

<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll graff it with you, and then I shall
graff it
with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
i&#8217; the country; for you&#8217;ll be rotten ere you be
half
ripe, and that&#8217;s the right virtue of the medlar.</p>

themselves without the verse and therefore stood
lamely in the verse.</p>

<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I was seven of the nine days out of the

quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-

<p class="speech">I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I
had
as lief have been myself alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank
you
too for your society.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">God be wi&#8217; you: let&#8217;s meet as little
as we can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I do desire we may be better strangers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
love-songs in their barks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, mar no more of my verses with
reading
them ill-favouredly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Rosalind is your love&#8217;s name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, just.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I do not like her name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">There was no thought of pleasing you when she
was
christened.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">What stature is she of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Just as high as my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">You are full of pretty answers. Have you not
been
acquainted with goldsmiths&#8217; wives, and conned them
out of rings?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth,
from
whence you have studied your questions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">You have a nimble wit: I think &#8217;twas made
of
Atalanta&#8217;s heels. Will you sit down with me? and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I will chide no breather in the world but
myself,
against whom I know most faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">The worst fault you have is to be in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a fault I will not change for your
best virtue.
I am weary of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I
found
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>

you

<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>

Melancholy.</p>

<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Celia]</span> I
will speak to him, like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear, forester?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Very well: what would you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, what is&#8217;t o&#8217;clock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">You should ask me what time o&#8217; day:
there&#8217;s no clock
in the forest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Then there is no true lover in the forest;
else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And why not the swift foot of Time? had not
that
been as proper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces
with
divers persons. I&#8217;ll tell you who Time ambles
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, who doth he trot withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between
the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized: if the interim be but a se&#8217;nnight,
Time&#8217;s pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who ambles Time withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man
that
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who doth he gallop withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With a thief to the gallows, for though he go
as
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who stays it still withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep
between
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Where dwell you, pretty youth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Are you native of this place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">As the cony that you see dwell where she is
kindled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I have been told so of many: but indeed an
old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Can you remember any of the principal evils that
he
laid to the charge of women?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">There were none principal; they were all like
one
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, recount some of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will not cast away my physic but on those
that
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
abuses our young plants with carving &#8216;Rosalind&#8217; on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell
me
your remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">There is none of my uncle&#8217;s marks upon you:
he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What were his marks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye
and
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother&#8217;s
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Me believe it! you may as soon make her that
you
love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
is so admired?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But are you so much in love as your rhymes
speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Neither rhyme nor reason can express how
much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you,
deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Did you ever cure any so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine
me
his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing, as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep&#8217;s
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I would not be cured, youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I would cure you, if you would but call me
Rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
where it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Go with me to it and I&#8217;ll show it you and
by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart, good youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will
you go?</p>

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">When a man&#8217;s verses cannot be understood,
nor a
man&#8217;s good wit seconded with the forward child
Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
the gods had made thee poetical.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know what &#8216;poetical&#8217; is: is
it honest in
deed and word? is it a true thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Do you wish then that the gods had made me
poetical?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
hope thou didst feign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Audrey</p>
<p class="speech">Would you not have me honest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured;

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Well, I am not fair; and therefore

<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been

<p class="speech">Well, the gods give us joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful
heart,
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
necessary. It is said, &#8216;many a man knows no end of
his goods:&#8217; right; many a man has good horns, and
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
his wife; &#8217;tis none of his own getting. Horns?
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Oliver
Martext</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will
you
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go

<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be married, motley?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>

and
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">And will you, being a man of your breeding,
be
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
church, and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I am not in
the mind but I were better to be
married of him than of another: for he is not like
to marry me well; and not being well married, it

<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, his hair is of a good colour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the

<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the

<p class="speech">Do you think so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Not true in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.</p>

<p class="speech">You have heard him swear downright he was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Was&#8217; is not &#8216;is:&#8217;
besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I met the duke yesterday and had much question
with
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
man as Orlando?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O, that&#8217;s a brave man! he writes brave
verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble

<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">But till that time<br>
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,<br>
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;<br>
As till that time I shall not pity thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And why, I pray you? Who might be your
mother,<br>
That you insult, exult, and all at once,<br>
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,&#8212;<br>
As, by my faith, I see no more in you<br>
Than without candle may go dark to bed&#8212;<br>
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?<br>
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?<br>
I see no more in you than in the ordinary<br>
Of nature&#8217;s sale-work. &#8216;Od&#8217;s my little life,<br>
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!<br>
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:<br>
&#8217;Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,<br>
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,<br>
That can entame my spirits to your worship.<br>
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,<br>
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?<br>
You are a thousand times a properer man<br>
Than she a woman: &#8217;tis such fools as you<br>
That makes the world full of ill-favour&#8217;d children:<br>
&#8217;Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;<br>
And out of you she sees herself more proper<br>
Than any of her lineaments can show her.<br>
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,<br>
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man&#8217;s love:<br>
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,<br>
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:<br>
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:<br>
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.<br>
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year
together:<br>
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s fallen in love with your foulness and
she&#8217;ll
fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
she answers thee with frowning looks, I&#8217;ll sauce her
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">For no ill will I bear you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, do not fall in love with me,<br>
For I am falser than vows made in wine:<br>
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,<br>
&#8217;Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.<br>
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.<br>
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,<br>
And be not proud: though all the world could see,<br>
None could be so abused in sight as he.<br>
Come, to our flock.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosalind, Celia and
Corin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,<br>
&#8216;Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Phebe,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ha, what say&#8217;st thou,
Silvius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Phebe, pity me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:<br>
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,<br>
By giving love your sorrow and my grief<br>
Were both extermined.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">I would have you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, that were covetousness.<br>
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,<br>
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;<br>
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,<br>
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,<br>
I will endure, and I&#8217;ll employ thee too:<br>
But do not look for further recompense<br>
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">So holy and so perfect is my love,<br>
And I in such a poverty of grace,<br>
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop<br>
To glean the broken ears after the man<br>
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then<br>
A scatter&#8217;d smile, and that I&#8217;ll live upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Know&#8217;st now the youth that spoke to me
erewhile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Not very well, but I have met him oft;<br>
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds<br>
That the old carlot once was master of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">Think not I love him, though I ask for him:<br>
&#8217;Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;<br>
But what care I for words? yet words do well<br>
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.<br>
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:<br>
But, sure, he&#8217;s proud, and yet his pride becomes him:<br>
He&#8217;ll make a proper man: the best thing in him<br>
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue<br>
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.<br>
He is not very tall; yet for his years he&#8217;s tall:<br>
His leg is but so so; and yet &#8217;tis well:<br>
There was a pretty redness in his lip,<br>
A little riper and more lusty red<br>
Than that mix&#8217;d in his cheek; &#8217;twas just the
difference<br>
Between the constant red and mingled damask.<br>
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark&#8217;d him<br>
In parcels as I did, would have gone near<br>
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,<br>
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet<br>
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:<br>
For what had he to do to chide at me?<br>
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:<br>
And, now I am remember&#8217;d, scorn&#8217;d at me:<br>
I marvel why I answer&#8217;d not again:<br>
But that&#8217;s all one; omittance is no quittance.<br>
I&#8217;ll write to him a very taunting letter,<br>
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Phebe, with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll write it straight;<br>
The matter&#8217;s in my head and in my heart:<br>
I will be bitter with him and passing short.<br>
Go with me, Silvius.</p>

<h4>SCENE I. The forest.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rosalind, Celia, and
Jaques</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better
acquainted
with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">They say you are a melancholy fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I am so; I do love it better than laughing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Those that are in extremity of either are
abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis good to be sad and say
nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, &#8217;tis good to be a post.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">I have neither the scholar&#8217;s melancholy,
which is
emulation, nor the musician&#8217;s, which is fantastical,
nor the courtier&#8217;s, which is proud, nor the
soldier&#8217;s, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer&#8217;s,
which is politic, nor the lady&#8217;s, which is nice, nor
the lover&#8217;s, which is all these: but it is a
melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry&#8217;s
contemplation of my travels, in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason
to
be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
other men&#8217;s; then, to have seen much and to have
nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I have gained my experience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And your experience makes you sad: I had rather
have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad; and to travel for it too!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then, God be wi&#8217; you, an you talk in
blank verse.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp
and
wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
own country, be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide God for making you that countenance you
are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
another trick, never come in my sight more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my
promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Break an hour&#8217;s promise in love! He that
will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
hath clapped him o&#8217; the shoulder, but I&#8217;ll warrant
him heart-whole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, dear Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my
sight: I
had as lief be wooed of a snail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Of a snail?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly,
he
carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
his destiny with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is
virtuous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And I am your Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
Rosalind of a better leer than you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a
holiday
humour and like enough to consent. What would you
say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I would kiss before I spoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you were better speak first, and when you
were
gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking&#8212;God
warn us!&#8212;matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">How if the kiss be denied?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins
new matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who could be out, being before his beloved
mistress?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress,
or
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What, of my suit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your
suit.
Am not I your Rosalind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I take some joy to say you are, because I would
be
talking of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Well in her person I say I will not have you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Then in mine own person I die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person,
videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was &#8216;Hero of Sestos.&#8217;
But these are all lies: men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I would not have my right Rosalind of this
mind,
for, I protest, her frown might kill me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come,
now
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Then love me, Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And wilt thou have me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and twenty such.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What sayest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Are you not good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I hope so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, can one desire too much of a good
thing?
Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Pray thee, marry us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot say the words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">You must begin, &#8216;Will you,
Orlando&#8212;&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this
Rosalind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but when?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Why now; as fast as she can marry us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Then you must say &#8216;I take thee, Rosalind,
for wife.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I might ask you for your commission; but I do
take
thee, Orlando, for my husband: there&#8217;s a girl goes
before the priest; and certainly a woman&#8217;s thought
runs before her actions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">So do all thoughts; they are winged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Now tell me how long you would have her after
you
have possessed her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">For ever and a day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Say &#8216;a day,&#8217; without the
&#8217;ever.&#8217; No, no, Orlando;
men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
that when thou art inclined to sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">But will my Rosalind do so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By my life, she will do as I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">O, but she is wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Or else she could not have the wit to do this:
the
wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman&#8217;s
wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
&#8217;twill out at the key-hole; stop that, &#8217;twill fly
with the smoke out at the chimney.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might
say
&#8216;Wit, whither wilt?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you
met
your wife&#8217;s wit going to your neighbour&#8217;s bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">And what wit could wit have to excuse that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You
shall
never take her without her answer, unless you take
her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
make her fault her husband&#8217;s occasion, let her
never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
it like a fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two
hours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I must attend the duke at dinner: by two
o&#8217;clock I
will be with thee again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what
you
would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
won me: &#8217;tis but one cast away, and so, come,
death! Two o&#8217;clock is your hour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sweet Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God
mend
me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
your promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">With no less religion than if thou wert indeed
my
Rosalind: so adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Time is the old justice that examines all
such
offenders, and let Time try: adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Orlando</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">You have simply misused our sex in your
love-prate:
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
her own nest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that
thou
didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
bottom, like the bay of Portugal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you
pour
affection in, it runs out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was
begot
of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one&#8217;s eyes
because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
am in love. I&#8217;ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
of the sight of Orlando: I&#8217;ll go find a shadow and
sigh till he come.</p>

A freestone-colour&#8217;d hand; I verily did think<br>
That her old gloves were on, but &#8217;twas her hands:<br>
She has a huswife&#8217;s hand; but that&#8217;s no matter:<br>
I say she never did invent this letter;<br>
This is a man&#8217;s invention and his hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, it is hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis a boisterous and a cruel
style.<br>
A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,<br>
Like Turk to Christian: women&#8217;s gentle brain<br>
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention<br>
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect<br>
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">So please you, for I never heard it yet;<br>
Yet heard too much of Phebe&#8217;s cruelty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads</span></p>
<p class="speech">Art thou god to shepherd turn&#8217;d,<br>
That a maiden&#8217;s heart hath burn&#8217;d?<br>
Can a woman rail thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Call you this railing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span><br>
Why, thy godhead laid apart,<br>
Warr&#8217;st thou with a woman&#8217;s heart?<br>
Did you ever hear such railing?<br>
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,<br>
That could do no vengeance to me.<br>
Meaning me a beast.<br>
If the scorn of your bright eyne<br>
Have power to raise such love in mine,<br>
Alack, in me what strange effect<br>
Would they work in mild aspect!<br>
Whiles you chid me, I did love;<br>
How then might your prayers move!<br>
He that brings this love to thee<br>
Little knows this love in me:<br>
And by him seal up thy mind;<br>
Whether that thy youth and kind<br>
Will the faithful offer take<br>
Of me and all that I can make;<br>
Or else by him my love deny,<br>
And then I&#8217;ll study how to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">Call you this chiding?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor shepherd!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity.
Wilt
thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Silvius</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you
know,<br>
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands<br>
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">West of this place, down in the neighbour
bottom:<br>
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream<br>
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.<br>
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;<br>
There&#8217;s none within.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">If that an eye may profit by a tongue,<br>
Then should I know you by description;<br>
Such garments and such years: &#8216;The boy is fair,<br>
Of female favour, and bestows himself<br>
Like a ripe sister: the woman low<br>
And browner than her brother.&#8217; Are not you<br>
The owner of the house I did inquire for?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">It is no boast, being ask&#8217;d, to say we
are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Orlando doth commend him to you both,<br>
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind<br>
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I am: what must we understand by this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Some of my shame; if you will know of me<br>
What man I am, and how, and why, and where<br>
This handkercher was stain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, tell it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">When last the young Orlando parted from you<br>
He left a promise to return again<br>
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,<br>
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,<br>
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,<br>
And mark what object did present itself:<br>
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss&#8217;d with age<br>
And high top bald with dry antiquity,<br>
A wretched ragged man, o&#8217;ergrown with hair,<br>
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck<br>
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,<br>
Who with her head nimble in threats approach&#8217;d<br>
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,<br>
Seeing Orlando, it unlink&#8217;d itself,<br>
And with indented glides did slip away<br>
Into a bush: under which bush&#8217;s shade<br>
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,<br>
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,<br>
When that the sleeping man should stir; for &#8217;tis<br>
The royal disposition of that beast<br>
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:<br>
This seen, Orlando did approach the man<br>
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">O, I have heard him speak of that same
brother;<br>
And he did render him the most unnatural<br>
That lived amongst men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">And well he might so do,<br>
For well I know he was unnatural.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,<br>
Food to the suck&#8217;d and hungry lioness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;<br>
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,<br>
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,<br>
Made him give battle to the lioness,<br>
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling<br>
From miserable slumber I awaked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Are you his brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Wast you he rescued?</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Was&#8217;t you that did so oft contrive to kill
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas I; but &#8217;tis not I I do not
shame<br>
To tell you what I was, since my conversion<br>
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But, for the bloody napkin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">By and by.<br>
When from the first to last betwixt us two<br>
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,<br>
As how I came into that desert place:&#8212;<br>
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,<br>
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,<br>
Committing me unto my brother&#8217;s love;<br>
Who led me instantly unto his cave,<br>
There stripp&#8217;d himself, and here upon his arm<br>
The lioness had torn some flesh away,<br>
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted<br>
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.<br>
Brief, I recover&#8217;d him, bound up his wound;<br>
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,<br>
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,<br>
To tell this story, that you might excuse<br>
His broken promise, and to give this napkin<br>
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth<br>
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Rosalind swoons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Many will swoon when they do look on blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Look, he recovers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were at home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll lead you thither.<br>
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack
a
man&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body
would
think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">This was not counterfeit: there is too great
testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
of earnest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Counterfeit, I assure you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to
be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">So I do: but, i&#8217; faith, I should have been
a woman by right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you look paler and paler: pray you,
draw
homewards. Good sir, go with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oliver</p>
<p class="speech">That will I, for I must bear answer back<br>
How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I shall devise something: but, I pray you,
commend
my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?</p>

<p class="speech">Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a

&#8216;The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
knows himself to be a fool.&#8217; The heathen
philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
lips to open. You do love this maid?</p>

consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
shall be to your good; for my father&#8217;s house and all

<p class="speech">Ay, and greater wonders than that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O, I know where you are: nay, &#8217;tis true:
there was
never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
and Caesar&#8217;s thrasonical brag of &#8216;I came, saw, and
overcame:&#8217; for your brother and my sister no sooner
met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
cannot part them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid
the
duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
is to look into happiness through another man&#8217;s
eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.</p>

<p class="speech">Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for
Rosalind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I can live no longer by thinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I will weary you then no longer with idle
talking.
Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
since I was three year old, conversed with a
magician, most profound in his art and yet not
damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
as she is and without any danger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Speakest thou in sober meanings?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though

It was a lover and his lass,<br>
&emsp;With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,<br>
That o&#8217;er the green corn-field did pass<br>
&emsp;In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,<br>
When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:<br>
Sweet lovers love the spring.<br><br>
Between the acres of the rye,<br>
&emsp;With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino<br>
These pretty country folks would lie,<br>
&emsp;In spring time, &amp; c.<br><br>
This carol they began that hour,<br>

How that a life was but a flower<br>
&emsp;In spring time, &amp; c.<br><br>

<h4>SCENE IV. The forest.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Senior, Amiens,
Jaques, Orlando, Oliver, and Celia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy<br>
Can do all this that he hath promised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rosalind, Silvius, and
Phebe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Patience once more, whiles our compact is
urged:<br>
You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,<br>
You will bestow her on Orlando here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">That would I, had I kingdoms to give with
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">And you say, you will have her, when I bring
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">You say, you&#8217;ll marry me, if I be
willing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Phebe</p>
<p class="speech">That will I, should I die the hour after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">But if you do refuse to marry me,<br>
You&#8217;ll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?</p>

<p class="speech">You say, that you&#8217;ll have Phebe, if she

Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;<br>
You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:<br>
Keep your word, Phebe, that you&#8217;ll marry me,<br>
Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:<br>
Keep your word, Silvius, that you&#8217;ll marry her.<br>
If she refuse me: and from hence I go,<br>
To make these doubts all even.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosalind and
Celia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">I do remember in this shepherd boy<br>
Some lively touches of my daughter&#8217;s favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the first time that I ever saw him<br>
Methought he was a brother to your daughter:<br>
But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,<br>
And hath been tutor&#8217;d in the rudiments<br>
Of many desperate studies by his uncle,<br>
Whom he reports to be a great magician,<br>
Obscured in the circle of this forest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Touchstone and
Audrey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">There is, sure, another flood toward, and
these
couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Salutation and greeting to you all!</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">And how was that ta&#8217;en up?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon
the
seventh cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this
fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">I like him very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">God &#8217;ild you, sir; I desire you of the
like. I
press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">By my faith, he is very swift and
sententious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">According to the fool&#8217;s bolt, sir, and such
dulcet diseases.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">But, for the seventh cause; how did you find
the
quarrel on the seventh cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Upon a lie seven times removed:&#8212;bear your
body more
seeming, Audrey:&#8212;as thus, sir. I did dislike the
cut of a certain courtier&#8217;s beard: he sent me word,
if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
If I sent him word again &#8216;it was not well cut,&#8217; he
would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
this is called the Quip Modest. If again &#8216;it was
not well cut,&#8217; he disabled my judgment: this is
called the Reply Churlish. If again &#8216;it was not
well cut,&#8217; he would answer, I spake not true: this
is called the Reproof Valiant. If again &#8216;it was not
well cut,&#8217; he would say I lied: this is called the
Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">And how oft did you say his beard was not well
cut?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I durst go no further than the Lie
Circumstantial,
nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
measured swords and parted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the
lie?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you
have
books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
of an If, as, &#8216;If you said so, then I said so;&#8217; and
they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
only peacemaker; much virtue in If.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he&#8217;s as
good at
any thing and yet a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and
under
the presentation of that he shoots his wit.</p>

I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,<br>
That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.<br>
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day<br>
Men of great worth resorted to this forest,<br>
Address&#8217;d a mighty power; which were on foot,<br>
In his own conduct, purposely to take<br>
His brother here and put him to the sword:<br>
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;<br>
Where meeting with an old religious man,<br>
After some question with him, was converted<br>
Both from his enterprise and from the world,<br>
His crown bequeathing to his banish&#8217;d brother,<br>
And all their lands restored to them again<br>
That were with him exiled. This to be true,<br>
I do engage my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, young man;<br>
Thou offer&#8217;st fairly to thy brothers&#8217; wedding:<br>
To one his lands withheld, and to the other<br>
A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.<br>
First, in this forest, let us do those ends<br>
That here were well begun and well begot:<br>
And after, every of this happy number<br>
That have endured shrewd days and nights with us<br>
Shall share the good of our returned fortune,<br>
According to the measure of their states.<br>
Meantime, forget this new-fall&#8217;n dignity<br>
And fall into our rustic revelry.<br>
Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,<br>
With measure heap&#8217;d in joy, to the measures fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">It is not the fashion to see the lady the
epilogue;
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
no bush, &#8217;tis true that a good play needs no
epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
and good plays prove the better by the help of good
epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
become me: my way is to conjure you; and I&#8217;ll begin
with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
you bear to women&#8212;as I perceive by your simpering,
none of you hates them&#8212;that between you and the
women the play may please. If I were a woman I
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</p>
