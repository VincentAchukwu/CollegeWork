<h4>Scene I. King Lear&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Kent, Gloucester, and
Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I thought the king had more affected the Duke
of<br>
Albany than Cornwall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either&#8217;s moiety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this your son, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I
have
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
brazed to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot conceive you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, this young fellow&#8217;s mother could:
whereupon
she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
Do you smell a fault?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of
it
being so proper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some
year
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
honourable friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">My services to your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I must love you, and sue to know you better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He hath been out nine years, and away he
shall
again. The king is coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Enter King Lear,
Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,
Gloucester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I shall, my liege.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gloucester and
Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br>
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided<br>
In three our kingdom: and &#8217;tis our fast intent<br>
To shake all cares and business from our age;<br>
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br>
Unburthen&#8217;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br>
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br>
We have this hour a constant will to publish<br>
Our daughters&#8217; several dowers, that future strife<br>
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br>
Great rivals in our youngest daughter&#8217;s love,<br>
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br>
And here are to be answer&#8217;d. Tell me, my
daughters,&#8212;<br>
Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br>
Interest of territory, cares of state,&#8212;<br>
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br>
That we our largest bounty may extend<br>
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,<br>
Our eldest-born, speak first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I love you more than words can wield the
matter;<br>
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;<br>
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;<br>
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br>
As much as child e&#8217;er loved, or father found;<br>
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;<br>
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What shall
Cordelia do?<br>
Love, and be silent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Of all these bounds, even from this line to
this,<br>
With shadowy forests and with champains rich&#8217;d,<br>
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br>
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany&#8217;s issue<br>
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,<br>
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I am made<br>
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,<br>
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br>
I find she names my very deed of love;<br>
Only she comes too short: that I profess<br>
Myself an enemy to all other joys,<br>
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;<br>
And find I am alone felicitate<br>
In your dear highness&#8217; love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Then poor
Cordelia!<br>
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love&#8217;s<br>
More richer than my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">To thee and thine hereditary ever<br>
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br>
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,<br>
Than that conferr&#8217;d on Goneril. Now, our joy,<br>
Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br>
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br>
Strive to be interess&#8217;d; what can you say to draw<br>
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br>
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond; nor more nor less.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a
little,<br>
Lest it may mar your fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,<br>
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I<br>
Return those duties back as are right fit,<br>
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br>
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say<br>
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br>
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br>
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br>
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,<br>
To love my father all.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">But goes thy heart with this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">So young, and so untender?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">So young, my lord, and true.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:<br>
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br>
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;<br>
By all the operation of the orbs<br>
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;<br>
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br>
Propinquity and property of blood,<br>
And as a stranger to my heart and me<br>
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br>
Or he that makes his generation messes<br>
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br>
Be as well neighbour&#8217;d, pitied, and relieved,<br>
As thou my sometime daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Good my liege,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, Kent!<br>
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br>
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest<br>
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!<br>
So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br>
Her father&#8217;s heart from her! Call France; who stirs?<br>
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,<br>
With my two daughters&#8217; dowers digest this third:<br>
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br>
I do invest you jointly with my power,<br>
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects<br>
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br>
With reservation of an hundred knights,<br>
By you to be sustain&#8217;d, shall our abode<br>
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain<br>
The name, and all the additions to a king;<br>
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,<br>
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,<br>
This coronet part betwixt you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving the crown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Royal Lear,<br>
Whom I have ever honour&#8217;d as my king,<br>
Loved as my father, as my master follow&#8217;d,<br>
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">The bow is bent and drawn, make from the
shaft.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br>
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,<br>
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?<br>
Think&#8217;st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,<br>
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour&#8217;s bound,<br>
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;<br>
And, in thy best consideration, cheque<br>
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,<br>
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br>
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br>
Reverbs no hollowness.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Kent, on thy life, no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">My life I never held but as a pawn<br>
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,<br>
Thy safety being the motive.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Out of my sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">See better, Lear; and let me still remain<br>
The true blank of thine eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Apollo,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now, by Apollo, king,<br>
Thou swear&#8217;st thy gods in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O, vassal! miscreant!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laying his hand on his
sword</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Dear sir, forbear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Do:<br>
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br>
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;<br>
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee thou dost evil.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, recreant!<br>
On thine allegiance, hear me!<br>
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,<br>
Which we durst never yet, and with strain&#8217;d pride<br>
To come between our sentence and our power,<br>
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,<br>
Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br>
Five days we do allot thee, for provision<br>
To shield thee from diseases of the world;<br>
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br>
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,<br>
Thy banish&#8217;d trunk be found in our dominions,<br>
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,<br>
This shall not be revoked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt
appear,<br>
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Cordelia</span></p>
<p class="speech">The gods to their dear shelter take thee,
maid,<br>
That justly think&#8217;st, and hast most rightly said!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Regan and
Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">And your large speeches may your deeds
approve,<br>
That good effects may spring from words of love.<br>
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br>
He&#8217;ll shape his old course in a country new.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Re-enter
Gloucester, with King Of France, Burgundy, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s France and Burgundy, my noble
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Burgundy.<br>
We first address towards you, who with this king<br>
Hath rivall&#8217;d for our daughter: what, in the least,<br>
Will you require in present dower with her,<br>
Or cease your quest of love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Most royal majesty,<br>
I crave no more than what your highness offer&#8217;d,<br>
Nor will you tender less.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Right noble Burgundy,<br>
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br>
But now her price is fall&#8217;n. Sir, there she stands:<br>
If aught within that little seeming substance,<br>
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,<br>
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br>
She&#8217;s there, and she is yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I know no answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br>
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,<br>
Dower&#8217;d with our curse, and stranger&#8217;d with our
oath,<br>
Take her, or leave her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, royal sir;<br>
Election makes not up on such conditions.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made
me,<br>
I tell you all her wealth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To King Of France</span></p>
<p class="speech">For you, great king,<br>
I would not from your love make such a stray,<br>
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br>
To avert your liking a more worthier way<br>
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed<br>
Almost to acknowledge hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">This is most strange,<br>
That she, that even but now was your best object,<br>
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br>
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br>
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br>
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence<br>
Must be of such unnatural degree,<br>
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch&#8217;d affection<br>
Fall&#8217;n into taint: which to believe of her,<br>
Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br>
Could never plant in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">I yet beseech your majesty,&#8212;<br>
If for I want that glib and oily art,<br>
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,<br>
I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t before I speak,&#8212;that you make known<br>
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br>
No unchaste action, or dishonour&#8217;d step,<br>
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;<br>
But even for want of that for which I am richer,<br>
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br>
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br>
Hath lost me in your liking.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Better thou<br>
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Is it but this,&#8212;a tardiness in nature<br>
Which often leaves the history unspoke<br>
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,<br>
What say you to the lady? Love&#8217;s not love<br>
When it is mingled with regards that stand<br>
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?<br>
She is herself a dowry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Royal Lear,<br>
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,<br>
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br>
Duchess of Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father<br>
That you must lose a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Peace be with Burgundy!<br>
Since that respects of fortune are his love,<br>
I shall not be his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being
poor;<br>
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!<br>
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:<br>
Be it lawful I take up what&#8217;s cast away.<br>
Gods, gods! &#8217;tis strange that from their cold&#8217;st
neglect<br>
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.<br>
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,<br>
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:<br>
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy<br>
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.<br>
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:<br>

Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;<br>

Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:<br>
To your professed bosoms I commit him<br>
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br>

<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s most certain, and with you; next
month with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">You see how full of changes his age is; the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little: he always loved our sister most; and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath
ever
but slenderly known himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">The best and soundest of his time hath been
but
rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Such unconstant starts are we like to have
from
him as this of Kent&#8217;s banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">There is further compliment of leavetaking
between France and him. Pray you, let&#8217;s hit
together: if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears, this last
surrender of his will but offend us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch

not such need to hide itself. Let&#8217;s see: come,

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

policy and reverence of age makes
the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
brother, Edgar.&#8217;</p>

Hum&#8212;conspiracy!&#8212;&#8217;sleep till I waked

should enjoy half his revenue,&#8217;&#8212;My son Edgar!
Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
to breed it in?&#8212;When came this to you? who
brought it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">It was not brought me, my lord; there&#8217;s
the
cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
casement of my closet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">You know the character to be your

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

it were his; but, in respect of that, I would

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this
business?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
and fathers declining, the father should be as
ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
seek him; I&#8217;ll apprehend him: abominable villain!
Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I do not well know, my lord. If it shall
please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
course; where, if you violently proceed against
him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour, and to no further
pretence of danger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Think you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">If your honour judge it meet, I will place
you
where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
that without any further delay than this very evening.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot be such a monster&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Nor is not, sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
myself, to be in a due resolution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">These late eclipses in the sun and moon
portend
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
palaces, treason; and the bond cracked &#8217;twixt son
and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there&#8217;s son against father: the king
falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against
child. We have seen the best of our time:
machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
offence, honesty! &#8217;Tis strange.</p>

<p class="speech">This is the excellent foppery of the world,
that,
when we are sick in fortune,&#8212;often the surfeit
of our own behavior,&#8212;we make guilty of our
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
if we were villains by necessity; fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star! My
father compounded with my mother under the
dragon&#8217;s tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
major; so that it follows, I am rough and
lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
had the maidenliest star in the firmament

<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">How now, brother Edmund! what serious
contemplation are you in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I promise you, the effects he writes of
succeed
unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles; needless
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, two hours together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Parted you in good terms? Found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">None at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Bethink yourself wherein you may have
offended
him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
in him, that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Some villain hath done me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s my fear. I pray you, have a
continent
forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there&#8217;s my key:
if you do stir abroad, go armed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Armed, brother!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed:
I
am no honest man if there be any good meaning
towards you: I have told you what I have seen
and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
and horror of it: pray you, away.</p>

both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o&#8217;er
the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak

<p class="speech">I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
they&#8217;ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou&#8217;lt

whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
kind o&#8217; thing than a fool: and yet I would not be

To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,<br>
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.<br>
That you protect this course, and put it on<br>
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br>

Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;<br>

For instant remedy: be then desired<br>
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,<br>
A little to disquantity your train;<br>

But that I told him, the revenging gods<br>
&#8217;Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;<br>
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond<br>
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,<br>
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood<br>
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,<br>
With his prepared sword, he charges home<br>
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:<br>
But when he saw my best alarum&#8217;d spirits,<br>
Bold in the quarrel&#8217;s right, roused to the encounter,<br>
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,<br>
Full suddenly he fled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;<br>
And found&#8212;dispatch. The noble duke my master,<br>
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:<br>
By his authority I will proclaim it,<br>
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,<br>
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;<br>
He that conceals him, death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">When I dissuaded him from his intent,<br>
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech<br>

&#8216;Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,<br>
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal<br>
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee<br>
Make thy words faith&#8217;d? No: what I should deny,&#8212;<br>
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce<br>
My very character,&#8212;I&#8217;ld turn it all<br>
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:<br>
And thou must make a dullard of the world,<br>
If they not thought the profits of my death<br>
Were very pregnant and potential spurs<br>
To make thee seek it.&#8217;</p>

<p class="speech">Hark, the duke&#8217;s trumpets! I know not why
he comes.<br>
All ports I&#8217;ll bar; the villain shall not &#8217;scape;<br>
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture<br>
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom<br>
May have the due note of him; and of my land,<br>
Loyal and natural boy, I&#8217;ll work the means<br>
To make thee capable.</p>

I have this present evening from my sister<br>
Been well inform&#8217;d of them; and with such cautions,<br>

Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br>

To answer from our home; the several messengers<br>
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,<br>
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow<br>

<p class="speech">A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats;
a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,

knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon

<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">That such a slave as this should wear a
sword,<br>
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,<br>
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain<br>
Which are too intrinse t&#8217; unloose; smooth every passion<br>
That in the natures of their lords rebel;<br>
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;<br>
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br>
With every gale and vary of their masters,<br>
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.<br>
A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br>
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br>
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,<br>

offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>

<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor
hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, &#8217;tis my occupation to be plain:<br>
I have seen better faces in my time<br>
Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br>
Before me at this instant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">This is some fellow,<br>
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect<br>
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb<br>
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,<br>
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!<br>
An they will take it, so; if not, he&#8217;s plain.<br>
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness<br>
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends<br>
Than twenty silly ducking observants<br>
That stretch their duties nicely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,<br>
Under the allowance of your great aspect,<br>
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br>
On flickering Phoebus&#8217; front,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">What mean&#8217;st by this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">To go out of my dialect, which you
discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
to entreat me to &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">What was the offence you gave him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">I never gave him any:<br>
It pleased the king his master very late<br>
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br>
When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,<br>
Tripp&#8217;d me behind; being down, insulted, rail&#8217;d,<br>
And put upon him such a deal of man,<br>
That worthied him, got praises of the king<br>
For him attempting who was self-subdued;<br>
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br>
Drew on me here again.</p>

You shall do small respect, show too bold malice<br>

You should not use me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, being his knave, I will.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stocks brought out</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let me beseech your grace not to do so:<br>
His fault is much, and the good king his master<br>

Is such as basest and contemned&#8217;st wretches<br>
For pilferings and most common trespasses<br>
Are punish&#8217;d with: the king must take it ill,<br>
That he&#8217;s so slightly valued in his messenger,<br>

<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll answer that.</p>

Shall see their children kind.<br>
Fortune, that arrant whore,<br>
Ne&#8217;er turns the key to the poor.<br>

<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll set thee to school to an ant, to

there&#8217;s no labouring i&#8217; the winter. All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
there&#8217;s not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that&#8217;s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
following it: but the great one that goes up the
hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.<br>
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,<br>
And follows but for form,<br>
Will pack when it begins to rain,<br>
And leave thee in the storm,<br>

And let the wise man fly:<br>
The knave turns fool that runs away;<br>
The fool no knave, perdy.</p>

I am now from home, and out of that provision<br>
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Return to her, and fifty men dismiss&#8217;d?<br>
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br>
To wage against the enmity o&#8217; the air;<br>
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,&#8212;<br>
Necessity&#8217;s sharp pinch! Return with her?<br>
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br>
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br>
To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg<br>
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br>

I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:<br>
We&#8217;ll no more meet, no more see one another:<br>
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br>
Or rather a disease that&#8217;s in my flesh,<br>
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,<br>
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,<br>
In my corrupted blood. But I&#8217;ll not chide thee;<br>
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:<br>
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,<br>
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:<br>
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:<br>
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,<br>
I and my hundred knights.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Not altogether so:<br>
I look&#8217;d not for you yet, nor am provided<br>
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br>
For those that mingle reason with your passion<br>
Must be content to think you old, and so&#8212;<br>
But she knows what she does.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Is this well spoken?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?<br>
Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br>
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br>
Speak &#8217;gainst so great a number? How, in one house,<br>
Should many people, under two commands,<br>
Hold amity? &#8217;Tis hard; almost impossible.</p>

<p class="speech">Why might not you, my lord, receive
attendance<br>
From those that she calls servants or from mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack
you,<br>
We could control them. If you will come to me,&#8212;<br>
For now I spy a danger,&#8212;I entreat you<br>

<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br>
But kept a reservation to be follow&#8217;d<br>
With such a number. What, must I come to you<br>
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">And speak&#8217;t again, my lord; no more with

<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">What need one?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O, reason not the need: our basest beggars<br>
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:<br>
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br>
Man&#8217;s life&#8217;s as cheap as beast&#8217;s: thou art a
lady;<br>
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br>
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear&#8217;st,<br>
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,&#8212;<br>
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br>
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br>
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!<br>
If it be you that stir these daughters&#8217; hearts<br>
Against their father, fool me not so much<br>
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br>
And let not women&#8217;s weapons, water-drops,<br>
Stain my man&#8217;s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,<br>
I will have such revenges on you both,<br>
That all the world shall&#8212;I will do such things,&#8212;<br>
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be<br>
The terrors of the earth. You think I&#8217;ll weep<br>
No, I&#8217;ll not weep:<br>
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart<br>
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,<br>
Or ere I&#8217;ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</p>

But, true it is, from France there comes a power<br>
Into this scatter&#8217;d kingdom; who already,<br>
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet<br>
In some of our best ports, and are at point<br>
To show their open banner. Now to you:<br>
If on my credit you dare build so far<br>
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find<br>
Some that will thank you, making just report<br>

I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;<br>

<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">I have been worth the whistle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">O Goneril!<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature, which contemns its origin,<br>
Cannot be border&#8217;d certain in itself;<br>
She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br>
From her material sap, perforce must wither<br>
And come to deadly use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">No more; the text is foolish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:<br>
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br>
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform&#8217;d?<br>
A father, and a gracious aged man,<br>
Whose reverence even the head-lugg&#8217;d bear would lick,<br>
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.<br>
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br>
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br>
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br>
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br>
It will come,<br>
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br>
Like monsters of the deep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Milk-liver&#8217;d man!<br>
That bear&#8217;st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br>
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br>
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know&#8217;st<br>
Fools do those villains pity who are punish&#8217;d<br>
Ere they have done their mischief. Where&#8217;s thy drum?<br>
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;<br>
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;<br>
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit&#8217;st still, and criest<br>
&#8216;Alack, why does he so?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">See thyself, devil!<br>
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br>
So horrid as in woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">O vain fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Thou changed and self-cover&#8217;d thing, for
shame,<br>
Be-monster not thy feature. Were&#8217;t my fitness<br>
To let these hands obey my blood,<br>
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br>
Thy flesh and bones: howe&#8217;er thou art a fiend,<br>
A woman&#8217;s shape doth shield thee.</p>

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall&#8217;s
dead:<br>
Slain by his servant, going to put out<br>
The other eye of Gloucester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">A servant that he bred, thrill&#8217;d with
remorse,<br>
Opposed against the act, bending his sword<br>
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,<br>
Flew on him, and amongst them fell&#8217;d him dead;<br>
But not without that harmful stroke, which since<br>
Hath pluck&#8217;d him after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">This shows you are above,<br>
You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br>
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!<br>
Lost he his other eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord; &#8217;twas he inform&#8217;d

And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br>
Might have the freer course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, I live<br>
To thank thee for the love thou show&#8217;dst the king,<br>

Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Why the King of France is so suddenly gone
back
know you the reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Something he left imperfect in the
state, which since his coming forth is thought
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger, that his personal return was
most required and necessary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Who hath he left behind him general?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my
presence;<br>
And now and then an ample tear trill&#8217;d down<br>
Her delicate cheek: it seem&#8217;d she was a queen<br>
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,<br>
Sought to be king o&#8217;er her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">O, then it moved her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove<br>
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br>
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears<br>
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,<br>
That play&#8217;d on her ripe lip, seem&#8217;d not to know<br>
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,<br>
As pearls from diamonds dropp&#8217;d. In brief,<br>
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,<br>
If all could so become it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Made she no verbal question?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, once or twice she heaved the name
of &#8216;father&#8217;<br>
Pantingly forth, as if it press&#8217;d her heart:<br>
Cried &#8216;sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!<br>
Kent! father! sisters! What, i&#8217; the storm? i&#8217; the
night?<br>
Let pity not be believed!&#8217; There she shook<br>
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,<br>
And clamour moisten&#8217;d: then away she started<br>
To deal with grief alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">It is the stars,<br>
The stars above us, govern our conditions;<br>
Else one self mate and mate could not beget<br>
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Was this before the king return&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No, since.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear&#8217;s
i&#8217; the town;<br>
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers<br>
What we are come about, and by no means<br>
Will yield to see his daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, good sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own
unkindness,<br>
That stripp&#8217;d her from his benediction, turn&#8217;d her<br>
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br>
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting<br>
His mind so venomously, that burning shame<br>
Detains him from Cordelia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, poor gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Of Albany&#8217;s and Cornwall&#8217;s powers you
heard not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so, they are afoot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I&#8217;ll bring you to our master
Lear,<br>
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause<br>
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;<br>
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve<br>
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go<br>

It was great ignorance, Gloucester&#8217;s eyes being out,<br>

My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk&#8217;d;<br>

If you do find him, pray you, give him this;<br>

I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.<br>

And dizzy &#8217;tis, to cast one&#8217;s eyes so low!<br>
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br>
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down<br>
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!<br>
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:<br>
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,<br>
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br>
Diminish&#8217;d to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br>
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,<br>
That on the unnumber&#8217;d idle pebbles chafes,<br>

cheese will do &#8217;t. There&#8217;s my gauntlet; I&#8217;ll

too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
found &#8217;em, there I smelt &#8217;em out. Go to, they are

Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:<br>
The wren goes to &#8217;t, and the small gilded fly<br>
Does lecher in my sight.<br>
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester&#8217;s bastard son<br>
Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br>
Got &#8217;tween the lawful sheets.<br>
To &#8217;t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br>
Behold yond simpering dame,<br>
Whose face between her forks presages snow;<br>
That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br>
To hear of pleasure&#8217;s name;<br>
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to &#8217;t<br>
With a more riotous appetite.<br>
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br>
Though women all above:<br>
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br>
Beneath is all the fiends&#8217;;<br>
There&#8217;s hell, there&#8217;s darkness, there&#8217;s the

<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>

with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which

Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;<br>
Thou hotly lust&#8217;st to use her in that kind<br>
For which thou whipp&#8217;st her. The usurer hangs the
cozener.<br>
Through tatter&#8217;d clothes small vices do appear;<br>
Robes and furr&#8217;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br>
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:<br>
Arm it in rags, a pigmy&#8217;s straw does pierce it.<br>
None does offend, none, I say, none; I&#8217;ll able &#8217;em:<br>
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br>
To seal the accuser&#8217;s lips. Get thee glass eyes;<br>

What is avouched there. If you miscarry,<br>
Your business of the world hath so an end,<br>

Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
If both remain alive: to take the widow<br>
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;<br>
And hardly shall I carry out my side,<br>
Her husband being alive. Now then we&#8217;ll use<br>
His countenance for the battle; which being done,<br>
Let her who would be rid of him devise<br>
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy<br>
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,<br>
The battle done, and they within our power,<br>
Shall never see his pardon; for my state<br>
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.</p>

Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;<br>
My reason all the same; and they are ready<br>
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear<br>
Where you shall hold your session. At this time<br>
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;<br>
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed<br>
By those that feel their sharpness:<br>
The question of Cordelia and her father<br>
Requires a fitter place.</p>

<p class="speech">The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Edmund is borne
off</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter King Lear, with
Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Captain, and others
following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of
stones:<br>
Had I your tongues and eyes, I&#8217;ld use them so<br>
That heaven&#8217;s vault should crack. She&#8217;s gone for
ever!<br>
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;<br>
She&#8217;s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;<br>
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br>
Why, then she lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the promised end</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Or image of that horror?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Fall, and cease!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,<br>
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows<br>
That ever I have felt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> O my good
master!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis noble Kent, your friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!<br>
I might have saved her; now she&#8217;s gone for ever!<br>
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!<br>
What is&#8217;t thou say&#8217;st? Her voice was ever soft,<br>
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.<br>
I kill&#8217;d the slave that was a-hanging thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, my lords, he did.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Did I not, fellow?<br>
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion<br>
I would have made them skip: I am old now,<br>
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?<br>
Mine eyes are not o&#8217; the best: I&#8217;ll tell you
straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,<br>
One of them we behold.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">The same,<br>
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a good fellow, I can tell you
that;<br>
He&#8217;ll strike, and quickly too: he&#8217;s dead and
rotten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; I am the very man,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see that straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">That, from your first of difference and
decay,<br>
Have follow&#8217;d your sad steps.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You are welcome hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Nor no man else: all&#8217;s cheerless, dark, and
deadly.<br>
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,<br>
And desperately are dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">He knows not what he says: and vain it is<br>
That we present us to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Very bootless.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Captain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Edmund is dead, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s but a trifle here.<br>
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.<br>
What comfort to this great decay may come<br>
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,<br>
During the life of this old majesty,<br>
To him our absolute power:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Edgar and Kent</span></p>
<p class="speech">you, to your rights:<br>
With boot, and such addition as your honours<br>
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste<br>
The wages of their virtue, and all foes<br>
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">And my poor fool is hang&#8217;d! No, no, no
life!<br>
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,<br>
And thou no breath at all? Thou&#8217;lt come no more,<br>
Never, never, never, never, never!<br>
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.<br>
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,<br>
Look there, look there!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">He faints! My lord, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Break, heart; I prithee, break!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Look up, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him
much<br>
That would upon the rack of this tough world<br>
Stretch him out longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">He is gone, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">The wonder is, he hath endured so long:<br>
He but usurp&#8217;d his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Bear them from hence. Our present business<br>
Is general woe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Kent and Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speech">Friends of my soul, you twain<br>
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;<br>
My master calls me, I must not say no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">The weight of this sad time we must obey;<br>
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.<br>
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young<br>
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt, with a dead
march</span></p>
