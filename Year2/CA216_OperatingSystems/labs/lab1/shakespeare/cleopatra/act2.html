<h4>Scene I. Messina. Pompey&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pompey, Menecrates, and
Menas, in warlike manner</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">If the great gods be just, they shall assist<br>
The deeds of justest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menecrates</p>
<p class="speech">Know, worthy Pompey,<br>
That what they do delay, they not deny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays<br>
The thing we sue for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menecrates</p>
<p class="speech">We, ignorant of ourselves,<br>
Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers<br>
Deny us for our good; so find we profit<br>
By losing of our prayers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I shall do well:<br>
The people love me, and the sea is mine;<br>
My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope<br>
Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony<br>
In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make<br>
No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where<br>
He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,<br>
Of both is flatter&#8217;d; but he neither loves,<br>
Nor either cares for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar and Lepidus<br>
Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Where have you this? &#8217;tis false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">From Silvius, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,<br>
Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,<br>
Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!<br>
Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!<br>
Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,<br>
Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks<br>
Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;<br>
That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour<br>
Even till a Lethe&#8217;d dulness!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Varrius</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Varrius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Varrius</p>
<p class="speech">This is most certain that I shall deliver:<br>
Mark Antony is every hour in Rome<br>
Expected: since he went from Egypt &#8217;tis<br>
A space for further travel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I could have given less matter<br>
A better ear. Menas, I did not think<br>
This amorous surfeiter would have donn&#8217;d his helm<br>
For such a petty war: his soldiership<br>
Is twice the other twain: but let us rear<br>
The higher our opinion, that our stirring<br>
Can from the lap of Egypt&#8217;s widow pluck<br>
The ne&#8217;er-lust-wearied Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot hope<br>
Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:<br>
His wife that&#8217;s dead did trespasses to Caesar;<br>
His brother warr&#8217;d upon him; although, I think,<br>
Not moved by Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I know not, Menas,<br>
How lesser enmities may give way to greater.<br>
Were&#8217;t not that we stand up against them all,<br>
&#8217;Twere pregnant they should square between
themselves;<br>
For they have entertained cause enough<br>
To draw their swords: but how the fear of us<br>
May cement their divisions and bind up<br>
The petty difference, we yet not know.<br>
Be&#8217;t as our gods will have&#8217;t! It only stands<br>
Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.<br>
Come, Menas.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Rome. The house of Lepidus.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Domitius Enobarbus and
Lepidus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Good Enobarbus, &#8217;tis a worthy deed,<br>
And shall become you well, to entreat your captain<br>
To soft and gentle speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I shall entreat him<br>
To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,<br>
Let Antony look over Caesar&#8217;s head<br>
And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,<br>
Were I the wearer of Antonius&#8217; beard,<br>
I would not shave&#8217;t to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not a time<br>
For private stomaching.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Every time<br>
Serves for the matter that is then born in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">But small to greater matters must give way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Not if the small come first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Your speech is passion:<br>
But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes<br>
The noble Antony.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mark Antony and
Ventidius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And yonder, Caesar.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Octavius Caesar,
Mecaenas, and Agrippa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">If we compose well here, to Parthia:<br>
Hark, Ventidius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I do not know,<br>
Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Noble friends,<br>
That which combined us was most great, and let not<br>
A leaner action rend us. What&#8217;s amiss,<br>
May it be gently heard: when we debate<br>
Our trivial difference loud, we do commit<br>
Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,<br>
The rather, for I earnestly beseech,<br>
Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,<br>
Nor curstness grow to the matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis spoken well.<br>
Were we before our armies, and to fight.<br>
I should do thus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome to Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thank you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Sit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Sit, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I learn, you take things ill which are not
so,<br>
Or being, concern you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I must be laugh&#8217;d at,<br>
If, or for nothing or a little, I<br>
Should say myself offended, and with you<br>
Chiefly i&#8217; the world; more laugh&#8217;d at, that I
should<br>
Once name you derogately, when to sound your name<br>
It not concern&#8217;d me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">My being in Egypt, Caesar,<br>
What was&#8217;t to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">No more than my residing here at Rome<br>
Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there<br>
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt<br>
Might be my question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How intend you, practised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You may be pleased to catch at mine intent<br>
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother<br>
Made wars upon me; and their contestation<br>
Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You do mistake your business; my brother
never<br>
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;<br>
And have my learning from some true reports,<br>
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather<br>
Discredit my authority with yours;<br>
And make the wars alike against my stomach,<br>
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters<br>
Before did satisfy you. If you&#8217;ll patch a quarrel,<br>
As matter whole you have not to make it with,<br>
It must not be with this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You praise yourself<br>
By laying defects of judgment to me; but<br>
You patch&#8217;d up your excuses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, not so;<br>
I know you could not lack, I am certain on&#8217;t,<br>
Very necessity of this thought, that I,<br>
Your partner in the cause &#8217;gainst which he fought,<br>
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars<br>
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,<br>
I would you had her spirit in such another:<br>
The third o&#8217; the world is yours; which with a snaffle<br>
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Would we had all such wives, that the men might
go
to wars with the women!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar<br>
Made out of her impatience, which not wanted<br>
Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant<br>
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must<br>
But say, I could not help it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I wrote to you<br>
When rioting in Alexandria; you<br>
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts<br>
Did gibe my missive out of audience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
He fell upon me ere admitted: then<br>
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want<br>
Of what I was i&#8217; the morning: but next day<br>
I told him of myself; which was as much<br>
As to have ask&#8217;d him pardon. Let this fellow<br>
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,<br>
Out of our question wipe him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You have broken<br>
The article of your oath; which you shall never<br>
Have tongue to charge me with.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Soft, Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">No,<br>
Lepidus, let him speak:<br>
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,<br>
Supposing that I lack&#8217;d it. But, on, Caesar;<br>
The article of my oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">To lend me arms and aid when I required them;<br>
The which you both denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Neglected, rather;<br>
And then when poison&#8217;d hours had bound me up<br>
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,<br>
I&#8217;ll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty<br>
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power<br>
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,<br>
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;<br>
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do<br>
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour<br>
To stoop in such a case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis noble spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">If it might please you, to enforce no further<br>
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite<br>
Were to remember that the present need<br>
Speaks to atone you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Or, if you borrow one another&#8217;s love for
the
instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">That truth should be silent I had almost
forgot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong this presence; therefore speak no
more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, then; your considerate stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I do not much dislike the matter, but<br>
The manner of his speech; for&#8217;t cannot be<br>
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions<br>
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew<br>
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge<br>
O&#8217; the world I would pursue it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Give me leave, Caesar,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, Agrippa.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast a sister by the mother&#8217;s
side,<br>
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony<br>
Is now a widower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Say not so, Agrippa:<br>
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof<br>
Were well deserved of rashness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I am not married, Caesar: let me hear<br>
Agrippa further speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">To hold you in perpetual amity,<br>
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts<br>
With an unslipping knot, take Antony<br>
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims<br>
No worse a husband than the best of men;<br>
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak<br>
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,<br>
All little jealousies, which now seem great,<br>
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,<br>
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,<br>
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both<br>
Would, each to other and all loves to both,<br>
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;<br>
For &#8217;tis a studied, not a present thought,<br>
By duty ruminated.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Will Caesar speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Not till he hears how Antony is touch&#8217;d<br>
With what is spoke already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">What power is in Agrippa,<br>
If I would say, &#8216;Agrippa, be it so,&#8217;<br>
To make this good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The power of Caesar, and<br>
His power unto Octavia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">May I never<br>
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,<br>
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:<br>
Further this act of grace: and from this hour<br>
The heart of brothers govern in our loves<br>
And sway our great designs!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">There is my hand.<br>
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother<br>
Did ever love so dearly: let her live<br>
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never<br>
Fly off our loves again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Happily, amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I did not think to draw my sword &#8217;gainst
Pompey;<br>
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great<br>
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,<br>
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;<br>
At heel of that, defy him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Time calls upon&#8217;s:<br>
Of us must Pompey presently be sought,<br>
Or else he seeks out us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Where lies he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">About the mount Misenum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">What is his strength by land?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Great and increasing: but by sea<br>
He is an absolute master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">So is the fame.<br>
Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:<br>
Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we<br>
The business we have talk&#8217;d of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">With most gladness:<br>
And do invite you to my sister&#8217;s view,<br>
Whither straight I&#8217;ll lead you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let us, Lepidus,<br>
Not lack your company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Antony,<br>
Not sickness should detain me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt Octavius
Caesar, Mark Antony, and Lepidus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome from Egypt, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
honourable friend, Agrippa!</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Good Enobarbus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">We have cause to be glad that matters are so
well
digested. You stayed well by &#8217;t in Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance,
and
made the night light with drinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast,
and
but twelve persons there; is this true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much
more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a most triumphant lady, if report be
square to
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">There she appeared indeed; or my reporter
devised
well for her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you.<br>
The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#8217;d throne,<br>
Burn&#8217;d on the water: the poop was beaten gold;<br>
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<br>
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<br>
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br>
The water which they beat to follow faster,<br>
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<br>
It beggar&#8217;d all description: she did lie<br>
In her pavilion&#8212;cloth-of-gold of tissue&#8212;<br>
O&#8217;er-picturing that Venus where we see<br>
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her<br>
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<br>
With divers-colour&#8217;d fans, whose wind did seem<br>
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<br>
And what they undid did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">O, rare for Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<br>
So many mermaids, tended her i&#8217; the eyes,<br>
And made their bends adornings: at the helm<br>
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle<br>
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,<br>
That yarely frame the office. From the barge<br>
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br>
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<br>
Her people out upon her; and Antony,<br>
Enthroned i&#8217; the market-place, did sit alone,<br>
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,<br>
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<br>
And made a gap in nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Rare Egyptian!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<br>
Invited her to supper: she replied,<br>
It should be better he became her guest;<br>
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,<br>
Whom ne&#8217;er the word of &#8216;No&#8217; woman heard
speak,<br>
Being barber&#8217;d ten times o&#8217;er, goes to the feast,<br>
And for his ordinary pays his heart<br>
For what his eyes eat only.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Royal wench!<br>
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:<br>
He plough&#8217;d her, and she cropp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I saw her once<br>
Hop forty paces through the public street;<br>
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,<br>
That she did make defect perfection,<br>
And, breathless, power breathe forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Now Antony must leave her utterly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Never; he will not:<br>
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale<br>
Her infinite variety: other women cloy<br>
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry<br>
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things<br>
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests<br>
Bless her when she is riggish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle<br>
The heart of Antony, Octavia is<br>
A blessed lottery to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Let us go.<br>
Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest<br>
Whilst you abide here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>

Thither!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">If you can, your reason?</p>

<p class="speech">I see it in<br>
My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet<br>
Hie you to Egypt again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>

Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar&#8217;s or mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar&#8217;s.<br>
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:<br>
Thy demon, that&#8217;s thy spirit which keeps thee, is<br>
Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,<br>
Where Caesar&#8217;s is not; but, near him, thy angel<br>
Becomes a fear, as being o&#8217;erpower&#8217;d: therefore<br>
Make space enough between you.</p>

If thou dost play with him at any game,<br>
Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,<br>
He beats thee &#8217;gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,<br>
When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit<br>
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;<br>
But, he away, &#8217;tis noble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>

Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Soothsayer</span></p>
<p class="speech">He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,<br>
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;<br>
And in our sports my better cunning faints<br>
Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;<br>
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,<br>
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever<br>
Beat mine, inhoop&#8217;d, at odds. I will to Egypt:<br>
And though I make this marriage for my peace,<br>
I&#8217; the east my pleasure lies.</p>

But there&#8217;s no goodness in thy face: if Antony<br>

Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown&#8217;d with snakes,<br>
Not like a formal man.</p>

<p class="speech">We came hither to fight with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a
drinking.<br>
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">If he do, sure, he cannot weep&#8217;t back
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ve said, sir. We looked not for Mark
Antony
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar&#8217;s sister is called Octavia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">True, sir; she was the wife of Caius
Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Pray ye, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">If I were bound to divine of this unity, I
would
not prophesy so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">I think the policy of that purpose made more in
the
marriage than the love of the parties.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I think so too. But you shall find, the band
that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Who would not have his wife so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark
Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you
aboard?<br>
I have a health for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in
Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let&#8217;s away.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music plays. Enter two or
three Servants with a banquet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Here they&#8217;ll be, man. Some o&#8217; their
plants are
ill-rooted already: the least wind i&#8217; the world
will blow them down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Lepidus is high-coloured.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">They have made him drink alms-drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">As they pinch one another by the disposition,
he
cries out &#8216;No more;&#8217; reconciles them to his
entreaty, and himself to the drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">But it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is to have a name in great
men&#8217;s
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be
seen
to move in&#8217;t, are the holes where eyes should be,
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A sennet sounded. Enter
Octavius Caesar, Mark Antony, Lepidus, Pompey, Agrippa, Mecaenas,
Domitius Enobarbus, Menas, with other captains</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Octavius Caesar]</span>
Thus do they, sir: they take
the flow o&#8217; the Nile<br>
By certain scales i&#8217; the pyramid; they know,<br>
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth<br>
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,<br>
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman<br>
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,<br>
And shortly comes to harvest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ve strange serpents there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Lepidus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by
the
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">They are so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sit,&#8212;and some wine! A health to
Lepidus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">I am not so well as I should be, but I&#8217;ll
ne&#8217;er out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Not till you have slept; I fear me you&#8217;ll
be in till then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, certainly, I have heard the
Ptolemies&#8217;
pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction, I have heard that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Pompey]</span>
Pompey, a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Menas]</span> Say
in mine ear:
what is&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>

thee, captain,<br>
And hear me speak a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>

Forbear me till anon.<br>
This wine for Lepidus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">What manner o&#8217; thing is your crocodile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as
broad
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
it, it transmigrates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">What colour is it of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Of it own colour too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a strange serpent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Will this description satisfy him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is
a
very epicure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Menas]</span> Go
hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
that? away!
Do as I bid you. Where&#8217;s this cup I call&#8217;d for?</p>

<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast served me with much faith. What&#8217;s
else to say?<br>
Be jolly, lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;These quick-sands, Lepidus,<br>
Keep off them, for you sink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>

<p class="speech">How should that be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">But entertain it,<br>

<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou drunk well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.<br>
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:<br>
Whate&#8217;er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,<br>
Is thine, if thou wilt ha&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Show me which way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">These three world-sharers, these competitors,<br>
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;<br>
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:<br>
All there is thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, this thou shouldst have done,<br>
And not have spoke on&#8217;t! In me &#8217;tis villany;<br>
In thee&#8217;t had been good service. Thou must know,<br>
&#8217;Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;<br>
Mine honour, it. Repent that e&#8217;er thy tongue<br>
Hath so betray&#8217;d thine act: being done unknown,<br>
I should have found it afterwards well done;<br>
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> For this,<br>
I&#8217;ll never follow thy pall&#8217;d fortunes more.<br>

<p class="speech">This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?<br>
Here is to Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I could well forbear&#8217;t.<br>
It&#8217;s monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,<br>

<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Possess it, I&#8217;ll make answer:<br>

<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let&#8217;s all take hands,<br>
Till that the conquering wine hath steep&#8217;d our sense<br>
In soft and delicate Lethe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">All take hands.<br>
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:<br>
The while I&#8217;ll place you: then the boy shall sing;<br>

As his strong sides can volley.</p>

brother,<br>
Let me request you off: our graver business<br>
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let&#8217;s part;<br>
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb<br>
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue<br>
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost<br>
Antick&#8217;d us all. What needs more words? Good night.<br>
Good Antony, your hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll try you on the shore.</p>
