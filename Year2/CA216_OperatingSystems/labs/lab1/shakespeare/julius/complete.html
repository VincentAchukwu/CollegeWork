<h3>ACT I</h3>
<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title="Scene I. Rome. A street.">
<h4>Scene I. Rome. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Flavius, Marullus, and
certain Commoners</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:<br>
Is this a holiday? what! know you not,<br>
Being mechanical, you ought not walk<br>
Upon a labouring day without the sign<br>
Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, a carpenter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?<br>
What dost thou with thy best apparel on?<br>
You, sir, what trade are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am
but,
as you would say, a cobbler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">But what trade art thou? answer me directly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a
safe
conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what
trade?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me:
yet,
if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy
fellow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, cobble you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl:
I
meddle with no tradesman&#8217;s matters, nor women&#8217;s
matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
neat&#8217;s leather have gone upon my handiwork.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">But wherefore art not in thy shop today?<br>
Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Commoner</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get
myself
into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he
home?<br>
What tributaries follow him to Rome,<br>
To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?<br>
You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!<br>
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,<br>
Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft<br>
Have you climb&#8217;d up to walls and battlements,<br>
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,<br>
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat<br>
The livelong day, with patient expectation,<br>
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:<br>
And when you saw his chariot but appear,<br>
Have you not made an universal shout,<br>
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,<br>
To hear the replication of your sounds<br>
Made in her concave shores?<br>
And do you now put on your best attire?<br>
And do you now cull out a holiday?<br>
And do you now strew flowers in his way<br>
That comes in triumph over Pompey&#8217;s blood? Be gone!<br>
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,<br>
Pray to the gods to intermit the plague<br>
That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,<br>
Assemble all the poor men of your sort;<br>
Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears<br>
Into the channel, till the lowest stream<br>
Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all the
Commoners</span></p>
<p class="speech">See whether their basest metal be not moved;<br>
They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.<br>
Go you down that way towards the Capitol;<br>
This way will I disrobe the images,<br>
If you do find them deck&#8217;d with ceremonies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marullus</p>
<p class="speech">May we do so?<br>
You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">It is no matter; let no images<br>
Be hung with Caesar&#8217;s trophies. I&#8217;ll about,<br>
And drive away the vulgar from the streets:<br>
So do you too, where you perceive them thick.<br>
These growing feathers pluck&#8217;d from Caesar&#8217;s wing<br>
Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,<br>
Who else would soar above the view of men<br>
And keep us all in servile fearfulness.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter Caesar;
Antony, for the course; Calpurnia, Portia, Decius Brutus, Cicero,
Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd following, among them a
Soothsayer</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Calpurnia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Calpurnia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Calpurnia</p>
<p class="speech">Here, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Stand you directly in Antonius&#8217; way,<br>
When he doth run his course. Antonius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,<br>
To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,<br>
The barren, touched in this holy chase,<br>
Shake off their sterile curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I shall remember:<br>
When Caesar says &#8216;do this,&#8217; it is perform&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! who calls?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Who is it in the press that calls on me?<br>
I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,<br>
Cry &#8216;Caesar!&#8217; Speak; Caesar is turn&#8217;d to
hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Beware the ides of March.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What man is that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of
March.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Set him before me; let me see his face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow, come from the throng; look upon
Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou to me now? speak once
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Beware the ides of March.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Exeunt all except
Brutus and Cassius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Will you go see the order of the course?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I am not gamesome: I do lack some part<br>
Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.<br>
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;<br>
I&#8217;ll leave you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Brutus, I do observe you now of late:<br>
I have not from your eyes that gentleness<br>
And show of love as I was wont to have:<br>
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand<br>
Over your friend that loves you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Cassius,<br>
Be not deceived: if I have veil&#8217;d my look,<br>
I turn the trouble of my countenance<br>
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am<br>
Of late with passions of some difference,<br>
Conceptions only proper to myself,<br>
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;<br>
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved&#8212;<br>
Among which number, Cassius, be you one&#8212;<br>
Nor construe any further my neglect,<br>
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,<br>
Forgets the shows of love to other men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your
passion;<br>
By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried<br>
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.<br>
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,<br>
But by reflection, by some other things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis just:<br>
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,<br>
That you have no such mirrors as will turn<br>
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,<br>
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,<br>
Where many of the best respect in Rome,<br>
Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus<br>
And groaning underneath this age&#8217;s yoke,<br>
Have wish&#8217;d that noble Brutus had his eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,<br>
That you would have me seek into myself<br>
For that which is not in me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:<br>
And since you know you cannot see yourself<br>
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,<br>
Will modestly discover to yourself<br>
That of yourself which you yet know not of.<br>
And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:<br>
Were I a common laugher, or did use<br>
To stale with ordinary oaths my love<br>
To every new protester; if you know<br>
That I do fawn on men and hug them hard<br>
And after scandal them, or if you know<br>
That I profess myself in banqueting<br>
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish, and
shout</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What means this shouting? I do fear, the
people<br>
Choose Caesar for their king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, do you fear it?<br>
Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.<br>
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?<br>
What is it that you would impart to me?<br>
If it be aught toward the general good,<br>
Set honour in one eye and death i&#8217; the other,<br>
And I will look on both indifferently,<br>
For let the gods so speed me as I love<br>
The name of honour more than I fear death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,<br>
As well as I do know your outward favour.<br>
Well, honour is the subject of my story.<br>
I cannot tell what you and other men<br>
Think of this life; but, for my single self,<br>
I had as lief not be as live to be<br>
In awe of such a thing as I myself.<br>
I was born free as Caesar; so were you:<br>
We both have fed as well, and we can both<br>
Endure the winter&#8217;s cold as well as he:<br>
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,<br>
The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,<br>
Caesar said to me &#8216;Darest thou, Cassius, now<br>
Leap in with me into this angry flood,<br>
And swim to yonder point?&#8217; Upon the word,<br>
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in<br>
And bade him follow; so indeed he did.<br>
The torrent roar&#8217;d, and we did buffet it<br>
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside<br>
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;<br>
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,<br>
Caesar cried &#8216;Help me, Cassius, or I sink!&#8217;<br>
I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,<br>
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder<br>
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber<br>
Did I the tired Caesar. And this man<br>
Is now become a god, and Cassius is<br>
A wretched creature and must bend his body,<br>
If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.<br>
He had a fever when he was in Spain,<br>
And when the fit was on him, I did mark<br>
How he did shake: &#8217;tis true, this god did shake;<br>
His coward lips did from their colour fly,<br>
And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world<br>
Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:<br>
Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans<br>
Mark him and write his speeches in their books,<br>
Alas, it cried &#8216;Give me some drink, Titinius,&#8217;<br>
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me<br>
A man of such a feeble temper should<br>
So get the start of the majestic world<br>
And bear the palm alone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Shout. Flourish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Another general shout!<br>
I do believe that these applauses are<br>
For some new honours that are heap&#8217;d on Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world<br>
Like a Colossus, and we petty men<br>
Walk under his huge legs and peep about<br>
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.<br>
Men at some time are masters of their fates:<br>
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br>
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br>
Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that &#8216;Caesar&#8217;?<br>
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?<br>
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;<br>
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;<br>
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with &#8217;em,<br>
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.<br>
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,<br>
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,<br>
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!<br>
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!<br>
When went there by an age, since the great flood,<br>
But it was famed with more than with one man?<br>
When could they say till now, that talk&#8217;d of Rome,<br>
That her wide walls encompass&#8217;d but one man?<br>
Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,<br>
When there is in it but one only man.<br>
O, you and I have heard our fathers say,<br>
There was a Brutus once that would have brook&#8217;d<br>
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome<br>
As easily as a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;<br>
What you would work me to, I have some aim:<br>
How I have thought of this and of these times,<br>
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,<br>
I would not, so with love I might entreat you,<br>
Be any further moved. What you have said<br>
I will consider; what you have to say<br>
I will with patience hear, and find a time<br>
Both meet to hear and answer such high things.<br>
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:<br>
Brutus had rather be a villager<br>
Than to repute himself a son of Rome<br>
Under these hard conditions as this time<br>
Is like to lay upon us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad that my weak words<br>
Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The games are done and Caesar is returning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;<br>
And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you<br>
What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Caesar and his
Train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,<br>
The angry spot doth glow on Caesar&#8217;s brow,<br>
And all the rest look like a chidden train:<br>
Calpurnia&#8217;s cheek is pale; and Cicero<br>
Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes<br>
As we have seen him in the Capitol,<br>
Being cross&#8217;d in conference by some senators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Antonius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Let me have men about me that are fat;<br>
Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o&#8217; nights:<br>
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;<br>
He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fear him not, Caesar; he&#8217;s not
dangerous;<br>
He is a noble Roman and well given.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:<br>
Yet if my name were liable to fear,<br>
I do not know the man I should avoid<br>
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;<br>
He is a great observer and he looks<br>
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,<br>
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;<br>
Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort<br>
As if he mock&#8217;d himself and scorn&#8217;d his spirit<br>
That could be moved to smile at any thing.<br>
Such men as he be never at heart&#8217;s ease<br>
Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,<br>
And therefore are they very dangerous.<br>
I rather tell thee what is to be fear&#8217;d<br>
Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.<br>
Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,<br>
And tell me truly what thou think&#8217;st of him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all
his Train, but Casca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">You pull&#8217;d me by the cloak; would you speak
with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,<br>
That Caesar looks so sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What was the second noise for?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, for that too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">They shouted thrice: what was the last cry
for?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, for that too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, was&#8217;t, and he put it by thrice,
every
time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
mine honest neighbours shouted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Who offered him the crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of
it:
it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
Antony offer him a crown;&#8212;yet &#8217;twas not a crown
neither, &#8217;twas one of these coronets;&#8212;and, as I
told
you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar
swound?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">He fell down in the market-place, and foamed
at
mouth, and was speechless.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very like: he hath the failing
sickness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,<br>
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what you mean by that; but, I am
sure,
Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
displeased them, as they use to do the players in
the theatre, I am no true man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What said he when he came unto himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived
the
common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
or four wenches, where I stood, cried &#8216;Alas, good
soul!&#8217; and forgave him with all their hearts: but
there&#8217;s no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Did Cicero say any thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">To what effect?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne&#8217;er look you
i&#8217; the
face again: but those that understood him smiled at
one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
off Caesar&#8217;s images, are put to silence. Fare you
well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
remember it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">No, I am promised forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Will you dine with me to-morrow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your
dinner
worth the eating.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Good: I will expect you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Do so. Farewell, both.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!<br>
He was quick mettle when he went to school.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">So is he now in execution<br>
Of any bold or noble enterprise,<br>
However he puts on this tardy form.<br>
This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,<br>
Which gives men stomach to digest his words<br>
With better appetite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">And so it is. For this time I will leave you:<br>
To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,<br>
I will come home to you; or, if you will,<br>
Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I will do so: till then, think of the world.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,<br>
Thy honourable metal may be wrought<br>
From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet<br>
That noble minds keep ever with their likes;<br>
For who so firm that cannot be seduced?<br>
Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:<br>
If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,<br>
He should not humour me. I will this night,<br>
In several hands, in at his windows throw,<br>
As if they came from several citizens,<br>
Writings all tending to the great opinion<br>
That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely<br>
Caesar&#8217;s ambition shall be glanced at:<br>
And after this let Caesar seat him sure;<br>
For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The same. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Thunder and lightning. Enter
from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and
Cicero</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cicero</p>
<p class="speech">Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?<br>
Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth<br>
Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,<br>
I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds<br>
Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen<br>
The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,<br>
To be exalted with the threatening clouds:<br>
But never till to-night, never till now,<br>
Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.<br>
Either there is a civil strife in heaven,<br>
Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,<br>
Incenses them to send destruction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cicero</p>
<p class="speech">Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">A common slave&#8212;you know him well by
sight&#8212;<br>
Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn<br>
Like twenty torches join&#8217;d, and yet his hand,<br>
Not sensible of fire, remain&#8217;d unscorch&#8217;d.<br>
Besides&#8212;I ha&#8217; not since put up my sword&#8212;<br>
Against the Capitol I met a lion,<br>
Who glared upon me, and went surly by,<br>
Without annoying me: and there were drawn<br>
Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,<br>
Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw<br>
Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.<br>
And yesterday the bird of night did sit<br>
Even at noon-day upon the market-place,<br>
Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies<br>
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say<br>
&#8216;These are their reasons; they are natural;&#8217;<br>
For, I believe, they are portentous things<br>
Unto the climate that they point upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cicero</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:<br>
But men may construe things after their fashion,<br>
Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.<br>
Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">He doth; for he did bid Antonius<br>
Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cicero</p>
<p class="speech">Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky<br>
Is not to walk in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, Cicero.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Cicero</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A Roman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Casca, by your voice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is
this!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">A very pleasing night to honest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Those that have known the earth so full of
faults.<br>
For my part, I have walk&#8217;d about the streets,<br>
Submitting me unto the perilous night,<br>
And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,<br>
Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;<br>
And when the cross blue lightning seem&#8217;d to open<br>
The breast of heaven, I did present myself<br>
Even in the aim and very flash of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">But wherefore did you so much tempt the
heavens?<br>
It is the part of men to fear and tremble,<br>
When the most mighty gods by tokens send<br>
Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life<br>
That should be in a Roman you do want,<br>
Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze<br>
And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,<br>
To see the strange impatience of the heavens:<br>
But if you would consider the true cause<br>
Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,<br>
Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,<br>
Why old men fool and children calculate,<br>
Why all these things change from their ordinance<br>
Their natures and preformed faculties<br>
To monstrous quality,&#8212;why, you shall find<br>
That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,<br>
To make them instruments of fear and warning<br>
Unto some monstrous state.<br>
Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man<br>
Most like this dreadful night,<br>
That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars<br>
As doth the lion in the Capitol,<br>
A man no mightier than thyself or me<br>
In personal action, yet prodigious grown<br>
And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not,
Cassius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be who it is: for Romans now<br>
Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;<br>
But, woe the while! our fathers&#8217; minds are dead,<br>
And we are govern&#8217;d with our mothers&#8217; spirits;<br>
Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow<br>
Mean to establish Caesar as a king;<br>
And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,<br>
In every place, save here in Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I know where I will wear this dagger then;<br>
Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:<br>
Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;<br>
Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:<br>
Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,<br>
Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,<br>
Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;<br>
But life, being weary of these worldly bars,<br>
Never lacks power to dismiss itself.<br>
If I know this, know all the world besides,<br>
That part of tyranny that I do bear<br>
I can shake off at pleasure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Thunder still</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">So can I:<br>
So every bondman in his own hand bears<br>
The power to cancel his captivity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?<br>
Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,<br>
But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:<br>
He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.<br>
Those that with haste will make a mighty fire<br>
Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,<br>
What rubbish and what offal, when it serves<br>
For the base matter to illuminate<br>
So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,<br>
Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this<br>
Before a willing bondman; then I know<br>
My answer must be made. But I am arm&#8217;d,<br>
And dangers are to me indifferent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">You speak to Casca, and to such a man<br>
That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:<br>
Be factious for redress of all these griefs,<br>
And I will set this foot of mine as far<br>
As who goes farthest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s a bargain made.<br>
Now know you, Casca, I have moved already<br>
Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans<br>
To undergo with me an enterprise<br>
Of honourable-dangerous consequence;<br>
And I do know, by this, they stay for me<br>
In Pompey&#8217;s porch: for now, this fearful night,<br>
There is no stir or walking in the streets;<br>
And the complexion of the element<br>
In favour&#8217;s like the work we have in hand,<br>
Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Stand close awhile, for here comes one in
haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;<br>
He is a friend.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cinna</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cinna, where haste you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">To find out you. Who&#8217;s that? Metellus
Cimber?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">No, it is Casca; one incorporate<br>
To our attempts. Am I not stay&#8217;d for, Cinna?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad on &#8217;t. What a fearful night is
this!<br>
There&#8217;s two or three of us have seen strange sights.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not stay&#8217;d for? tell me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, you are.<br>
O Cassius, if you could<br>
But win the noble Brutus to our party&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,<br>
And look you lay it in the praetor&#8217;s chair,<br>
Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this<br>
In at his window; set this up with wax<br>
Upon old Brutus&#8217; statue: all this done,<br>
Repair to Pompey&#8217;s porch, where you shall find us.<br>
Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">All but Metellus Cimber; and he&#8217;s gone<br>
To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,<br>
And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">That done, repair to Pompey&#8217;s theatre.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Cinna</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day<br>
See Brutus at his house: three parts of him<br>
Is ours already, and the man entire<br>
Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">O, he sits high in all the people&#8217;s
hearts:<br>
And that which would appear offence in us,<br>
His countenance, like richest alchemy,<br>
Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Him and his worth and our great need of him<br>
You have right well conceited. Let us go,<br>
For it is after midnight; and ere day<br>
We will awake him and be sure of him.</p>

It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;<br>
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?&#8212;that;&#8212;<br>
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,<br>
That at his will he may do danger with.<br>
The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins<br>
Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,<br>
I have not known when his affections sway&#8217;d<br>
More than his reason. But &#8217;tis a common proof,<br>
That lowliness is young ambition&#8217;s ladder,<br>
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;<br>
But when he once attains the upmost round.<br>
He then unto the ladder turns his back,<br>
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees<br>
By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.<br>
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel<br>
Will bear no colour for the thing he is,<br>
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,<br>
Would run to these and these extremities:<br>

When evils are most free? O, then by day<br>
Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough<br>
To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;<br>
Hide it in smiles and affability:<br>
For if thou path, thy native semblance on,<br>
Not Erebus itself were dim enough<br>
To hide thee from prevention.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the conspirators,
Cassius, Casca, Decius Brutus, Cinna, Metellus Cimber, and
Trebonius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I think we are too bold upon your rest:<br>
Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I have been up this hour, awake all night.<br>
Know I these men that come along with you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, every man of them, and no man here<br>
But honours you; and every one doth wish<br>
You had but that opinion of yourself<br>
Which every noble Roman bears of you.<br>
This is Trebonius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He is welcome hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">This, Decius Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He is welcome too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus
Cimber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">They are all welcome.<br>
What watchful cares do interpose themselves<br>
Betwixt your eyes and night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I entreat a word?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Brutus and Cassius
whisper</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Here lies the east: doth not the day break
here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines<br>
That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">You shall confess that you are both deceived.<br>
Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,<br>
Which is a great way growing on the south,<br>
Weighing the youthful season of the year.<br>
Some two months hence up higher toward the north<br>
He first presents his fire; and the high east<br>
Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hands all over, one by one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">And let us swear our resolution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No, not an oath: if not the face of men,<br>
The sufferance of our souls, the time&#8217;s abuse,&#8212;<br>
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,<br>
And every man hence to his idle bed;<br>
So let high-sighted tyranny range on,<br>
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,<br>
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough<br>
To kindle cowards and to steel with valour<br>
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,<br>
What need we any spur but our own cause,<br>
To prick us to redress? what other bond<br>
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,<br>
And will not palter? and what other oath<br>
Than honesty to honesty engaged,<br>
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?<br>
Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,<br>
Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls<br>
That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear<br>
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain<br>
The even virtue of our enterprise,<br>
Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,<br>
To think that or our cause or our performance<br>
Did need an oath; when every drop of blood<br>
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,<br>
Is guilty of a several bastardy,<br>
If he do break the smallest particle<br>
Of any promise that hath pass&#8217;d from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?<br>
I think he will stand very strong with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Let us not leave him out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">No, by no means.</p>
<p class="speaker">Metellus Cimber</p>
<p class="speech">O, let us have him, for his silver hairs<br>
Will purchase us a good opinion<br>
And buy men&#8217;s voices to commend our deeds:<br>
It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;<br>
Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,<br>
But all be buried in his gravity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O, name him not: let us not break with him;<br>
For he will never follow any thing<br>
That other men begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Then leave him out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed he is not fit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Shall no man else be touch&#8217;d but only
Caesar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,<br>
Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,<br>
Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him<br>
A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,<br>
If he improve them, may well stretch so far<br>
As to annoy us all: which to prevent,<br>
Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Our course will seem too bloody, Caius
Cassius,<br>
To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,<br>
Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;<br>
For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:<br>
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.<br>
We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;<br>
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:<br>
O, that we then could come by Caesar&#8217;s spirit,<br>
And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,<br>
Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,<br>
Let&#8217;s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;<br>
Let&#8217;s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,<br>
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:<br>
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,<br>
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,<br>
And after seem to chide &#8217;em. This shall make<br>
Our purpose necessary and not envious:<br>
Which so appearing to the common eyes,<br>
We shall be call&#8217;d purgers, not murderers.<br>
And for Mark Antony, think not of him;<br>
For he can do no more than Caesar&#8217;s arm<br>
When Caesar&#8217;s head is off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Yet I fear him;<br>
For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:<br>
If he love Caesar, all that he can do<br>
Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:<br>
And that were much he should; for he is given<br>
To sports, to wildness and much company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trebonius</p>
<p class="speech">There is no fear in him; let him not die;<br>
For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clock strikes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! count the clock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">The clock hath stricken three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trebonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis time to part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But it is doubtful yet,<br>
Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;<br>
For he is superstitious grown of late,<br>
Quite from the main opinion he held once<br>
Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:<br>
It may be, these apparent prodigies,<br>
The unaccustom&#8217;d terror of this night,<br>
And the persuasion of his augurers,<br>
May hold him from the Capitol to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Never fear that: if he be so resolved,<br>
I can o&#8217;ersway him; for he loves to hear<br>
That unicorns may be betray&#8217;d with trees,<br>
And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,<br>
Lions with toils and men with flatterers;<br>
But when I tell him he hates flatterers,<br>
He says he does, being then most flattered.<br>
Let me work;<br>
For I can give his humour the true bent,<br>
And I will bring him to the Capitol.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Metellus Cimber</p>
<p class="speech">Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,<br>
Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:<br>
I wonder none of you have thought of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, good Metellus, go along by him:<br>
He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;<br>
Send him but hither, and I&#8217;ll fashion him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">The morning comes upon &#8217;s: we&#8217;ll
leave you, Brutus.<br>
And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember<br>
What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;<br>
Let not our looks put on our purposes,<br>
But bear it as our Roman actors do,<br>
With untired spirits and formal constancy:<br>
And so good morrow to you every one.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;<br>
Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:<br>
Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,<br>
Which busy care draws in the brains of men;<br>
Therefore thou sleep&#8217;st so sound.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Portia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Brutus, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you
now?<br>
It is not for your health thus to commit<br>
Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Nor for yours neither. You&#8217;ve ungently,
Brutus,<br>
Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,<br>
You suddenly arose, and walk&#8217;d about,<br>
Musing and sighing, with your arms across,<br>
And when I ask&#8217;d you what the matter was,<br>
You stared upon me with ungentle looks;<br>
I urged you further; then you scratch&#8217;d your head,<br>
And too impatiently stamp&#8217;d with your foot;<br>
Yet I insisted, yet you answer&#8217;d not,<br>
But, with an angry wafture of your hand,<br>
Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;<br>
Fearing to strengthen that impatience<br>
Which seem&#8217;d too much enkindled, and withal<br>
Hoping it was but an effect of humour,<br>
Which sometime hath his hour with every man.<br>
It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,<br>
And could it work so much upon your shape<br>
As it hath much prevail&#8217;d on your condition,<br>
I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,<br>
Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I am not well in health, and that is all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,<br>
He would embrace the means to come by it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Is Brutus sick? and is it physical<br>
To walk unbraced and suck up the humours<br>
Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,<br>
And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,<br>
To dare the vile contagion of the night<br>
And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air<br>
To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;<br>
You have some sick offence within your mind,<br>
Which, by the right and virtue of my place,<br>
I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,<br>
I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,<br>
By all your vows of love and that great vow<br>
Which did incorporate and make us one,<br>
That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,<br>
Why you are heavy, and what men to-night<br>
Have had to resort to you: for here have been<br>
Some six or seven, who did hide their faces<br>
Even from darkness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Kneel not, gentle Portia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.<br>
Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,<br>
Is it excepted I should know no secrets<br>
That appertain to you? Am I yourself<br>
But, as it were, in sort or limitation,<br>
To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,<br>
And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs<br>
Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,<br>
Portia is Brutus&#8217; harlot, not his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You are my true and honourable wife,<br>
As dear to me as are the ruddy drops<br>
That visit my sad heart</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If this were true, then should I know this
secret.<br>
I grant I am a woman; but withal<br>
A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:<br>
I grant I am a woman; but withal<br>
A woman well-reputed, Cato&#8217;s daughter.<br>
Think you I am no stronger than my sex,<br>
Being so father&#8217;d and so husbanded?<br>
Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose &#8217;em:<br>
I have made strong proof of my constancy,<br>
Giving myself a voluntary wound<br>
Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.<br>
And not my husband&#8217;s secrets?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O ye gods,<br>
Render me worthy of this noble wife!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Knocking within</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;<br>
And by and by thy bosom shall partake<br>
The secrets of my heart.<br>
All my engagements I will construe to thee,<br>
All the charactery of my sad brows:<br>
Leave me with haste.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Portia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Lucius, who&#8217;s that knocks?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucius with
Ligarius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">He is a sick man that would speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.<br>
Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ligarius</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O, what a time have you chose out, brave
Caius,<br>
To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ligarius</p>
<p class="speech">I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand<br>
Any exploit worthy the name of honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,<br>
Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ligarius</p>
<p class="speech">By all the gods that Romans bow before,<br>
I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!<br>
Brave son, derived from honourable loins!<br>
Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up<br>
My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,<br>
And I will strive with things impossible;<br>
Yea, get the better of them. What&#8217;s to do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of work that will make sick men
whole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ligarius</p>
<p class="speech">But are not some whole that we must make
sick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">That must we also. What it is, my Caius,<br>
I shall unfold to thee, as we are going<br>
To whom it must be done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ligarius</p>
<p class="speech">Set on your foot,<br>
And with a heart new-fired I follow you,<br>
To do I know not what: but it sufficeth<br>
That Brutus leads me on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Follow me, then.</p>

<p class="speech">What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk
forth?<br>
You shall not stir out of your house to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar shall forth: the things that
threaten&#8217;d me<br>
Ne&#8217;er look&#8217;d but on my back; when they shall see<br>
The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Calpurnia</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,<br>
Yet now they fright me. There is one within,<br>
Besides the things that we have heard and seen,<br>
Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.<br>
A lioness hath whelped in the streets;<br>
And graves have yawn&#8217;d, and yielded up their dead;<br>
Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,<br>
In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,<br>
Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;<br>
The noise of battle hurtled in the air,<br>
Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,<br>
And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.<br>
O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,<br>
And I do fear them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What can be avoided<br>
Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?<br>
Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions<br>
Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Calpurnia</p>
<p class="speech">When beggars die, there are no comets seen;<br>
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Cowards die many times before their deaths;<br>
The valiant never taste of death but once.<br>
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.<br>
It seems to me most strange that men should fear;<br>
Seeing that death, a necessary end,<br>
Will come when it will come.</p>

<p class="speaker">Servant</p>

Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,<br>
They could not find a heart within the beast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">The gods do this in shame of cowardice:<br>
Caesar should be a beast without a heart,<br>
If he should stay at home to-day for fear.<br>
No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well<br>
That Caesar is more dangerous than he:<br>
We are two lions litter&#8217;d in one day,<br>
And I the elder and more terrible:<br>
And Caesar shall go forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Calpurnia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, my lord,<br>
Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.<br>
Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear<br>
That keeps you in the house, and not your own.<br>
We&#8217;ll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:<br>

Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.</p>

<p class="speech">Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,<br>
Lest I be laugh&#8217;d at when I tell them so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>

That is enough to satisfy the senate.<br>
But for your private satisfaction,<br>
Because I love you, I will let you know:<br>
Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:<br>
She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,<br>
Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,<br>
Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans<br>
Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:<br>
And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,<br>
And evils imminent; and on her knee<br>
Hath begg&#8217;d that I will stay at home to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">This dream is all amiss interpreted;<br>
It was a vision fair and fortunate:<br>
Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,<br>
In which so many smiling Romans bathed,<br>
Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck<br>
Reviving blood, and that great men shall press<br>
For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.<br>
This by Calpurnia&#8217;s dream is signified.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">And this way have you well expounded it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I have, when you have heard what I can say:<br>
And know it now: the senate have concluded<br>
To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.<br>
If you shall send them word you will not come,<br>
Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock<br>
Apt to be render&#8217;d, for some one to say<br>
&#8216;Break up the senate till another time,<br>
When Caesar&#8217;s wife shall meet with better dreams.&#8217;<br>
If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper<br>
&#8216;Lo, Caesar is afraid&#8217;?<br>
Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love<br>
To our proceeding bids me tell you this;<br>
And reason to my love is liable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>

Give me my robe, for I will go.</p>

Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:<br>
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;<br>
Say I fear&#8217;d Caesar, honour&#8217;d him and loved him.<br>
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<br>
May safely come to him, and be resolved<br>
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<br>
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<br>
So well as Brutus living; but will follow<br>

<p class="speech">O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?<br>
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<br>
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.<br>
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br>
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<br>
If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br>
As Caesar&#8217;s death hour, nor no instrument<br>
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<br>
With the most noble blood of all this world.<br>
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<br>
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br>
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<br>
I shall not find myself so apt to die:<br>
No place will please me so, no mean of death,<br>
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br>
The choice and master spirits of this age.</p>

<p class="speech">O Antony, beg not your death of us.<br>
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br>
As, by our hands and this our present act,<br>
You see we do, yet see you but our hands<br>
And this the bleeding business they have done:<br>
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<br>
And pity to the general wrong of Rome&#8212;<br>
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity&#8212;<br>
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<br>
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:<br>
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts<br>
Of brothers&#8217; temper, do receive you in<br>
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</p>

In the disposing of new dignities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Only be patient till we have appeased<br>
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,<br>
And then we will deliver you the cause,<br>
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<br>
Have thus proceeded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt not of your wisdom.<br>
Let each man render me his bloody hand:<br>
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;<br>
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;<br>
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;<br>
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;<br>
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.<br>
Gentlemen all,&#8212;alas, what shall I say?<br>
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<br>
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br>
Either a coward or a flatterer.<br>
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, &#8217;tis true:<br>
If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br>
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<br>
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,<br>
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,<br>
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?<br>
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br>
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br>
It would become me better than to close<br>
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<br>
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay&#8217;d, brave hart;<br>
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<br>
Sign&#8217;d in thy spoil, and crimson&#8217;d in thy lethe.<br>
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<br>
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.<br>
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,<br>
Dost thou here lie!</p>

But what compact mean you to have with us?<br>
Will you be prick&#8217;d in number of our friends;<br>
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</p>

I will myself into the pulpit first,<br>
And show the reason of our Caesar&#8217;s death:<br>

He speaks by leave and by permission,<br>
And that we are contented Caesar shall<br>

Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar&#8217;s, to him I say, that Brutus&#8217; love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
&#8212;Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">None, Brutus, none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Then none have I offended. I have done no more
to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antony and others, with
Caesar&#8217;s body</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony:
who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,&#8212;that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.</p>

<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You gentle Romans,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho! let us hear him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears;<br>
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>
The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br>
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
And grievously hath Caesar answer&#8217;d it.<br>
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest&#8212;<br>
For Brutus is an honourable man;<br>
So are they all, all honourable men&#8212;<br>
Come I to speak in Caesar&#8217;s funeral.<br>
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br>
But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br>
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br>
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br>
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>
And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br>
Caesar has had great wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Has he, masters?<br>
I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Mark&#8217;d ye his words? He would not take the
crown;<br>
Therefore &#8217;tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with
weeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s not a nobler man in Rome than
Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.<br>
And none so poor to do him reverence.<br>
O masters, if I were disposed to stir<br>
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br>
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<br>
Who, you all know, are honourable men:<br>
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br>
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br>
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br>
But here&#8217;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;<br>
I found it in his closet, &#8217;tis his will:<br>
Let but the commons hear this testament&#8212;<br>
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read&#8212;<br>
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar&#8217;s wounds<br>
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,<br>
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br>
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br>
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br>
Unto their issue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll hear the will: read it, Mark
Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">The will, the will! we will hear Caesar&#8217;s
will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read
it;<br>
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br>
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<br>
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,<br>
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:<br>
&#8217;Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<br>
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Read the will; we&#8217;ll hear it, Antony;<br>
You shall read us the will, Caesar&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<br>
I have o&#8217;ershot myself to tell you of it:<br>
I fear I wrong the honourable men<br>
Whose daggers have stabb&#8217;d Caesar; I do fear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">They were traitors: honourable men!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">The will! the testament!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">They were villains, murderers: the will! read the
will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You will compel me, then, to read the will?<br>
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<br>
And let me show you him that made the will.<br>
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Come down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Descend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>

<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Stand back; room; bear back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br>
You all do know this mantle: I remember<br>
The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br>
&#8217;Twas on a summer&#8217;s evening, in his tent,<br>
That day he overcame the Nervii:<br>
Look, in this place ran Cassius&#8217; dagger through:<br>
See what a rent the envious Casca made:<br>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb&#8217;d;<br>
And as he pluck&#8217;d his cursed steel away,<br>
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow&#8217;d it,<br>
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved<br>
If Brutus so unkindly knock&#8217;d, or no;<br>
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar&#8217;s angel:<br>
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br>
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br>
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br>
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors&#8217; arms,<br>
Quite vanquish&#8217;d him: then burst his mighty heart;<br>
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br>
Even at the base of Pompey&#8217;s statua,<br>
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br>
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br>
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br>
Whilst bloody treason flourish&#8217;d over us.<br>
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<br>
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<br>
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<br>
Our Caesar&#8217;s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br>
Here is himself, marr&#8217;d, as you see, with traitors.</p>

up<br>
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br>
They that have done this deed are honourable:<br>
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br>
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,<br>
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br>
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br>
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br>
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br>
That love my friend; and that they know full well<br>
That gave me public leave to speak of him:<br>
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br>
To stir men&#8217;s blood: I only speak right on;<br>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br>
Show you sweet Caesar&#8217;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br>
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<br>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<br>
In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>

<p class="speech">These many, then, shall die; their names are

<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Your brother too must die; consent you,
Lepidus?</p>

<p class="speech">I do consent&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>

<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn
him.<br>
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar&#8217;s house;<br>
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine<br>
How to cut off some charge in legacies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall I find you here?</p>

<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">This is a slight unmeritable man,<br>
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,<br>
The three-fold world divided, he should stand<br>
One of the three to share it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">So you thought him;<br>
And took his voice who should be prick&#8217;d to die,<br>
In our black sentence and proscription.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Octavius, I have seen more days than you:<br>
And though we lay these honours on this man,<br>
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,<br>
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,<br>
To groan and sweat under the business,<br>
Either led or driven, as we point the way;<br>
And having brought our treasure where we will,<br>
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,<br>
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,<br>
And graze in commons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">You may do your will;<br>
But he&#8217;s a tried and valiant soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">So is my horse, Octavius; and for that<br>
I do appoint him store of provender:<br>
It is a creature that I teach to fight,<br>
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,<br>
His corporal motion govern&#8217;d by my spirit.<br>
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;<br>
He must be taught and train&#8217;d and bid go forth;<br>
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds<br>
On abjects, orts and imitations,<br>
Which, out of use and staled by other men,<br>
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,<br>
But as a property. And now, Octavius,<br>
Listen great things:&#8212;Brutus and Cassius<br>
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:<br>
Therefore let our alliance be combined,<br>
Our best friends made, our means stretch&#8217;d<br>
And let us presently go sit in council,<br>
How covert matters may be best disclosed,<br>
And open perils surest answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Let us do so: for we are at the stake,<br>
And bay&#8217;d about with many enemies;<br>
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,<br>
Millions of mischiefs.</p>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,<br>

Hath given me some worthy cause to wish<br>
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,<br>
I shall be satisfied.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>

But not with such familiar instances,<br>
Nor with such free and friendly conference,<br>
As he hath used of old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast described<br>
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,<br>
When love begins to sicken and decay,<br>
It useth an enforced ceremony.<br>
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;<br>
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,<br>
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;<br>
But when they should endure the bloody spur,<br>
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,<br>
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</p>

Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.<br>
Before the eyes of both our armies here,<br>
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,<br>

<p class="speech">That you have wrong&#8217;d me doth appear in
this:<br>
You have condemn&#8217;d and noted Lucius Pella<br>
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;<br>
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,<br>
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">In such a time as this it is not meet<br>
That every nice offence should bear his comment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>

Are much condemn&#8217;d to have an itching palm;<br>
To sell and mart your offices for gold<br>
To undeservers.</p>

You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<br>
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Chastisement!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Remember March, the ides of March remember:<br>
Did not great Julius bleed for justice&#8217; sake?<br>
What villain touch&#8217;d his body, that did stab,<br>
And not for justice? What, shall one of us<br>
That struck the foremost man of all this world<br>
But for supporting robbers, shall we now<br>
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,<br>
And sell the mighty space of our large honours<br>
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?<br>
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<br>
Than such a Roman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Brutus, bay not me;<br>
I&#8217;ll not endure it: you forget yourself,<br>

Older in practise, abler than yourself<br>
To make conditions.</p>

<p class="speech">O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart
break;<br>
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,<br>
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<br>
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch<br>
Under your testy humour? By the gods<br>
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,<br>
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,<br>
I&#8217;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<br>
When you are waspish.</p>

<p class="speech">Do not presume too much upon my love;<br>
I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You have done that you should be sorry for.<br>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>
For I am arm&#8217;d so strong in honesty<br>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<br>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:<br>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<br>
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br>
By any indirection: I did send<br>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<br>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br>
Should I have answer&#8217;d Caius Cassius so?<br>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<br>
Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I denied you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I did not: he was but a fool that brought<br>
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:<br>
A friend should bear his friend&#8217;s infirmities,<br>
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">You love me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I do not like your faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">A flatterer&#8217;s would not, though they do
appear<br>
As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,<br>
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<br>
For Cassius is aweary of the world;<br>
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;<br>
Cheque&#8217;d like a bondman; all his faults observed,<br>
Set in a note-book, learn&#8217;d, and conn&#8217;d by rote,<br>
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<br>
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,<br>
And here my naked breast; within, a heart<br>
Dearer than Plutus&#8217; mine, richer than gold:<br>
If that thou be&#8217;st a Roman, take it forth;<br>
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:<br>
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,<br>
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better<br>
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Sheathe your dagger:<br>
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;<br>
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.<br>
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<br>
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;<br>
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,<br>
And straight is cold again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Hath Cassius lived<br>
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br>
When grief, and blood ill-temper&#8217;d, vexeth him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&#8217;d
too.</p>

<p class="speech">Have not you love enough to bear with me,<br>
When that rash humour which my mother gave me<br>
Makes me forgetful?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,<br>
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br>

<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">With what addition?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">That by proscription and bills of outlawry,<br>
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,<br>
Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Therein our letters do not well agree;<br>
Mine speak of seventy senators that died<br>
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Cicero one!</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Cicero is dead,<br>
And by that order of proscription.<br>
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Messala.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>

<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:<br>
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:<br>
With meditating that she must die once,<br>
I have the patience to endure it now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I have as much of this in art as you,<br>
But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br>
Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I do not think it good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">This it is:<br>
&#8217;Tis better that the enemy seek us:<br>
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<br>
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,<br>
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Good reasons must, of force, give place to
better.<br>
The people &#8217;twixt Philippi and this ground<br>
Do stand but in a forced affection;<br>
For they have grudged us contribution:<br>
The enemy, marching along by them,<br>
By them shall make a fuller number up,<br>
Come on refresh&#8217;d, new-added, and encouraged;<br>
From which advantage shall we cut him off,<br>
If at Philippi we do face him there,<br>
These people at our back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, good brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Under your pardon. You must note beside,<br>
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<br>
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:<br>
The enemy increaseth every day;<br>
We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br>
There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br>
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br>
Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br>
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br>
On such a full sea are we now afloat;<br>
And we must take the current when it serves,<br>
Or lose our ventures.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Then, with your will, go on;<br>
We&#8217;ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br>
And nature must obey necessity;<br>
Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br>
There is no more to say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">No more. Good night:<br>
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</p>

This was an ill beginning of the night:<br>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;<br>
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.<br>
Look, Lucius, here&#8217;s the book I sought for so;<br>
I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Varro and Claudius lie

<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">It does, my boy:<br>
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">It is my duty, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I should not urge thy duty past thy might;<br>
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;<br>
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,<br>
I will be good to thee.</p>

<p class="speech">This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,<br>
Lay&#8217;st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,<br>
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;<br>
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:<br>
If thou dost nod, thou break&#8217;st thy instrument;<br>
I&#8217;ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.<br>
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn&#8217;d down<br>
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Ghost of
Caesar</span></p>
<p class="speech">How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?<br>
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br>
That shapes this monstrous apparition.<br>
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?<br>
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,<br>
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?<br>
Speak to me what thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>

<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>

You said the enemy would not come down,<br>

It proves not so: their battles are at hand;<br>
They mean to warn us at Philippi here,<br>
Answering before we do demand of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know<br>
Wherefore they do it: they could be content<br>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, and soundless too;<br>
For you have stol&#8217;n their buzzing, Antony,<br>
And very wisely threat before you sting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Villains, you did not so, when your vile
daggers<br>
Hack&#8217;d one another in the sides of Caesar:<br>
You show&#8217;d your teeth like apes, and fawn&#8217;d like
hounds,<br>
And bow&#8217;d like bondmen, kissing Caesar&#8217;s feet;<br>
Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind<br>
Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:<br>
This tongue had not offended so to-day,<br>
If Cassius might have ruled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us
sweat,<br>
The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;<br>
I draw a sword against conspirators;<br>
When think you that the sword goes up again?<br>
Never, till Caesar&#8217;s three and thirty wounds<br>
Be well avenged; or till another Caesar<br>
Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</p>

<p class="speech">O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,<br>
Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Messala,<br>
This is my birth-day; as this very day<br>
Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:<br>
Be thou my witness that against my will,<br>
As Pompey was, am I compell&#8217;d to set<br>
Upon one battle all our liberties.<br>
You know that I held Epicurus strong<br>
And his opinion: now I change my mind,<br>
And partly credit things that do presage.<br>
Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign<br>
Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch&#8217;d,<br>
Gorging and feeding from our soldiers&#8217; hands;<br>
Who to Philippi here consorted us:<br>
This morning are they fled away and gone;<br>
And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,<br>
Fly o&#8217;er our heads and downward look on us,<br>
As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem<br>
A canopy most fatal, under which<br>
Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Believe not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I but believe it partly;<br>
For I am fresh of spirit and resolved<br>
To meet all perils very constantly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Even so, Lucilius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now, most noble Brutus,<br>
The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,<br>
Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!<br>
But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,<br>
Let&#8217;s reason with the worst that may befall.<br>
If we do lose this battle, then is this<br>
The very last time we shall speak together:<br>
What are you then determined to do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Even by the rule of that philosophy<br>
By which I did blame Cato for the death<br>
Which he did give himself, I know not how,<br>
But I do find it cowardly and vile,<br>
For fear of what might fall, so to prevent<br>
The time of life: arming myself with patience<br>
To stay the providence of some high powers<br>
That govern us below.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Then, if we lose this battle,<br>
You are contented to be led in triumph<br>
Thorough the streets of Rome?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,<br>
That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;<br>
He bears too great a mind. But this same day<br>
Must end that work the ides of March begun;<br>
And whether we shall meet again I know not.<br>
Therefore our everlasting farewell take:<br>
For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!<br>
If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;<br>
If not, why then, this parting was well made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!<br>
If we do meet again, we&#8217;ll smile indeed;<br>
If not, &#8217;tis true this parting was well made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know<br>
The end of this day&#8217;s business ere it come!<br>
But it sufficeth that the day will end,<br>
And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!</p>

<p class="speech">What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet<br>
The noble Brutus, thrusting this report<br>
Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;<br>
For piercing steel and darts envenomed<br>
Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus<br>
As tidings of this sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titinius</p>
<p class="speech">Hie you, Messala,<br>
And I will seek for Pindarus the while.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Messala</span></p>
<p class="speech">Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?<br>
Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they<br>
Put on my brows this wreath of victory,<br>
And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?<br>
Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!<br>
But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;<br>
Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I<br>
Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,<br>
And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.<br>
By your leave, gods:&#8212;this is a Roman&#8217;s part<br>
Come, Cassius&#8217; sword, and find Titinius&#8217; heart.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kills himself</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Re-enter Messala,
with Brutus, Cato, Strato, Volumnius, and Lucilius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Titinius&#8217; face is upward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cato</p>
<p class="speech">He is slain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!<br>
Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords<br>
In our own proper entrails.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Low alarums</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cato</p>
<p class="speech">Brave Titinius!<br>
Look, whether he have not crown&#8217;d dead Cassius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Are yet two Romans living such as these?<br>
The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!<br>
It is impossible that ever Rome<br>
Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears<br>
To this dead man than you shall see me pay.<br>
I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.<br>
Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:<br>
His funerals shall not be in our camp,<br>
Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;<br>
And come, young Cato; let us to the field.<br>
Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:<br>
&#8217;Tis three o&#8217;clock; and, Romans, yet ere night<br>
We shall try fortune in a second fight.</p>

I will proclaim my name about the field:<br>
I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!<br>

I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</p>

I dare assure thee that no enemy<br>
Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:<br>
The gods defend him from so great a shame!<br>
When you do find him, or alive or dead,<br>
He will be found like Brutus, like himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure
you,<br>
A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;<br>
Give him all kindness: I had rather have<br>
Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,<br>

The ghost of Caesar hath appear&#8217;d to me<br>
Two several times by night; at Sardis once,<br>
And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:<br>
I know my hour is come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnius</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.<br>
Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;<br>
Our enemies have beat us to the pit:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Low alarums</span></p>
<p class="speech">It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,<br>
Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st that we two went to school together:<br>
Even for that our love of old, I prithee,<br>
Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnius</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not an office for a friend, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum still</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Clitus</p>
<p class="speech">Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.<br>
Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;<br>
Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,<br>
My heart doth joy that yet in all my life<br>
I found no man but he was true to me.<br>
I shall have glory by this losing day<br>
More than Octavius and Mark Antony<br>
By this vile conquest shall attain unto.<br>
So fare you well at once; for Brutus&#8217; tongue<br>
Hath almost ended his life&#8217;s history:<br>
Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,<br>
That have but labour&#8217;d to attain this hour.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Cry within,
&#8216;Fly, fly, fly!&#8217;</span></p>

Thou art a fellow of a good respect;<br>

Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,<br>

master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Strato</p>
<p class="speech">Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:<br>
The conquerors can but make a fire of him;<br>

And no man else hath honour by his death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">So Brutus should be found. I thank thee,
Brutus,<br>

them.<br>
Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Strato</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, good Messala.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">How died my master, Strato?</p>
<p class="speaker">Strato</p>
<p class="speech">I held the sword, and he did run on it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Octavius, then take him to follow thee,<br>
That did the latest service to my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">This was the noblest Roman of them all:<br>
All the conspirators save only he<br>
Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;<br>
He only, in a general honest thought<br>
And common good to all, made one of them.<br>
His life was gentle, and the elements<br>
So mix&#8217;d in him that Nature might stand up<br>
And say to all the world &#8216;This was a man!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">According to his virtue let us use him,<br>
With all respect and rites of burial.<br>
Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,<br>
Most like a soldier, order&#8217;d honourably.<br>
So call the field to rest; and let&#8217;s away,<br>
To part the glories of this happy day.</p>
