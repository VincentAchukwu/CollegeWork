<h4>Scene I. Bristol. Before the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Bolingbroke, Duke
Of York, Northumberland, Lord Ross, Henry Percy, Lord Willoughby,
with Bushy and Green, prisoners</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Bring forth these men.<br>
Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls&#8212;<br>
Since presently your souls must part your bodies&#8212;<br>
With too much urging your pernicious lives,<br>
For &#8217;twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood<br>
From off my hands, here in the view of men<br>
I will unfold some causes of your deaths.<br>
You have misled a prince, a royal king,<br>
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,<br>
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:<br>
You have in manner with your sinful hours<br>
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,<br>
Broke the possession of a royal bed<br>
And stain&#8217;d the beauty of a fair queen&#8217;s cheeks<br>
With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.<br>
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,<br>
Near to the king in blood, and near in love<br>
Till you did make him misinterpret me,<br>
Have stoop&#8217;d my neck under your injuries,<br>
And sigh&#8217;d my English breath in foreign clouds,<br>
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;<br>
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,<br>
Dispark&#8217;d my parks and fell&#8217;d my forest woods,<br>
From my own windows torn my household coat,<br>
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,<br>
Save men&#8217;s opinions and my living blood,<br>
To show the world I am a gentleman.<br>
This and much more, much more than twice all this,<br>
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver&#8217;d over<br>
To execution and the hand of death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">More welcome is the stroke of death to me<br>
Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">My comfort is that heaven will take our souls<br>
And plague injustice with the pains of hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Northumberland, see them
dispatch&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Northumberland and
others, with the prisoners</span></p>
<p class="speech">Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;<br>
For God&#8217;s sake, fairly let her be entreated:<br>
Tell her I send to her my kind commends;<br>
Take special care my greetings be deliver&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">A gentleman of mine I have dispatch&#8217;d<br>
With letters of your love to her at large.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.<br>
To fight with Glendower and his complices:<br>
Awhile to work, and after holiday.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drums; flourish and colours.
Enter King Richard II, the Bishop Of Carlisle, Duke Of Aumerle, and
Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,<br>
After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy<br>
To stand upon my kingdom once again.<br>
Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,<br>
Though rebels wound thee with their horses&#8217; hoofs:<br>
As a long-parted mother with her child<br>
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,<br>
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,<br>
And do thee favours with my royal hands.<br>
Feed not thy sovereign&#8217;s foe, my gentle earth,<br>
Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;<br>
But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,<br>
And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,<br>
Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet<br>
Which with usurping steps do trample thee:<br>
Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;<br>
And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,<br>
Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder<br>
Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch<br>
Throw death upon thy sovereign&#8217;s enemies.<br>
Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:<br>
This earth shall have a feeling and these stones<br>
Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king<br>
Shall falter under foul rebellion&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you
king<br>
Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.<br>
The means that heaven yields must be embraced,<br>
And not neglected; else, if heaven would,<br>
And we will not, heaven&#8217;s offer we refuse,<br>
The proffer&#8217;d means of succor and redress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;<br>
Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,<br>
Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Discomfortable cousin! know&#8217;st thou not<br>
That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,<br>
Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,<br>
Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen<br>
In murders and in outrage, boldly here;<br>
But when from under this terrestrial ball<br>
He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines<br>
And darts his light through every guilty hole,<br>
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,<br>
The cloak of night being pluck&#8217;d from off their backs,<br>
Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?<br>
So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,<br>
Who all this while hath revell&#8217;d in the night<br>
Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,<br>
Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,<br>
His treasons will sit blushing in his face,<br>
Not able to endure the sight of day,<br>
But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.<br>
Not all the water in the rough rude sea<br>
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;<br>
The breath of worldly men cannot depose<br>
The deputy elected by the Lord:<br>
For every man that Bolingbroke hath press&#8217;d<br>
To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,<br>
God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay<br>
A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,<br>
Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Earl Of
Salisbury</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lord how far off lies your power?</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,<br>
Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue<br>
And bids me speak of nothing but despair.<br>
One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,<br>
Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:<br>
O, call back yesterday, bid time return,<br>
And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!<br>
To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,<br>
O&#8217;erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:<br>
For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.<br>
Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so
pale?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">But now the blood of twenty thousand men<br>
Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;<br>
And, till so much blood thither come again,<br>
Have I not reason to look pale and dead?<br>
All souls that will be safe fly from my side,<br>
For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">I had forgot myself; am I not king?<br>
Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.<br>
Is not the king&#8217;s name twenty thousand names?<br>
Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes<br>
At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,<br>
Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?<br>
High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York<br>
Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Stephen
Scroop</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">More health and happiness betide my liege<br>
Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;<br>
The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.<br>
Say, is my kingdom lost? why, &#8217;twas my care<br>
And what loss is it to be rid of care?<br>
Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?<br>
Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,<br>
We&#8217;ll serve Him too and be his fellow so:<br>
Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;<br>
They break their faith to God as well as us:<br>
Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:<br>
The worst is death, and death will have his day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Glad am I that your highness is so
arm&#8217;d<br>
To bear the tidings of calamity.<br>
Like an unseasonable stormy day,<br>
Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,<br>
As if the world were all dissolved to tears,<br>
So high above his limits swells the rage<br>
Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land<br>
With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.<br>
White-beards have arm&#8217;d their thin and hairless scalps<br>
Against thy majesty; boys, with women&#8217;s voices,<br>
Strive to speak big and clap their female joints<br>
In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:<br>
The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows<br>
Of double-fatal yew against thy state;<br>
Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills<br>
Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,<br>
And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Too well, too well thou tell&#8217;st a tale so
ill.<br>
Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?<br>
What is become of Bushy? where is Green?<br>
That they have let the dangerous enemy<br>
Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?<br>
If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:<br>
I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Peace have they made with him indeed, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">O villains, vipers, damn&#8217;d without
redemption!<br>
Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!<br>
Snakes, in my heart-blood warm&#8217;d, that sting my heart!<br>
Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!<br>
Would they make peace? terrible hell make war<br>
Upon their spotted souls for this offence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet love, I see, changing his property,<br>
Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:<br>
Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made<br>
With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse<br>
Have felt the worst of death&#8217;s destroying wound<br>
And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire
dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the duke my father with his power?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">No matter where; of comfort no man speak:<br>
Let&#8217;s talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;<br>
Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes<br>
Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,<br>
Let&#8217;s choose executors and talk of wills:<br>
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath<br>
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?<br>
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke&#8217;s,<br>
And nothing can we call our own but death<br>
And that small model of the barren earth<br>
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.<br>
For God&#8217;s sake, let us sit upon the ground<br>
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;<br>
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,<br>
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;<br>
Some poison&#8217;d by their wives: some sleeping kill&#8217;d;<br>
All murder&#8217;d: for within the hollow crown<br>
That rounds the mortal temples of a king<br>
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,<br>
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,<br>
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,<br>
To monarchize, be fear&#8217;d and kill with looks,<br>
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,<br>
As if this flesh which walls about our life,<br>
Were brass impregnable, and humour&#8217;d thus<br>
Comes at the last and with a little pin<br>
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!<br>
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood<br>
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,<br>
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,<br>
For you have but mistook me all this while:<br>
I live with bread like you, feel want,<br>
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,<br>
How can you say to me, I am a king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, wise men ne&#8217;er sit and wail their
woes,<br>
But presently prevent the ways to wail.<br>
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,<br>
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,<br>
And so your follies fight against yourself.<br>
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:<br>
And fight and die is death destroying death;<br>
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">My father hath a power; inquire of him<br>
And learn to make a body of a limb.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I
come<br>
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.<br>
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;<br>
An easy task it is to win our own.<br>
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?<br>
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Men judge by the complexion of the sky<br>
The state and inclination of the day:<br>
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,<br>
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.<br>
I play the torturer, by small and small<br>
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:<br>
Your uncle York is join&#8217;d with Bolingbroke,<br>
And all your northern castles yielded up,<br>
And all your southern gentlemen in arms<br>
Upon his party.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou hast said enough.<br>
Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Duke Of Aumerle</span></p>
<p class="speech">Of that sweet way I was in to despair!<br>
What say you now? what comfort have we now?<br>
By heaven, I&#8217;ll hate him everlastingly<br>
That bids me be of comfort any more.<br>
Go to Flint castle: there I&#8217;ll pine away;<br>
A king, woe&#8217;s slave, shall kingly woe obey.<br>
That power I have, discharge; and let them go<br>
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,<br>
For I have none: let no man speak again<br>
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, one word.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">He does me double wrong<br>
That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.<br>
Discharge my followers: let them hence away,<br>
From Richard&#8217;s night to Bolingbroke&#8217;s fair day.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<h4>Scene III. Wales. Before Flint castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, with drum and colours,
Henry Bolingbroke, Duke Of York, Northumberland, Attendants, and
forces</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">So that by this intelligence we learn<br>
The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury<br>
Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed<br>
With some few private friends upon this coast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">The news is very fair and good, my lord:<br>
Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">It would beseem the Lord Northumberland<br>
To say &#8216;King Richard:&#8217; alack the heavy day<br>
When such a sacred king should hide his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Your grace mistakes; only to be brief<br>
Left I his title out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">The time hath been,<br>
Would you have been so brief with him, he would<br>
Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,<br>
For taking so the head, your whole head&#8217;s length.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Take not, good cousin, further than you
should.<br>
Lest you mistake the heavens are o&#8217;er our heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself<br>
Against their will. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Percy</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle
yield?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">The castle royally is mann&#8217;d, my lord,<br>
Against thy entrance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Royally!<br>
Why, it contains no king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, my good lord,<br>
It doth contain a king; King Richard lies<br>
Within the limits of yon lime and stone:<br>
And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,<br>
Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman<br>
Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Noble lords,<br>
Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;<br>
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley<br>
Into his ruin&#8217;d ears, and thus deliver:<br>
Henry Bolingbroke<br>
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard&#8217;s hand<br>
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart<br>
To his most royal person, hither come<br>
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,<br>
Provided that my banishment repeal&#8217;d<br>
And lands restored again be freely granted:<br>
If not, I&#8217;ll use the advantage of my power<br>
And lay the summer&#8217;s dust with showers of blood<br>
Rain&#8217;d from the wounds of slaughter&#8217;d Englishmen:<br>
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke<br>
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench<br>
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard&#8217;s land,<br>
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.<br>
Go, signify as much, while here we march<br>
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.<br>
Let&#8217;s march without the noise of threatening drum,<br>
That from this castle&#8217;s tatter&#8217;d battlements<br>
Our fair appointments may be well perused.<br>
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet<br>
With no less terror than the elements<br>
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock<br>
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.<br>
Be he the fire, I&#8217;ll be the yielding water:<br>
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain<br>
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.<br>
March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Parle without, and answer
within. Then a flourish. Enter on the walls, King Richard II, the
Bishop Of Carlisle, Duke Of Aumerle, Sir Stephen Scroop, and Earl
Of Salisbury</span></p>
<p class="speech">See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,<br>
As doth the blushing discontented sun<br>
From out the fiery portal of the east,<br>
When he perceives the envious clouds are bent<br>
To dim his glory and to stain the track<br>
Of his bright passage to the occident.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,<br>
As bright as is the eagle&#8217;s, lightens forth<br>
Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,<br>
That any harm should stain so fair a show!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We are amazed; and thus long have we stood<br>
To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Northumberland</span></p>
<p class="speech">Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:<br>
And if we be, how dare thy joints forget<br>
To pay their awful duty to our presence?<br>
If we be not, show us the hand of God<br>
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;<br>
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone<br>
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,<br>
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.<br>
And though you think that all, as you have done,<br>
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,<br>
And we are barren and bereft of friends;<br>
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,<br>
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf<br>
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike<br>
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,<br>
That lift your vassal hands against my head<br>
And threat the glory of my precious crown.<br>
Tell Bolingbroke&#8212;for yond methinks he stands&#8212;<br>
That every stride he makes upon my land<br>
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open<br>
The purple testament of bleeding war;<br>
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,<br>
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers&#8217; sons<br>
Shall ill become the flower of England&#8217;s face,<br>
Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace<br>
To scarlet indignation and bedew<br>
Her pastures&#8217; grass with faithful English blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">The king of heaven forbid our lord the king<br>
Should so with civil and uncivil arms<br>
Be rush&#8217;d upon! Thy thrice noble cousin<br>
Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;<br>
And by the honourable tomb he swears,<br>
That stands upon your royal grandsire&#8217;s bones,<br>
And by the royalties of both your bloods,<br>
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,<br>
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,<br>
And by the worth and honour of himself,<br>
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,<br>
His coming hither hath no further scope<br>
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg<br>
Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:<br>
Which on thy royal party granted once,<br>
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,<br>
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart<br>
To faithful service of your majesty.<br>
This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;<br>
And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland, say thus the king returns:<br>
His noble cousin is right welcome hither;<br>
And all the number of his fair demands<br>
Shall be accomplish&#8217;d without contradiction:<br>
With all the gracious utterance thou hast<br>
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.<br>
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Duke Of Aumerle</span></p>
<p class="speech">To look so poorly and to speak so fair?<br>
Shall we call back Northumberland, and send<br>
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">No, good my lord; let&#8217;s fight with gentle
words<br>
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">O God, O God! that e&#8217;er this tongue of
mine,<br>
That laid the sentence of dread banishment<br>
On yon proud man, should take it off again<br>
With words of sooth! O that I were as great<br>
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!<br>
Or that I could forget what I have been,<br>
Or not remember what I must be now!<br>
Swell&#8217;st thou, proud heart? I&#8217;ll give thee scope to
beat,<br>
Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What must the king do now? must he submit?<br>
The king shall do it: must he be deposed?<br>
The king shall be contented: must he lose<br>
The name of king? o&#8217; God&#8217;s name, let it go:<br>
I&#8217;ll give my jewels for a set of beads,<br>
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,<br>
My gay apparel for an almsman&#8217;s gown,<br>
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,<br>
My sceptre for a palmer&#8217;s walking staff,<br>
My subjects for a pair of carved saints<br>
And my large kingdom for a little grave,<br>
A little little grave, an obscure grave;<br>
Or I&#8217;ll be buried in the king&#8217;s highway,<br>
Some way of common trade, where subjects&#8217; feet<br>
May hourly trample on their sovereign&#8217;s head;<br>
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;<br>
And buried once, why not upon my head?<br>
Aumerle, thou weep&#8217;st, my tender-hearted cousin!<br>
We&#8217;ll make foul weather with despised tears;<br>
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,<br>
And make a dearth in this revolting land.<br>
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,<br>
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?<br>
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,<br>
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves<br>
Within the earth; and, therein laid,&#8212;there lies<br>
Two kinsmen digg&#8217;d their graves with weeping eyes.<br>
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see<br>
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.<br>
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,<br>
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty<br>
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?<br>
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, in the base court he doth attend<br>
To speak with you; may it please you to come down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,<br>
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.<br>
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,<br>
To come at traitors&#8217; calls and do them grace.<br>
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
down, king!<br>
For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
should sing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt from above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">What says his majesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Sorrow and grief of heart<br>
Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man<br>
Yet he is come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard and his
attendants below</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Stand all apart,<br>
And show fair duty to his majesty.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He kneels down</span></p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee<br>
To make the base earth proud with kissing it:<br>
Me rather had my heart might feel your love<br>
Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.<br>
Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,<br>
Thus high at least, although your knee be low.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,<br>
As my true service shall deserve your love.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,<br>
That know the strong&#8217;st and surest way to get.<br>
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;<br>
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.<br>
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,<br>
Though you are old enough to be my heir.<br>
What you will have, I&#8217;ll give, and willing too;<br>
For do we must what force will have us do.<br>
Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Then I must not say no.</p>

<h4>Scene IV. Langley. The Duke Of York&#8217;s garden.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Queen and two
Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">What sport shall we devise here in this
garden,<br>
To drive away the heavy thought of care?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we&#8217;ll play at bowls.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twill make me think the world is full of
rubs,<br>
And that my fortune rubs against the bias.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we&#8217;ll dance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">My legs can keep no measure in delight,<br>
When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:<br>
Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we&#8217;ll tell tales.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Of sorrow or of joy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">Of either, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Of neither, girl:<br>
For of joy, being altogether wanting,<br>
It doth remember me the more of sorrow;<br>
Or if of grief, being altogether had,<br>
It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:<br>
For what I have I need not to repeat;<br>
And what I want it boots not to complain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I&#8217;ll sing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well that thou hast cause<br>
But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady</p>
<p class="speech">I could weep, madam, would it do you good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">And I could sing, would weeping do me good,<br>
And never borrow any tear of thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Gardener, and two
Servants</span></p>
<p class="speech">But stay, here come the gardeners:<br>
Let&#8217;s step into the shadow of these trees.<br>
My wretchedness unto a row of pins,<br>
They&#8217;ll talk of state; for every one doth so<br>
Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Queen and Ladies
retire</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,<br>
Which, like unruly children, make their sire<br>
Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:<br>
Give some supportance to the bending twigs.<br>
Go thou, and like an executioner,<br>
Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,<br>
That look too lofty in our commonwealth:<br>
All must be even in our government.<br>
You thus employ&#8217;d, I will go root away<br>
The noisome weeds, which without profit suck<br>
The soil&#8217;s fertility from wholesome flowers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Why should we in the compass of a pale<br>
Keep law and form and due proportion,<br>
Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,<br>
When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,<br>
Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,<br>
Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin&#8217;d,<br>
Her knots disorder&#8217;d and her wholesome herbs<br>
Swarming with caterpillars?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">Hold thy peace:<br>
He that hath suffer&#8217;d this disorder&#8217;d spring<br>
Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:<br>
The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,<br>
That seem&#8217;d in eating him to hold him up,<br>
Are pluck&#8217;d up root and all by Bolingbroke,<br>
I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">What, are they dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">They are; and Bolingbroke<br>
Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it<br>
That he had not so trimm&#8217;d and dress&#8217;d his land<br>
As we this garden! We at time of year<br>
Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,<br>
Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,<br>
With too much riches it confound itself:<br>
Had he done so to great and growing men,<br>
They might have lived to bear and he to taste<br>
Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches<br>
We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:<br>
Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,<br>
Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">What, think you then the king shall be
deposed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">Depress&#8217;d he is already, and deposed<br>
&#8217;Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night<br>
To a dear friend of the good Duke of York&#8217;s,<br>
That tell black tidings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am press&#8217;d to death through want of
speaking!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Coming forward</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou, old Adam&#8217;s likeness, set to dress
this garden,<br>
How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?<br>
What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee<br>
To make a second fall of cursed man?<br>
Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?<br>
Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,<br>
Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,<br>
Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, madam: little joy have I<br>
To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.<br>
King Richard, he is in the mighty hold<br>
Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh&#8217;d:<br>
In your lord&#8217;s scale is nothing but himself,<br>
And some few vanities that make him light;<br>
But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,<br>
Besides himself, are all the English peers,<br>
And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.<br>
Post you to London, and you will find it so;<br>
I speak no more than every one doth know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,<br>
Doth not thy embassage belong to me,<br>
And am I last that knows it? O, thou think&#8217;st<br>
To serve me last, that I may longest keep<br>
Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,<br>
To meet at London London&#8217;s king in woe.<br>
What, was I born to this, that my sad look<br>
Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?<br>
Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,<br>
Pray God the plants thou graft&#8217;st may never grow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Queen and
Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gardener</p>
<p class="speech">Poor queen! so that thy state might be no
worse,<br>
I would my skill were subject to thy curse.<br>
Here did she fall a tear; here in this place<br>
I&#8217;ll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:<br>
Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,<br>
In the remembrance of a weeping queen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
