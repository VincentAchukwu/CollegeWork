<h3>ACT I</h3>
<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title=
"Scene I. Verona. An open place.">
<h4>Scene I. Verona. An open place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine and
Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:<br>
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.<br>
Were&#8217;t not affection chains thy tender days<br>
To the sweet glances of thy honour&#8217;d love,<br>
I rather would entreat thy company<br>
To see the wonders of the world abroad,<br>
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,<br>
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.<br>
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,<br>
Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!<br>
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest<br>
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:<br>
Wish me partaker in thy happiness<br>
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,<br>
If ever danger do environ thee,<br>
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,<br>
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And on a love-book pray for my success?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon some book I love I&#8217;ll pray for
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s on some shallow story of deep
love:<br>
How young Leander cross&#8217;d the Hellespont.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a deep story of a deeper love:<br>
For he was more than over shoes in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; for you are over boots in
love,<br>
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To be in love, where scorn is bought with
groans;<br>
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment&#8217;s
mirth<br>
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:<br>
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;<br>
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;<br>
However, but a folly bought with wit,<br>
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, I fear you&#8217;ll
prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Love is your master, for he masters you:<br>
And he that is so yoked by a fool,<br>
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud<br>
The eating canker dwells, so eating love<br>
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And writers say, as the most forward bud<br>
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,<br>
Even so by love the young and tender wit<br>
Is turn&#8217;d to folly, blasting in the bud,<br>
Losing his verdure even in the prime<br>
And all the fair effects of future hopes.<br>
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,<br>
That art a votary to fond desire?<br>
Once more adieu! my father at the road<br>
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.<br>
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters<br>
Of thy success in love, and what news else<br>
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;<br>
And likewise will visit thee with mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">As much to you at home! and so, farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">He after honour hunts, I after love:<br>
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,<br>
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.<br>
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,<br>
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,<br>
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;<br>
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Speed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Twenty to one then he is shipp&#8217;d
already,<br>
And I have play&#8217;d the sheep in losing him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,<br>
An if the shepherd be a while away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You conclude that my master is a shepherd,
then,
and I a sheep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake
or sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">This proves me still a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">True; and thy master a shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">It shall go hard but I&#8217;ll prove it by
another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep
the
shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
not me: therefore I am no sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Such another proof will make me cry
&#8216;baa.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to
Julia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to
her,
a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
lost mutton, nothing for my labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s too small a pasture for such store
of muttons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay: in that you are astray, &#8217;twere best
pound you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me
for
carrying your letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake; I mean the pound,&#8212;a
pinfold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
&#8217;Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But what said she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[First nodding]</span>
Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Nod&#8212;Ay&#8212;why, that&#8217;s noddy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you
ask
me if she did nod; and I say, &#8216;Ay.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And that set together is noddy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Now you have taken the pains to set it
together,
take it for your pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; you shall have it for bearing the
letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why sir, how do you bear with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having
nothing
but the word &#8216;noddy&#8217; for my pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Come come, open the matter in brief: what said
she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Open your purse, that the money and the matter
may
be both at once delivered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said
she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, I think you&#8217;ll hardly win
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her;
no,
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
fear she&#8217;ll prove as hard to you in telling your
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she&#8217;s as
hard as steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What said she? nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">No, not so much as &#8216;Take this for thy
pains.&#8217; To
testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
letters yourself: and so, sir, I&#8217;ll commend you to my
master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from
wreck,<br>
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,<br>
Being destined to a drier death on shore.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Speed</span></p>
<p class="speech">I must go send some better messenger:<br>
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,<br>
Receiving them from such a worthless post.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. Garden of Julia&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter JullA and
Lucetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,<br>
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Of all the fair resort of gentlemen<br>
That every day with parle encounter me,<br>
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Please you repeat their names, I&#8217;ll show my
mind<br>
According to my shallow simple skill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the fair Sir
Eglamour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;<br>
But, were I you, he never should be mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the rich
Mercatio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the gentle
Proteus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what means this passion at his name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, dear madam: &#8217;tis a passing
shame<br>
That I, unworthy body as I am,<br>
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus: of many good I think him best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I have no other, but a woman&#8217;s reason;<br>
I think him so because I think him so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves
ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">His little speaking shows his love but small.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Fire that&#8217;s closest kept burns most of
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">They do not love that do not show their love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">O, they love least that let men know their
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I would I knew his mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Peruse this paper, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;To Julia.&#8217; Say, from whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">That the contents will show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Say, say, who gave it thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Valentine&#8217;s page; and sent, I think, from
Proteus.<br>
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,<br>
Did in your name receive it: pardon the
fault I pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!<br>
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?<br>
To whisper and conspire against my youth?<br>
Now, trust me, &#8217;tis an office of great worth<br>
And you an officer fit for the place.<br>
Or else return no more into my sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">To plead for love deserves more fee than
hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Will ye be gone?</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That you may ruminate.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I would I had o&#8217;erlooked the
letter:<br>
It were a shame to call her back again<br>
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.<br>
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,<br>
And would not force the letter to my view!<br>
Since maids, in modesty, say &#8216;no&#8217; to that<br>
Which they would have the profferer construe &#8216;ay.&#8217;<br>
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love<br>
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse<br>
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!<br>
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,<br>
When willingly I would have had her here!<br>
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,<br>
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!<br>
My penance is to call Lucetta back<br>
And ask remission for my folly past.<br>
What ho! Lucetta!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What would your ladyship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t near dinner-time?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were,<br>
That you might kill your stomach on your meat<br>
And not upon your maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t that you took up so gingerly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why didst thou stoop, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">To take a paper up that I let fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And is that paper nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing concerning me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, it will not lie where it concerns<br>
Unless it have a false interpeter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.<br>
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">As little by such toys as may be possible.<br>
Best sing it to the tune of &#8216;Light o&#8217; love.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">It is too heavy for so light a tune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And why not you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>

<p class="speech">Nay, now you are too flat<br>
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:<br>
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>

O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!<br>
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey<br>
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!<br>
I&#8217;ll kiss each several paper for amends.<br>
Look, here is writ &#8216;kind Julia.&#8217; Unkind Julia!<br>
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,<br>
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,<br>
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.<br>
And here is writ &#8216;love-wounded Proteus.&#8217;<br>
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed<br>
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal&#8217;d;<br>
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.<br>
But twice or thrice was &#8216;Proteus&#8217; written down.<br>
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away<br>
Till I have found each letter in the letter,<br>
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear<br>
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock<br>
And throw it thence into the raging sea!<br>
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,<br>
&#8216;Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,<br>
To the sweet Julia:&#8217; that I&#8217;ll tear away.<br>
And yet I will not, sith so prettily<br>
He couples it to his complaining names.<br>
Thus will I fold them one on another:<br>
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</p>

<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He wonder&#8217;d that your
lordship<br>
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,<br>
While other men, of slender reputation,<br>
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:<br>
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;<br>
Some to discover islands far away;<br>
Some to the studious universities.<br>
For any or for all these exercises,<br>
He said that Proteus your son was meet,<br>
And did request me to importune you<br>
To let him spend his time no more at home,<br>
Which would be great impeachment to his age,<br>
In having known no travel in his youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nor need&#8217;st thou much importune me to
that<br>
Whereon this month I have been hammering.<br>
I have consider&#8217;d well his loss of time<br>
And how he cannot be a perfect man,<br>
Not being tried and tutor&#8217;d in the world:<br>
Experience is by industry achieved<br>
And perfected by the swift course of time.<br>
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">I think your lordship is not ignorant<br>
How his companion, youthful Valentine,<br>
Attends the emperor in his royal court.</p>

<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere good, I think, your lordship sent
him thither:<br>
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,<br>
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.<br>
And be in eye of every exercise<br>
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:<br>
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,<br>
The execution of it shall make known.<br>
Even with the speediest expedition<br>
I will dispatch him to the emperor&#8217;s court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>

Are journeying to salute the emperor<br>
And to commend their service to his will.</p>

O heavenly Julia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what letter are you reading there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">May&#8217;t please your lordship, &#8217;tis a

Deliver&#8217;d by a friend that came from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Lend me the letter; let me see what news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">There is no news, my lord, but that he writes<br>
How happily he lives, how well beloved<br>
And daily graced by the emperor;<br>
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And how stand you affected to his wish?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">As one relying on your lordship&#8217;s will<br>
And not depending on his friendly wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">My will is something sorted with his wish.<br>
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;<br>
For what I will, I will, and there an end.<br>
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time<br>
With Valentinus in the emperor&#8217;s court:<br>
What maintenance he from his friends receives,<br>
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.<br>
To-morrow be in readiness to go:<br>
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</p>

Please you, deliberate a day or two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what thou want&#8217;st shall be sent after
thee:<br>
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.<br>

<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it&#8217;s
mine:<br>
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!<br>
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How now, sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She is not within hearing, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, who bade you call her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you&#8217;ll still be too forward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I was last chidden for being too
slow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam
Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She that your worship loves?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how know you that I am in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, by these special marks: first, you
have
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
on you, I can hardly think you my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Are all these things perceived in me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">They are all perceived without ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Without me? they cannot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Without you? nay, that&#8217;s certain, for,
without you
were so simple, none else would: but you are so
without these follies, that these follies are within
you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She that you gaze on so as she sits at
supper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I know her not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and
yet
knowest her not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not hard-favoured, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I know that well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">That she is not so fair as, of you,
well-favoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her
favour infinite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s because the one is painted and the
other out
of all count.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How painted? and how out of count?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that
no
man counts of her beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How esteemest thou me? I account of her
beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You never saw her since she was deformed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How long hath she been deformed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Ever since you loved her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still
I
see her beautiful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">If you love her, you cannot see her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine
eyes;
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
ungartered!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What should I see then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Your own present folly and her passing
deformity:
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank
you,
you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">I would you were set, so your affection would
cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Last night she enjoined me to write some lines

<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>

For being ignorant to whom it goes<br>
I writ at random, very doubtfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance you think too much of so much
pains?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam; so it stead you, I will write<br>
Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;<br>
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;<br>
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,<br>

Nay, take them.</p>

<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;<br>

I would have had them writ more movingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, I&#8217;ll write your ladyship
another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">And when it&#8217;s writ, for my sake read it
over,<br>
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.</p>

For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,<br>
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;<br>
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,<br>
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.<br>
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.<br>
Why muse you, sir? &#8217;tis dinner-time.</p>

dog</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;twill be this hour ere I have done
weeping;
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
have received my proportion, like the prodigious
son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial&#8217;s
court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This
shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
on&#8217;t! there &#8217;tis: now, sit, this staff is my
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
dog&#8212;Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
&#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down.
Now
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Panthino</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is
shipped
and thou art to post after with oars. What&#8217;s the
matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You&#8217;ll
lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is
the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the unkindest tide?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he that&#8217;s tied here, Crab, my dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, man, I mean thou&#8217;lt lose the flood,
and, in
losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
service,&#8212;Why dost thou stop my mouth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Where should I lose my tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">In thy tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">In thy tail!</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,
and
the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come away, man; I was sent to call
thee.</p>

<p class="speech">Who is that, servant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire.
Sir
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship&#8217;s looks,

<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I
shall
make your wit bankrupt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of
words,
and, I think, no other treasure to give your
followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
that they live by your bare words.</p>

<p class="speech">Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.<br>
Sir Valentine, your father&#8217;s in good health:<br>
What say you to a letter from your friends<br>
Of much good news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, I will be thankful.<br>
To any happy messenger from thence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman<br>
To be of worth and worthy estimation<br>
And not without desert so well reputed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he not a son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves<br>
The honour and regard of such a father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">You know him well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I know him as myself; for from our infancy<br>
We have conversed and spent our hours together:<br>
And though myself have been an idle truant,<br>
Omitting the sweet benefit of time<br>
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,<br>
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that&#8217;s his name,<br>
Made use and fair advantage of his days;<br>
His years but young, but his experience old;<br>
His head unmellow&#8217;d, but his judgment ripe;<br>
And, in a word, for far behind his worth<br>
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,<br>
He is complete in feature and in mind<br>
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,<br>
He is as worthy for an empress&#8217; love<br>
As meet to be an emperor&#8217;s counsellor.<br>
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,<br>
With commendation from great potentates;<br>
And here he means to spend his time awhile:<br>
I think &#8217;tis no unwelcome news to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Should I have wish&#8217;d a thing, it had been
he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome him then according to his worth.<br>
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;<br>
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:<br>
I will send him hither to you presently.</p>

<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>

How could he see his way to seek out you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>

<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">They say that Love hath not an eye at all.</p>

Confirm his welcome with some special favour.</p>

<p class="speech">His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,<br>
If this be he you oft have wish&#8217;d to hear from.</p>

<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Too low a mistress for so high a servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>

To have a look of such a worthy mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Leave off discourse of disability:<br>
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My duty will I boast of; nothing else.</p>

<p class="speech">And duty never yet did want his meed:<br>
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll die on him that says so but
yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>

Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:<br>
I&#8217;ll leave you to confer of home affairs;<br>
When you have done, we look to hear from you.</p>

Thurio</span></p>

<p class="speech">Now, tell me, how do all from whence you
came?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Your friends are well and have them much
commended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And how do yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I left them all in health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How does your lady? and how thrives your
love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My tales of love were wont to weary you;<br>
I know you joy not in a love discourse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter&#8217;d
now:<br>
I have done penance for contemning Love,<br>
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish&#8217;d me<br>
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,<br>
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;<br>
For in revenge of my contempt of love,<br>
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes<br>
And made them watchers of mine own heart&#8217;s sorrow.<br>
O gentle Proteus, Love&#8217;s a mighty lord,<br>
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,<br>
There is no woe to his correction,<br>
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.<br>
Now no discourse, except it be of love;<br>
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,<br>
Upon the very naked name of love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.<br>
Was this the idol that you worship so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No; but she is an earthly paragon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Call her divine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will not flatter her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,<br>
And I must minister the like to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,<br>
Yet let her be a principality,<br>
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Except my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet, except not any;<br>
Except thou wilt except against my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not reason to prefer mine own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And I will help thee to prefer her too:<br>
She shall be dignified with this high honour&#8212;<br>
To bear my lady&#8217;s train, lest the base earth<br>
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss<br>
And, of so great a favour growing proud,<br>
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower<br>
And make rough winter everlastingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing<br>
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;<br>
She is alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Then let her alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,<br>
And I as rich in having such a jewel<br>
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,<br>
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.<br>
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,<br>
Because thou see&#8217;st me dote upon my love.<br>
My foolish rival, that her father likes<br>
Only for his possessions are so huge,<br>
Is gone with her along, and I must after,<br>
For love, thou know&#8217;st, is full of jealousy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But she loves you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and we are betroth&#8217;d: nay, more,
our,
marriage-hour,<br>
With all the cunning manner of our flight,<br>
Determined of; how I must climb her window,<br>
The ladder made of cords, and all the means<br>
Plotted and &#8216;greed on for my happiness.<br>
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,<br>
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:<br>
I must unto the road, to disembark<br>
Some necessaries that I needs must use,<br>
And then I&#8217;ll presently attend you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Will you make haste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Valentine</span></p>
<p class="speech">Even as one heat another heat expels,<br>
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,<br>
So the remembrance of my former love<br>
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.<br>
Is it mine, or Valentine&#8217;s praise,<br>
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,<br>
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?<br>
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love&#8212;<br>
That I did love, for now my love is thaw&#8217;d;<br>
Which, like a waxen image, &#8217;gainst a fire,<br>
Bears no impression of the thing it was.<br>
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,<br>
And that I love him not as I was wont.<br>
O, but I love his lady too too much,<br>
And that&#8217;s the reason I love him so little.<br>
How shall I dote on her with more advice,<br>
That thus without advice begin to love her!<br>
&#8217;Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,<br>
And that hath dazzled my reason&#8217;s light;<br>
But when I look on her perfections,<br>
There is no reason but I shall be blind.<br>
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;<br>
If not, to compass her I&#8217;ll use my skill.</p>

<p class="speaker">Speed</p>

<p class="speech">To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;<br>
To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;<br>
To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;<br>
And even that power which gave me first my oath<br>
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;<br>
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.<br>
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,<br>
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!<br>
At first I did adore a twinkling star,<br>
But now I worship a celestial sun.<br>
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,<br>
And he wants wit that wants resolved will<br>
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.<br>
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,<br>
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr&#8217;d<br>
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.<br>
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;<br>
But there I leave to love where I should love.<br>
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:<br>
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;<br>
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss<br>
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.<br>
I to myself am dearer than a friend,<br>
For love is still most precious in itself;<br>
And Silvia&#8212;witness Heaven, that made her fair!&#8212;<br>
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.<br>
I will forget that Julia is alive,<br>
Remembering that my love to her is dead;<br>
And Valentine I&#8217;ll hold an enemy,<br>
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.<br>
I cannot now prove constant to myself,<br>
Without some treachery used to Valentine.<br>
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder<br>
To climb celestial Silvia&#8217;s chamber-window,<br>
Myself in counsel, his competitor.<br>
Now presently I&#8217;ll give her father notice<br>
Of their disguising and pretended flight;<br>
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;<br>
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;<br>
But, Valentine being gone, I&#8217;ll quickly cross<br>
By some sly trick blunt Thurio&#8217;s dull proceeding.<br>
Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,<br>
As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!</p>

Lucetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;<br>
And even in kind love I do conjure thee,<br>
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts<br>
Are visibly character&#8217;d and engraved,<br>
To lesson me and tell me some good mean<br>
How, with my honour, I may undertake<br>
A journey to my loving Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the way is wearisome and long!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary<br>
To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;<br>
Much less shall she that hath Love&#8217;s wings to fly,<br>
And when the flight is made to one so dear,<br>
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Better forbear till Proteus make return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">O, know&#8217;st thou not his looks are my
soul&#8217;s food?<br>
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,<br>
By longing for that food so long a time.<br>
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,<br>
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow<br>
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I do not seek to quench your love&#8217;s hot
fire,<br>
But qualify the fire&#8217;s extreme rage,<br>
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">The more thou damm&#8217;st it up, the more it
burns.<br>
The current that with gentle murmur glides,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st, being stopp&#8217;d, impatiently doth rage;<br>
But when his fair course is not hindered,<br>
He makes sweet music with the enamell&#8217;ed stones,<br>
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br>
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,<br>
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br>
With willing sport to the wild ocean.<br>
Then let me go and hinder not my course<br>
I&#8217;ll be as patient as a gentle stream<br>
And make a pastime of each weary step,<br>
Till the last step have brought me to my love;<br>
And there I&#8217;ll rest, as after much turmoil<br>
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">But in what habit will you go along?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not like a woman; for I would prevent<br>
The loose encounters of lascivious men:<br>
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds<br>
As may beseem some well-reputed page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">No, girl, I&#8217;ll knit it up in silken
strings<br>
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.<br>
To be fantastic may become a youth<br>
Of greater time than I shall show to be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">What fashion, madam shall I make your
breeches?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That fits as well as &#8216;Tell me, good my
lord,<br>
What compass will you wear your farthingale?&#8217;<br>
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">You must needs have them with a codpiece,
madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Out, out, Lucetta! that would be
ill-favour&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">A round hose, madam, now&#8217;s not worth a
pin,<br>
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have<br>
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.<br>
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me<br>
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?<br>
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">If you think so, then stay at home and go
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that I will not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Then never dream on infamy, but go.<br>
If Proteus like your journey when you come,<br>
No matter who&#8217;s displeased when you are gone:<br>
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:<br>
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears<br>
And instances of infinite of love<br>
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">All these are servants to deceitful men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Base men, that use them to so base effect!<br>
But truer stars did govern Proteus&#8217; birth<br>
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,<br>
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,<br>
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,<br>
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to
him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong<br>
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:<br>
Only deserve my love by loving him;<br>
And presently go with me to my chamber,<br>
To take a note of what I stand in need of,<br>
To furnish me upon my longing journey.<br>
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,<br>
My goods, my lands, my reputation;<br>
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.<br>
Come, answer not, but to it presently!<br>
I am impatient of my tarriance.</p>

Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;<br>
We have some secrets to confer about.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, tell me, Proteus, what&#8217;s your will
with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, that which I would discover<br>
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;<br>
But when I call to mind your gracious favours<br>
Done to me, undeserving as I am,<br>
My duty pricks me on to utter that<br>
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.<br>
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,<br>
This night intends to steal away your daughter:<br>
Myself am one made privy to the plot.<br>
I know you have determined to bestow her<br>
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;<br>
And should she thus be stol&#8217;n away from you,<br>
It would be much vexation to your age.<br>
Thus, for my duty&#8217;s sake, I rather chose<br>
To cross my friend in his intended drift<br>
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head<br>
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,<br>
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;<br>
Which to requite, command me while I live.<br>
This love of theirs myself have often seen,<br>
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,<br>
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid<br>
Sir Valentine her company and my court:<br>
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err<br>
And so unworthily disgrace the man,<br>
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn&#8217;d,<br>
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find<br>
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.<br>
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,<br>
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,<br>
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,<br>
The key whereof myself have ever kept;<br>
And thence she cannot be convey&#8217;d away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean<br>
How he her chamber-window will ascend<br>
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;<br>
For which the youthful lover now is gone<br>
And this way comes he with it presently;<br>
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.<br>
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly<br>
That my discovery be not aimed at;<br>
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,<br>
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, he shall never know<br>
That I had any light from thee of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Please it your grace, there is a messenger<br>
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,<br>
And I am going to deliver them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Be they of much import?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">The tenor of them doth but signify<br>
My health and happy being at your court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;<br>
I am to break with thee of some affairs<br>
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.<br>
&#8217;Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought<br>
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match<br>
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman<br>
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities<br>
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:<br>
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen,
froward,<br>
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,<br>
Neither regarding that she is my child<br>
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;<br>
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,<br>
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;<br>
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age<br>
Should have been cherish&#8217;d by her child-like duty,<br>
I now am full resolved to take a wife<br>
And turn her out to who will take her in:<br>
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;<br>
For me and my possessions she esteems not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">There is a lady in Verona here<br>
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy<br>
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:<br>
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor&#8212;<br>
For long agone I have forgot to court;<br>
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed&#8212;<br>
How and which way I may bestow myself<br>
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:<br>
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind<br>
More than quick words do move a woman&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">A woman sometimes scorns what best contents
her.<br>
Send her another; never give her o&#8217;er;<br>
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.<br>
If she do frown, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,<br>
But rather to beget more love in you:<br>
If she do chide, &#8217;tis not to have you gone;<br>
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.<br>
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;<br>
For &#8216;get you gone,&#8217; she doth not mean
&#8216;away!&#8217;<br>
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;<br>
Though ne&#8217;er so black, say they have angels&#8217; faces.<br>
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,<br>
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But she I mean is promised by her friends<br>
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,<br>
And kept severely from resort of men,<br>
That no man hath access by day to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but the doors be lock&#8217;d and keys kept
safe,<br>
That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What lets but one may enter at her window?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,<br>
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it<br>
Without apparent hazard of his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,<br>
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,<br>
Would serve to scale another Hero&#8217;s tower,<br>
So bold Leander would adventure it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,<br>
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This very night; for Love is like a child,<br>
That longs for every thing that he can come by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">By seven o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll get you such a
ladder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:<br>
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">It will be light, my lord, that you may bear
it<br>
Under a cloak that is of any length.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Then let me see thy cloak:<br>
I&#8217;ll get me one of such another length.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?<br>
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.<br>
What letter is this same? What&#8217;s here? &#8216;To
Silvia&#8217;!<br>
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.<br>
I&#8217;ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia
nightly,<br>
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:<br>
O, could their master come and go as lightly,<br>
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!<br>
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:<br>
While I, their king, that hither them importune,<br>
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless&#8217;d
them,<br>
Because myself do want my servants&#8217; fortune:<br>
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,<br>
That they should harbour where their lord would be.&#8217;<br>
What&#8217;s here?<br>
&#8216;Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.&#8217;<br>
&#8217;Tis so; and here&#8217;s the ladder for the purpose.<br>
Why, Phaeton,&#8212;for thou art Merops&#8217; son,&#8212;<br>
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car<br>
And with thy daring folly burn the world?<br>
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?<br>
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!<br>
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,<br>
And think my patience, more than thy desert,<br>
Is privilege for thy departure hence:<br>
Thank me for this more than for all the favours<br>
Which all too much I have bestow&#8217;d on thee.<br>
But if thou linger in my territories<br>
Longer than swiftest expedition<br>
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,<br>
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love<br>
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.<br>
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;<br>
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And why not death rather than living torment?<br>
To die is to be banish&#8217;d from myself;<br>
And Silvia is myself: banish&#8217;d from her<br>
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!<br>
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?<br>
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?<br>
Unless it be to think that she is by<br>
And feed upon the shadow of perfection<br>
Except I be by Silvia in the night,<br>
There is no music in the nightingale;<br>
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,<br>
There is no day for me to look upon;<br>
She is my essence, and I leave to be,<br>
If I be not by her fair influence<br>
Foster&#8217;d, illumined, cherish&#8217;d, kept alive.<br>
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:<br>
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:<br>
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.</p>

And now excess of it will make me surfeit.<br>
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?</p>

doom&#8212;<br>
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force&#8212;<br>
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:<br>
Those at her father&#8217;s churlish feet she tender&#8217;d;<br>
With them, upon her knees, her humble self;<br>
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them<br>
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:<br>
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,<br>
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,<br>
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;<br>
But Valentine, if he be ta&#8217;en, must die.<br>
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,<br>
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,<br>
That to close prison he commanded her,<br>
With many bitter threats of biding there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No more; unless the next word that thou
speak&#8217;st<br>
Have some malignant power upon my life:<br>
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,<br>
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,<br>
And study help for that which thou lament&#8217;st.<br>
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.<br>
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;<br>
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.<br>
Hope is a lover&#8217;s staff; walk hence with that<br>
And manage it against despairing thoughts.<br>
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;<br>
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver&#8217;d<br>

<p class="speech">I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit
to
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that&#8217;s
all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
&#8217;tis I love; and yet &#8217;tis a woman; but what woman,
I
will not tell myself; and yet &#8217;tis a milkmaid; yet
&#8217;tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet &#8217;tis
a maid, for she is her master&#8217;s maid, and serves for
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
which is much in a bare Christian.</p>

it. The
cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
less. What&#8217;s next?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>

<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that word makes the faults gracious.
Well,
I&#8217;ll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
impossible,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then will I tell thee&#8212;that thy master

better man than thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And must I go to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so
long
that going will scarce serve the turn.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love
you,<br>
Now Valentine is banish&#8217;d from her sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Since his exile she hath despised me most,<br>
Forsworn my company and rail&#8217;d at me,<br>
That I am desperate of obtaining her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This weak impress of love is as a figure<br>
Trenched in ice, which with an hour&#8217;s heat<br>
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.<br>
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts<br>
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman<br>
According to our proclamation gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Gone, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter takes his going grievously.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.<br>
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee&#8212;<br>
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert&#8212;<br>
Makes me the better to confer with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Longer than I prove loyal to your grace<br>
Let me not live to look upon your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st how willingly I would
effect<br>
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I do, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">And also, I think, thou art not ignorant<br>
How she opposes her against my will</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and perversely she persevers so.<br>
What might we do to make the girl forget<br>
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">The best way is to slander Valentine<br>
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,<br>
Three things that women highly hold in hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but she&#8217;ll think that it is spoke in
hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if his enemy deliver it:<br>
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken<br>
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Then you must undertake to slander him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:<br>
&#8217;Tis an ill office for a gentleman,<br>
Especially against his very friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Where your good word cannot advantage him,<br>
Your slander never can endamage him;<br>
Therefore the office is indifferent,<br>
Being entreated to it by your friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">You have prevail&#8217;d, my lord; if I can do
it<br>
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,<br>
She shall not long continue love to him.<br>
But say this weed her love from Valentine,<br>
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,<br>
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,<br>
You must provide to bottom it on me;<br>
Which must be done by praising me as much<br>
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,<br>
Because we know, on Valentine&#8217;s report,<br>
You are already Love&#8217;s firm votary<br>
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.<br>
Upon this warrant shall you have access<br>
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;<br>
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,<br>
And, for your friend&#8217;s sake, will be glad of you;<br>
Where you may temper her by your persuasion<br>
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">As much as I can do, I will effect:<br>
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;<br>
You must lay lime to tangle her desires<br>
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes<br>
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay,<br>
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Say that upon the altar of her beauty<br>
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:<br>
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears<br>
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line<br>
That may discover such integrity:<br>
For Orpheus&#8217; lute was strung with poets&#8217; sinews,<br>
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,<br>
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans<br>
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.<br>
After your dire-lamenting elegies,<br>
Visit by night your lady&#8217;s chamber-window<br>
With some sweet concert; to their instruments<br>
Tune a deploring dump: the night&#8217;s dead silence<br>
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.<br>
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">And thy advice this night I&#8217;ll put in
practise.<br>
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,<br>
Let us into the city presently<br>
To sort some gentlemen well skill&#8217;d in music.<br>
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn<br>
To give the onset to thy good advice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">About it, gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll wait upon your grace till after
supper,<br>
And afterward determine our proceedings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>

<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Who? Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, Silvia; for your sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,<br>
Let&#8217;s tune, and to it lustily awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, at a distance, Host,

<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my young guest, methinks you&#8217;re
allycholly: I
pray you, why is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Come, we&#8217;ll have you merry: I&#8217;ll
bring you where
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">But shall I hear him speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that you shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That will be music.</p>

<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ay: but, peace! let&#8217;s hear &#8217;em.<br>
Song.<br>
Who is Silvia? what is she,<br>
That all our swains commend her?<br>
Holy, fair and wise is she;<br>
The heaven such grace did lend her,<br>
That she might admired be.<br>
Is she kind as she is fair?<br>
For beauty lives with kindness.<br>
Love doth to her eyes repair,<br>
To help him of his blindness,<br>
And, being help&#8217;d, inhabits there.<br>
Then to Silvia let us sing,<br>
That Silvia is excelling;<br>
She excels each mortal thing<br>
Upon the dull earth dwelling:<br>
To her let us garlands bring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">How now! are you sadder than you were before?
How
do you, man? the music likes you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake; the musician likes me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Why, my pretty youth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">He plays false, father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">How? out of tune on the strings?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my
very
heart-strings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">You have a quick ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow
heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I perceive you delight not in music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, when it jars so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, what fine change is in the music!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that change is the spite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">You would have them always play but one
thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I would always have one play but one thing.<br>
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on<br>
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he
loved
her out of all nick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Where is Launce?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
master&#8217;s command, he must carry for a present to his
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! stand aside: the company parts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead<br>
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Where meet we?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At Saint Gregory&#8217;s well.</p>

<p class="speech">Madam, good even to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your music, gentlemen.<br>
Who is that that spake?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">One, lady, if you knew his pure heart&#8217;s
truth,<br>
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, as I take it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That I may compass yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">You have your wish; my will is even this:<br>
That presently you hie you home to bed.<br>
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!<br>
Think&#8217;st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,<br>
To be seduced by thy flattery,<br>
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?<br>
Return, return, and make thy love amends.<br>
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,<br>
I am so far from granting thy request<br>
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,<br>
And by and by intend to chide myself<br>
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;<br>
But she is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> &#8217;Twere
false, if I should speak it;<br>
For I am sure she is not buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend<br>
Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,<br>
I am betroth&#8217;d: and art thou not ashamed<br>
To wrong him with thy importunacy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">And so suppose am I; for in his grave<br>
Assure thyself my love is buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Go to thy lady&#8217;s grave and call hers
thence,<br>
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He heard not
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,<br>
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,<br>
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;<br>
To that I&#8217;ll speak, to that I&#8217;ll sigh and weep:<br>
For since the substance of your perfect self<br>
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;<br>
And to your shadow will I make true love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If
&#8217;twere a substance, you would, sure,
deceive it,
And make it but a shadow, as I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I am very loath to be your idol, sir;<br>
But since your falsehood shall become you well<br>
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,<br>
Send to me in the morning and I&#8217;ll send it:<br>
And so, good rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>

Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not&#8212;<br>
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish&#8217;d:<br>
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will<br>
I bear unto the banish&#8217;d Valentine,<br>
Nor how my father would enforce me marry<br>
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.<br>
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say<br>
No grief did ever come so near thy heart<br>
As when thy lady and thy true love died,<br>
Upon whose grave thou vow&#8217;dst pure chastity.<br>
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,<br>
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;<br>
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,<br>
I do desire thy worthy company,<br>
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.<br>
Urge not my father&#8217;s anger, Eglamour,<br>
But think upon my grief, a lady&#8217;s grief,<br>
And on the justice of my flying hence,<br>
To keep me from a most unholy match,<br>
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.<br>
I do desire thee, even from a heart<br>
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,<br>
To bear me company and go with me:<br>
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,<br>
That I may venture to depart alone.</p>

<div id="act4.4" class="scene" title="Scene IV. The same.">
<h4>Scene IV. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Launce, with his his
Dog</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur
with him,
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
&#8216;thus I would teach a dog.&#8217; I was sent to deliver
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg:
O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
I think verily he had been hanged for&#8217;t; sure as I
live, he had suffered for&#8217;t; you shall judge. He
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke&#8217;s table: he had
not been there&#8212;bless the mark!&#8212;a pissing while, but
all the chamber smelt him. &#8216;Out with the dog!&#8217; says
one: &#8216;What cur is that?&#8217; says another: &#8216;Whip
him
out&#8217; says the third: &#8216;Hang him up&#8217; says the
duke.
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs: &#8216;Friend,&#8217; quoth I, &#8216;you mean to
whip
the dog?&#8217; &#8216;Ay, marry, do I,&#8217; quoth he. &#8216;You
do him
the more wrong,&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;&#8217;twas I did the thing
you
wot of.&#8217; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for&#8217;t.
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus and
Julia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well<br>
And will employ thee in some service presently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>

<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I hope thou wilt.</p>

<p class="speech">How now, you whoreson peasant!<br>
Where have you been these two days loitering?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you
bade me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And what says she to my little jewel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells
you
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But she received my dog?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought
him
back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What, didst thou offer her this from me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me
by
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,<br>
Or ne&#8217;er return again into my sight.<br>
Away, I say! stay&#8217;st thou to vex me here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Launce</span></p>
<p class="speech">A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!<br>
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,<br>
Partly that I have need of such a youth<br>
That can with some discretion do my business,<br>
For &#8217;tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,<br>
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,<br>
Which, if my augury deceive me not,<br>
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:<br>
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.<br>
Go presently and take this ring with thee,<br>
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:<br>
She loved me well deliver&#8217;d it to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">It seems you loved not her, to leave her
token.<br>
She is dead, belike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; I think she lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou cry &#8216;alas&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot choose<br>
But pity her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Wherefore shouldst thou pity
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Because methinks that she loved you as well<br>
As you do love your lady Silvia:<br>
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;<br>
You dote on her that cares not for your love.<br>
&#8217;Tis pity love should be so contrary;<br>
And thinking of it makes me cry &#8216;alas!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, give her that ring and therewithal<br>
This letter. That&#8217;s her chamber. Tell my lady<br>
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.<br>
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,<br>
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">How many women would do such a message?<br>
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain&#8217;d<br>
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.<br>
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him<br>
That with his very heart despiseth me?<br>
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;<br>
Because I love him I must pity him.<br>
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,<br>
To bind him to remember my good will;<br>
And now am I, unhappy messenger,<br>
To plead for that which I would not obtain,<br>
To carry that which I would have refused,<br>
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.<br>
I am my master&#8217;s true-confirmed love;<br>
But cannot be true servant to my master,<br>
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.<br>
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly<br>
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Silvia,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean<br>
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What would you with her, if that I be she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">If you be she, I do entreat your patience<br>
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">From whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O, he sends you for a picture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Ursula, bring my picture here.<br>
Go give your master this: tell him from me,<br>
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,<br>
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, please you peruse this letter.&#8212;<br>
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised<br>
Deliver&#8217;d you a paper that I should not:<br>
This is the letter to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, let me look on that again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">There, hold!<br>
I will not look upon your master&#8217;s lines:<br>
I know they are stuff&#8217;d with protestations<br>
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break<br>
As easily as I do tear his paper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">The more shame for him that he sends it me;<br>
For I have heard him say a thousand times<br>
His Julia gave it him at his departure.<br>
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,<br>
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">She thanks you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, madam, that you tender her.<br>
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou know her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Almost as well as I do know myself:<br>
To think upon her woes I do protest<br>
That I have wept a hundred several times.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I think she doth; and that&#8217;s her cause of
sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not passing fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:<br>
When she did think my master loved her well,<br>
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:<br>
But since she did neglect her looking-glass<br>
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,<br>
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks<br>
And pinch&#8217;d the lily-tincture of her face,<br>
That now she is become as black as I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">How tall was she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">About my stature; for at Pentecost,<br>
When all our pageants of delight were play&#8217;d,<br>
Our youth got me to play the woman&#8217;s part,<br>
And I was trimm&#8217;d in Madam Julia&#8217;s gown,<br>
Which served me as fit, by all men&#8217;s judgments,<br>
As if the garment had been made for me:<br>
Therefore I know she is about my height.<br>
And at that time I made her weep agood,<br>
For I did play a lamentable part:<br>
Madam, &#8217;twas Ariadne passioning<br>
For Theseus&#8217; perjury and unjust flight;<br>
Which I so lively acted with my tears<br>
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,<br>
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead<br>
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.<br>
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!<br>
I weep myself to think upon thy words.<br>
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this<br>
For thy sweet mistress&#8217; sake, because thou lovest her.<br>
Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Silvia, with
attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And she shall thank you for&#8217;t, if
e&#8217;er you know her.<br>
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful<br>
I hope my master&#8217;s suit will be but cold,<br>
Since she respects my mistress&#8217; love so much.<br>
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!<br>
Here is her picture: let me see; I think,<br>
If I had such a tire, this face of mine<br>
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:<br>
And yet the painter flatter&#8217;d her a little,<br>
Unless I flatter with myself too much.<br>
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:<br>
If that be all the difference in his love,<br>
I&#8217;ll get me such a colour&#8217;d periwig.<br>
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:<br>
Ay, but her forehead&#8217;s low, and mine&#8217;s as high.<br>
What should it be that he respects in her<br>
But I can make respective in myself,<br>
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?<br>
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,<br>
For &#8217;tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,<br>
Thou shalt be worshipp&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, loved and adored!<br>
And, were there sense in his idolatry,<br>
My substance should be statue in thy stead.<br>
I&#8217;ll use thee kindly for thy mistress&#8217; sake,<br>
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,<br>
I should have scratch&#8217;d out your unseeing eyes<br>
To make my master out of love with thee!</p>

<p class="speech">Why then,<br>
She&#8217;s fled unto that peasant Valentine;<br>
And Eglamour is in her company.<br>
&#8217;Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,<br>
As he in penance wander&#8217;d through the forest;<br>
Him he knew well, and guess&#8217;d that it was she,<br>
But, being mask&#8217;d, he was not sure of it;<br>
Besides, she did intend confession<br>
At Patrick&#8217;s cell this even; and there she was not;<br>
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.<br>
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,<br>
But mount you presently and meet with me<br>
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot<br>
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:<br>
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</p>

<p class="speech">How use doth breed a habit in a man!<br>
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,<br>
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:<br>
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,<br>
And to the nightingale&#8217;s complaining notes<br>
Tune my distresses and record my woes.<br>
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,<br>
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,<br>
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall<br>
And leave no memory of what it was!<br>
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;<br>
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!<br>
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?<br>
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,<br>
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.<br>
They love me well; yet I have much to do<br>
To keep them from uncivil outrages.<br>
Withdraw thee, Valentine: who&#8217;s this comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus, Silvia, and
Julia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, this service I have done for you,<br>
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,<br>
To hazard life and rescue you from him<br>
That would have forced your honour and your love;<br>
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;<br>
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg<br>
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How like a
dream is this I see and hear!<br>
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O miserable, unhappy that I am!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;<br>
But by my coming I have made you happy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And me, when
he approacheth to your presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Had I been seized by a hungry lion,<br>
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,<br>
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.<br>
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,<br>
Whose life&#8217;s as tender to me as my soul!<br>
And full as much, for more there cannot be,<br>
I do detest false perjured Proteus.<br>
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What dangerous action, stood it next to
death,<br>
Would I not undergo for one calm look!<br>
O, &#8217;tis the curse in love, and still approved,<br>
When women cannot love where they&#8217;re beloved!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">When Proteus cannot love where he&#8217;s
beloved.<br>
Read over Julia&#8217;s heart, thy first best love,<br>
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith<br>
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths<br>
Descended into perjury, to love me.<br>
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou&#8217;dst two;<br>
And that&#8217;s far worse than none; better have none<br>
Than plural faith which is too much by one:<br>
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!</p>

Who respects friend?</p>

Can no way change you to a milder form,<br>
I&#8217;ll woo you like a soldier, at arms&#8217; end,<br>
And love you &#8217;gainst the nature of love,&#8212;force ye.</p>

<p class="speech">Valentine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Thou common friend, that&#8217;s without faith or
love,<br>
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!<br>
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye<br>
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say<br>
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.<br>
Who should be trusted, when one&#8217;s own right hand<br>
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,<br>
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,<br>
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.<br>
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,<br>
&#8217;Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My shame and guilt confounds me.<br>
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow<br>
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,<br>
I tender &#8217;t here; I do as truly suffer<br>
As e&#8217;er I did commit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Then I am paid;<br>
And once again I do receive thee honest.<br>
Who by repentance is not satisfied<br>
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.<br>
By penitence the Eternal&#8217;s wrath&#8217;s appeased:<br>
And, that my love may appear plain and free,<br>
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</p>

matter?<br>

ring

<p class="speech">O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:<br>
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But how camest thou by this ring? At my
depart<br>
I gave this unto Julia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And Julia herself did give it me;<br>
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">How! Julia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,<br>
And entertain&#8217;d &#8217;em deeply in her heart.<br>
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!<br>
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!<br>
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me<br>
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live<br>
In a disguise of love:<br>
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,<br>
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Than men their minds! &#8217;tis true.<br>
O heaven! were man<br>
But constant, he were perfect. That one error<br>
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:<br>
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.<br>
What is in Silvia&#8217;s face, but I may spy<br>
More fresh in Julia&#8217;s with a constant eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, a hand from either:<br>
Let me be blest to make this happy close;<br>
&#8217;Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</p>

That you will wonder what hath fortuned.<br>
Come, Proteus; &#8217;tis your penance but to hear<br>
