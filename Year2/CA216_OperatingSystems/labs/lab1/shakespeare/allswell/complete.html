<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p class="note">[from Wikipedia]</p>
<p><em>All's Well That Ends Well</em>
was probably written later in Shakespeare's career, between
1601 and 1608.

<p>The five acts follow the action of Helena, a lowborn beauty, who pines
for the son of her guardian, Count Bertram. She is granted his hand as a
reward for curing the King, but Bertram runs away to war, declaring
&#8220;When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten of thy body that
I am father to, then call me husband.&#8221;
Helena tricks him into giving her his
family ring and sleeping with her, by posing as Diana, the virginal
daughter of a widow. These were his conditions for being her true
husband and he agrees to be a good husband in the final act.

<p>Shakespeare's source is most likely a story in William Painter's The
Palace of Pleasure, which was in fact a translation of <a href=
"http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/boccaccio/giovanni/b664d/dec34.html">the ninth story</a>
from the third day of Boccaccio's Decameron.</p>

<h3>ACT I</h3>

"SCENE I. Rousillon. The Count&#8217;s palace.">
<h4>SCENE I. Rousillon. The Count&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bertram, the Countess
of Rousillon, Helena, and Lafeu, all in black</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">In delivering my son from me, I bury a second
husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">And I in going, madam, weep o&#8217;er my
father&#8217;s death anew: but I must attend his majesty&#8217;s
command, to whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times good must of
necessity hold his virtue to you; whose worthiness would stir it up
where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such
abundance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">What hope is there of his majesty&#8217;s
amendment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under
whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and finds no
other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by
time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">This young gentlewoman had a father,&#8212;O,
that &#8216;had&#8217;! how sad a passage &#8217;tis!&#8212;whose
skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far,
would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for
lack of work. Would, for the king&#8217;s sake, he were living! I
think it would be the death of the king&#8217;s disease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">How called you the man you speak of, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful
enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against
mortality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">What is it, my good lord, the king languishes
of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">A fistula, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I heard not of it before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were not notorious. Was this
gentlewoman the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education
promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts
fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in
her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her
honesty and achieves her goodness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Your commendations, madam, get from her
tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the best brine a maiden can season her
praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart
but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek.
No more of this, Helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought
you affect a sorrow than have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive grief the enemy to the living.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
makes it soon mortal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I desire your holy wishes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">How understand we that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy
father<br>
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue<br>
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness<br>
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,<br>
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy<br>
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend<br>
Under thy own life&#8217;s key: be cheque&#8217;d for silence,<br>
But never tax&#8217;d for speech. What heaven more will,<br>
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,<br>
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;<br>
&#8217;Tis an unseason&#8217;d courtier; good my lord,<br>
Advise him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He cannot want the best<br>
That shall attend his love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Helena]</span> The best
wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! Be
comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit
of your father.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Bertram and
Lafeu</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O, were that all! I think not on my father;<br>
And these great tears grace his remembrance more<br>
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?<br>
I have forgot him: my imagination<br>
Carries no favour in&#8217;t but Bertram&#8217;s.<br>
I am undone: there is no living, none,<br>
If Bertram be away. &#8217;Twere all one<br>
That I should love a bright particular star<br>
And think to wed it, he is so above me:<br>
In his bright radiance and collateral light<br>
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.<br>
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:<br>
The hind that would be mated by the lion<br>
Must die for love. &#8217;Twas pretty, though plague,<br>
To see him every hour; to sit and draw<br>
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,<br>
In our heart&#8217;s table; heart too capable<br>
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:<br>
But now he&#8217;s gone, and my idolatrous fancy<br>
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Parolles</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> One that goes
with him: I love him for his sake;<br>
And yet I know him a notorious liar,<br>
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;<br>
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,<br>
That they take place, when virtue&#8217;s steely bones<br>
Look bleak i&#8217; the cold wind: withal, full oft we see<br>
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Save you, fair queen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">And you, monarch!</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">And no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Are you meditating on virginity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado
it against him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Keep him out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">But he assails; and our virginity, though
valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike
resistance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
undermine you and blow you up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up
men?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach
yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the
commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is
rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was
first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins.
Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever
kept, it is ever lost: &#8217;tis too cold a companion; away with
&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">I will stand for &#8217;t a little, though
therefore I die a virgin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s little can be said in &#8217;t;
&#8217;tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of
virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders
itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified
limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds
mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and
so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is
peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most
inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but
loose by&#8217;t: out with &#8217;t! within ten year it will make
itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself
not much the worse: away with &#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own
liking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that
ne&#8217;er it likes. &#8217;Tis a commodity will lose the gloss
with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with &#8217;t
while &#8217;tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity,
like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited,
but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear
not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in
your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of
our French withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
&#8217;tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet
&#8217;tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Not my virginity yet.<br>
There shall your master have a thousand loves,<br>
A mother and a mistress and a friend,<br>
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,<br>
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,<br>
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;<br>
His humble ambition, proud humility,<br>
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,<br>
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world<br>
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,<br>
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he&#8212;<br>
I know not what he shall. God send him well!<br>
The court&#8217;s a learning place, and he is one&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">What one, i&#8217; faith?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">That I wish well. &#8217;Tis pity&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s pity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">That wishing well had not a body in&#8217;t,<br>
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,<br>
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,<br>
Might with effects of them follow our friends,<br>
And show what we alone must think, which never<br>
Return us thanks.</p>

<p class="speech">Why under Mars?</p>

<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">When he was retrograde, I think, rather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Why think you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">You go so much backward when you fight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s for advantage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">So is running away, when fear proposes the
safety; but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you
is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the which, my
instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable
of a courtier&#8217;s counsel and understand what advice shall
thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When thou hast leisure,
say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends; get
thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.</p>

Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky<br>
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull<br>
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.<br>
What power is it which mounts my love so high,<br>
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?<br>
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings<br>
To join like likes and kiss like native things.<br>
Impossible be strange attempts to those<br>
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose<br>
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove<br>
So show her merit, that did miss her love?<br>
The king&#8217;s disease&#8212;my project may deceive me,<br>

Clock to itself, knew the true minute when<br>
Exception bid him speak, and at this time<br>
His tongue obey&#8217;d his hand: who were below him<br>
He used as creatures of another place<br>
And bow&#8217;d his eminent top to their low ranks,<br>
Making them proud of his humility,<br>
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man<br>
Might be a copy to these younger times;<br>
Which, follow&#8217;d well, would demonstrate them now<br>
But goers backward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">His good remembrance, sir,<br>
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;<br>
So in approof lives not his epitaph<br>
As in your royal speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Would I were with him! He would always
say&#8212;<br>
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words<br>
He scatter&#8217;d not in ears, but grafted them,<br>
To grow there and to bear,&#8212;&#8216;Let me not
live,&#8217;&#8212;<br>
This his good melancholy oft began,<br>
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,<br>
When it was out,&#8212;&#8216;Let me not live,&#8217; quoth he,<br>
&#8216;After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff<br>
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses<br>
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are<br>
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies<br>
Expire before their fashions.&#8217; This he wish&#8217;d;<br>
I after him do after him wish too,<br>
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,<br>
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,<br>
To give some labourers room.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">You are loved, sir:<br>
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">I fill a place, I know&#8217;t. How long
is&#8217;t, count,<br>
Since the physician at your father&#8217;s died?<br>
He was much famed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Some six months since, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">If he were living, I would try him yet.<br>
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out<br>
With several applications; nature and sickness<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Countess, Steward, and
Clown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">I will now hear; what say you of this
gentlewoman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Steward</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, the care I have had to even your content,
I wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for
then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our
deservings, when of ourselves we publish them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all believe: &#8217;tis
my slowness that I do not; for I know you lack not folly to commit
them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor
fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam, &#8217;tis not so well that I am poor,
though many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have your
ladyship&#8217;s good will to go to the world, Isbel the woman and
I will do as we may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou needs be a beggar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I do beg your good will in this case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">In what case?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">In Isbel&#8217;s case and mine own. Service is no
heritage: and I think I shall never have the blessing of God till I
have issue o&#8217; my body; for they say barnes are blessings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Is this all your worship&#8217;s reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as
they are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">May the world know them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry that I may
repent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I am out o&#8217; friends, madam; and I hope to
have friends for my wife&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Such friends are thine enemies, knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re shallow, madam, in great friends;
for the knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of. He that
ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if I
be his cuckold, he&#8217;s my drudge: he that comforts my wife is
the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and
blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is
my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. If men could
be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the Papist,
howsome&#8217;er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads
are both one; they may jowl horns together, like any deer i&#8217;
the herd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious
knave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the
next way:<br>
For I the ballad will repeat,<br>
Which men full true shall find;<br>
Your marriage comes by destiny,<br>
Your cuckoo sings by kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Get you gone, sir; I&#8217;ll talk with you more
anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Steward</p>
<p class="speech">May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come
to you: of her I am to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with
her; Helen, I mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Was this fair face the cause, quoth
she,<br>
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?<br>
Fond done, done fond,<br>
Was this King Priam&#8217;s joy?<br>
With that she sighed as she stood,<br>
With that she sighed as she stood,<br>
And gave this sentence then;<br>
Among nine bad if one be good,<br>
Among nine bad if one be good,<br>
There&#8217;s yet one good in ten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song,
sirrah.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">One good woman in ten, madam; which is a
purifying o&#8217; the song: would God would serve the world so all
the year! we&#8217;ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if I were
the parson. One in ten, quoth a&#8217;! An we might have a good
woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake,
&#8217;twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out,
ere a&#8217; pluck one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll be gone, sir knave, and do as I
command you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">That man should be at woman&#8217;s command, and
yet no hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no
hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of
a big heart. I am going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to
come hither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Well, now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Steward</p>
<p class="speech">I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman
entirely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as
much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid; and
more shall be paid her than she&#8217;ll demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Steward</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her
own words to her own ears; she thought, I dare vow for her, they
touched not any stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference
betwixt their two estates; Love no god, that would not extend his
might, only where qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins,
that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the
first assault or ransom afterward. This she delivered in the most
bitter touch of sorrow that e&#8217;er I heard virgin exclaim in:
which I held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in
the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung
so tottering in the balance that I could neither believe nor
misdoubt. Pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank
you for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Steward</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Helena</span></p>
<p class="speech">Even so it was with me when I was young:<br>
If ever we are nature&#8217;s, these are ours; this thorn<br>
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;<br>
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;<br>
It is the show and seal of nature&#8217;s truth,<br>
Where love&#8217;s strong passion is impress&#8217;d in youth:<br>
By our remembrances of days foregone,<br>
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.<br>
Her eye is sick on&#8217;t: I observe her now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">What is your pleasure, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">You know, Helen, I am a mother to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Mine honourable mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, a mother:<br>
Why not a mother? When I said &#8216;a mother,&#8217;<br>
Methought you saw a serpent: what&#8217;s in
&#8217;mother,&#8217;<br>
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;<br>
And put you in the catalogue of those<br>
That were enwombed mine: &#8217;tis often seen<br>
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds<br>
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:<br>
You ne&#8217;er oppress&#8217;d me with a mother&#8217;s groan,<br>
Yet I express to you a mother&#8217;s care:<br>
God&#8217;s mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood<br>
To say I am thy mother? What&#8217;s the matter,<br>
That this distemper&#8217;d messenger of wet,<br>
The many-colour&#8217;d Iris, rounds thine eye?<br>
Why? that you are my daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">That I am not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">I say, I am your mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, madam;<br>
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:<br>
I am from humble, he from honour&#8217;d name;<br>
No note upon my parents, his all noble:<br>
My master, my dear lord he is; and I<br>
His servant live, and will his vassal die:<br>
He must not be my brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I your mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">You are my mother, madam; would you
were,&#8212;<br>
So that my lord your son were not my brother,&#8212;<br>
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,<br>
I care no more for than I do for heaven,<br>
So I were not his sister. Can&#8217;t no other,<br>
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:<br>
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother<br>
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?<br>
My fear hath catch&#8217;d your fondness: now I see<br>
The mystery of your loneliness, and find<br>
Your salt tears&#8217; head: now to all sense &#8217;tis gross<br>
You love my son; invention is ashamed,<br>
Against the proclamation of thy passion,<br>
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;<br>
But tell me then, &#8217;tis so; for, look thy cheeks<br>
Confess it, th&#8217; one to th&#8217; other; and thine eyes<br>
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors<br>
That in their kind they speak it: only sin<br>
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,<br>
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is&#8217;t so?<br>
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;<br>
If it be not, forswear&#8217;t: howe&#8217;er, I charge thee,<br>
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,<br>
Tell me truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Good madam, pardon me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Do you love my son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Your pardon, noble mistress!</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Love you my son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do not you love him, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Go not about; my love hath in&#8217;t a bond,<br>
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose<br>
The state of your affection; for your passions<br>
Have to the full appeach&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Then, I confess,<br>
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,<br>
That before you, and next unto high heaven,<br>
I love your son.<br>
My friends were poor, but honest; so&#8217;s my love:<br>
Be not offended; for it hurts not him<br>
That he is loved of me: I follow him not<br>
By any token of presumptuous suit;<br>
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;<br>
Yet never know how that desert should be.<br>
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;<br>
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve<br>
I still pour in the waters of my love<br>
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,<br>
Religious in mine error, I adore<br>
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,<br>
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,<br>
Let not your hate encounter with my love<br>
For loving where you do: but if yourself,<br>
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,<br>
Did ever in so true a flame of liking<br>
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian<br>
Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity<br>
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose<br>
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;<br>
That seeks not to find that her search implies,<br>
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Had you not lately an intent,&#8212;speak
truly,&#8212;<br>
To go to Paris?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Madam, I had.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore? tell true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.<br>
You know my father left me some prescriptions<br>
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading<br>
And manifest experience had collected<br>
For general sovereignty; and that he will&#8217;d me<br>
In heedfull&#8217;st reservation to bestow them,<br>
As notes whose faculties inclusive were<br>
More than they were in note: amongst the rest,<br>
There is a remedy, approved, set down,<br>
To cure the desperate languishings whereof<br>
The king is render&#8217;d lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">This was your motive<br>
For Paris, was it? speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">My lord your son made me to think of this;<br>
Else Paris and the medicine and the king<br>
Had from the conversation of my thoughts<br>
Haply been absent then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">But think you, Helen,<br>
If you should tender your supposed aid,<br>
He would receive it? he and his physicians<br>
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,<br>
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit<br>
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,<br>
Embowell&#8217;d of their doctrine, have left off<br>
The danger to itself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s something in&#8217;t,<br>
More than my father&#8217;s skill, which was the greatest<br>
Of his profession, that his good receipt<br>
Shall for my legacy be sanctified<br>
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour<br>
But give me leave to try success, I&#8217;ld venture<br>
The well-lost life of mine on his grace&#8217;s cure<br>
By such a day and hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou believe&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, knowingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and
love,<br>
Means and attendants and my loving greetings<br>
To those of mine in court: I&#8217;ll stay at home<br>
And pray God&#8217;s blessing into thy attempt:<br>
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,<br>
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.</p>

<p class="speech">Good faith, across: but, my good lord &#8217;tis
thus;<br>
Will you be cured of your infirmity?</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?<br>
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if<br>
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine<br>
That&#8217;s able to breathe life into a stone,<br>
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary<br>
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,<br>
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,<br>
To give great Charlemain a pen in&#8217;s hand,<br>
And write to her a love-line.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">What &#8216;her&#8217; is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Doctor She: my lord, there&#8217;s one
arrived,<br>
If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,<br>
If seriously I may convey my thoughts<br>
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke<br>
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,<br>
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more<br>
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her<br>
For that is her demand, and know her business?<br>
That done, laugh well at me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Now, good Lafeu,<br>
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee<br>
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine<br>
By wondering how thou took&#8217;st it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll fit you,<br>
And not be all day neither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lafeu, with
Helena</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come your ways.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">This haste hath wings indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come your ways:<br>
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:<br>
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors<br>
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid&#8217;s uncle,<br>
That dare leave two together; fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Now, fair one, does your business follow us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.<br>
Gerard de Narbon was my father;<br>
In what he did profess, well found.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">I knew him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">The rather will I spare my praises towards
him:<br>
Knowing him is enough. On&#8217;s bed of death<br>
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.<br>
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,<br>
And of his old experience the oily darling,<br>
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,<br>
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;<br>
And hearing your high majesty is touch&#8217;d<br>
With that malignant cause wherein the honour<br>
Of my dear father&#8217;s gift stands chief in power,<br>
I come to tender it and my appliance<br>
With all bound humbleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">We thank you, maiden;<br>
But may not be so credulous of cure,<br>
When our most learned doctors leave us and<br>
The congregated college have concluded<br>
That labouring art can never ransom nature<br>
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not<br>
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,<br>
To prostitute our past-cure malady<br>
To empirics, or to dissever so<br>
Our great self and our credit, to esteem<br>
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">My duty then shall pay me for my pains:<br>
I will no more enforce mine office on you.<br>
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts<br>
A modest one, to bear me back a again.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot give thee less, to be call&#8217;d
grateful:<br>
Thou thought&#8217;st to help me; and such thanks I give<br>
As one near death to those that wish him live:<br>
But what at full I know, thou know&#8217;st no part,<br>
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">What I can do can do no hurt to try,<br>
Since you set up your rest &#8217;gainst remedy.<br>
He that of greatest works is finisher<br>
Oft does them by the weakest minister:<br>
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,<br>
When judges have been babes; great floods have flown<br>
From simple sources, and great seas have dried<br>
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.<br>
Oft expectation fails and most oft there<br>
Where most it promises, and oft it hits<br>
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind
maid;<br>
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:<br>
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Inspired merit so by breath is barr&#8217;d:<br>
It is not so with Him that all things knows<br>
As &#8217;tis with us that square our guess by shows;<br>
But most it is presumption in us when<br>
The help of heaven we count the act of men.<br>
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;<br>
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.<br>
I am not an impostor that proclaim<br>
Myself against the level of mine aim;<br>
But know I think and think I know most sure<br>
My art is not past power nor you past cure.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Are thou so confident? within what space<br>
Hopest thou my cure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">The great&#8217;st grace lending grace<br>
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring<br>
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,<br>
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp<br>
Moist Hesperus hath quench&#8217;d his sleepy lamp,<br>
Or four and twenty times the pilot&#8217;s glass<br>
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,<br>
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,<br>
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Upon thy certainty and confidence<br>
What darest thou venture?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Tax of impudence,<br>
A strumpet&#8217;s boldness, a divulged shame<br>
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden&#8217;s name<br>
Sear&#8217;d otherwise; nay, worse&#8212;if
worse&#8212;extended<br>
With vilest torture let my life be ended.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth
speak<br>
His powerful sound within an organ weak:<br>
And what impossibility would slay<br>
In common sense, sense saves another way.<br>
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate<br>
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,<br>
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all<br>
That happiness and prime can happy call:<br>
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate<br>
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.<br>
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,<br>
That ministers thine own death if I die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">If I break time, or flinch in property<br>
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,<br>
And well deserved: not helping, death&#8217;s my fee;<br>
But, if I help, what do you promise me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Make thy demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But will you make it even?</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand<br>
What husband in thy power I will command:<br>
Exempted be from me the arrogance<br>
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,<br>
My low and humble name to propagate<br>
With any branch or image of thy state;<br>
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know<br>
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Here is my hand; the premises observed,<br>
Thy will by my performance shall be served:<br>
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,<br>
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.<br>
More should I question thee, and more I must,<br>
Though more to know could not be more to trust,<br>
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest<br>
Unquestion&#8217;d welcome and undoubted blest.<br>
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed<br>
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.</p>

Clown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height
of your breeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
know my business is but to the court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">To the court! why, what place make you special,
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners,
he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put
off&#8217;s cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg,
hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely,
were not for the court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that&#8217;s a bountiful answer that fits
all questions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">It is like a barber&#8217;s chair that fits all
buttocks, the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock,
or any buttock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Will your answer serve fit to all questions?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an
attorney, as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as
Tib&#8217;s rush for Tom&#8217;s forefinger, as a pancake for
Shrove Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his hole, the
cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave, as
the nun&#8217;s lip to the friar&#8217;s mouth, nay, as the pudding
to his skin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for
all questions?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">From below your duke to beneath your constable,
it will fit any question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the
learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs
to&#8217;t. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to
learn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool
in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I pray you,
sir, are you a courtier?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! There&#8217;s a simple putting off.
More, more, a hundred of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely
meat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to&#8217;t, I warrant
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! spare not me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Do you cry, &#8216;O Lord, sir!&#8217; at your
whipping, and &#8216;spare not me?&#8217; Indeed your &#8216;O
Lord, sir!&#8217; is very sequent to your whipping: you would
answer very well to a whipping, if you were but bound
to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I ne&#8217;er had worse luck in my life in my
&#8216;O Lord, sir!&#8217; I see things may serve long, but not
serve ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">I play the noble housewife with the time<br>
To entertain&#8217;t so merrily with a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! why, there&#8217;t serves well
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen
this,<br>
And urge her to a present answer back:<br>
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:<br>
This is not much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Not much commendation to them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Not much employment for you: you understand
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.</p>

Parolles</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">They say miracles are past; and we have our
philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar, things
supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that we make trifles of
terrors, ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge, when we
should submit ourselves to an unknown fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis the rarest argument of wonder
that hath shot out in our latter times.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>

<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Not to be helped,&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I may truly say, it is a novelty to the
world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing,
you shall read it in&#8212;what do you call there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly
actor.</p>

<p class="speech">My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your

<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>

Must answer for your raising? I know her well:<br>
She had her breeding at my father&#8217;s charge.<br>
A poor physician&#8217;s daughter my wife! Disdain<br>
Rather corrupt me ever!</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis only title thou disdain&#8217;st in
her, the which<br>
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,<br>
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour&#8217;d all together,<br>
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off<br>
In differences so mighty. If she be<br>
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,<br>
A poor physician&#8217;s daughter, thou dislikest<br>
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:<br>
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,<br>
The place is dignified by the doer&#8217;s deed:<br>
Where great additions swell&#8217;s, and virtue none,<br>
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone<br>
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:<br>
The property by what it is should go,<br>
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;<br>
In these to nature she&#8217;s immediate heir,<br>
And these breed honour: that is honour&#8217;s scorn,<br>
Which challenges itself as honour&#8217;s born<br>
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,<br>
When rather from our acts we them derive<br>
Than our foregoers: the mere word&#8217;s a slave<br>
Debosh&#8217;d on every tomb, on every grave<br>
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb<br>
Where dust and damn&#8217;d oblivion is the tomb<br>
Of honour&#8217;d bones indeed. What should be said?<br>
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,<br>
I can create the rest: virtue and she<br>
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot love her, nor will strive to
do&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wrong&#8217;st thyself, if thou shouldst
strive to choose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">That you are well restored, my lord, I&#8217;m
glad:<br>
Let the rest go.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">My honour&#8217;s at the stake; which to
defeat,<br>
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,<br>
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;<br>
That dost in vile misprision shackle up<br>
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,<br>
We, poising us in her defective scale,<br>
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,<br>
It is in us to plant thine honour where<br>
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:<br>
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:<br>
Believe not thy disdain, but presently<br>
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right<br>
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;<br>
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever<br>
Into the staggers and the careless lapse<br>
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate<br>
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,<br>
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit<br>
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider<br>
What great creation and what dole of honour<br>
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late<br>
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now<br>
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,<br>
Is as &#8217;twere born so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Take her by the hand,<br>
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise<br>
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate<br>
A balance more replete.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I take her hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Good fortune and the favour of the king<br>
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony<br>
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,<br>
And be perform&#8217;d to-night: the solemn feast<br>
Shall more attend upon the coming space,<br>
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,<br>
Thy love&#8217;s to me religious; else, does err.</p>

<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Your pleasure, sir?</p>

<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; is it not a language I speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">A most harsh one, and not to be understood
without bloody succeeding. My master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">To any count, to all counts, to what is man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">To what is count&#8217;s man: count&#8217;s
master is of another style.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are
too old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
title age cannot bring thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">What I dare too well do, I dare not do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a
pretty wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel;
it might pass: yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did
manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a
burthen. I have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care not:
yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and that thou&#8217;t
scarce worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon
thee,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
hasten thy trial; which if&#8212;Lord have mercy on thee for a hen!
So, my good window of lattice, fare thee well: thy casement I need
not open, for I look through thee. Give me thy hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you give me most egregious
indignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I have not, my lord, deserved it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
bate thee a scruple.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I shall be wiser.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull
at a smack o&#8217; the contrary. If ever thou be&#8217;st bound in
thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy
bondage. I have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee, or
rather my knowledge, that I may say in the default, he is a man I
know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you do me most insupportable
vexation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my
poor doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by thee, in what
motion age will give me leave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace
off me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must be patient;
there is no fettering of authority. I&#8217;ll beat him, by my
life, if I can meet him with any convenience, an he were double and
double a lord. I&#8217;ll have no more pity of his age than I would
of&#8212;I&#8217;ll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.</p>

<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>

some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good lord: whom I serve
above is my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Who? God?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">The devil it is that&#8217;s thy master. Why dost
thou garter up thy arms o&#8217; this fashion? dost make hose of
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set thy lower part
where thy nose stands. By mine honour, if I were but two hours
younger, I&#8217;ld beat thee: methinks, thou art a general
offence, and every man should beat thee: I think thou wast created
for men to breathe themselves upon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking
a kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and no true
traveller: you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages
than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry.
You are not worth another word, else I&#8217;ld call you knave. I
leave you.</p>

<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to
the wars!<br>
He wears his honour in a box unseen,<br>
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,<br>
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,<br>
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet<br>
Of Mars&#8217;s fiery steed. To other regions<br>
France is a stable; we that dwell in&#8217;t jades;<br>
Therefore, to the war!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">It shall be so: I&#8217;ll send her to my
house,<br>
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,<br>
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king<br>
That which I durst not speak; his present gift<br>
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,<br>
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife<br>
To the dark house and the detested wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.<br>
I&#8217;ll send her straight away: to-morrow<br>
I&#8217;ll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Why, these balls bound; there&#8217;s noise in
it. &#8217;Tis hard:<br>
A young man married is a man that&#8217;s marr&#8217;d:<br>
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:<br>
The king has done you wrong: but, hush, &#8217;tis so.</p>

<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>

<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a
man&#8217;s tongue shakes out his master&#8217;s undoing: to say
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have nothing, is to
be a great part of your title; which is within a very little of
nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Away! thou&#8217;rt a knave.</p>

<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">By what observance, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend
the ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his teeth and sing.
I know a man that had this trick of melancholy sold a goodly manor
for a song.</p>

come.</p>

<p class="speech">I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
old ling and our Isbels o&#8217; the country are nothing like your
old ling and your Isbels o&#8217; the court: the brains of my
Cupid&#8217;s knocked out, and I begin to love, as an old man loves
money, with no stomach.</p>

you a daughter-in-law: she hath recovered the king, and undone me.
I have wedded her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the

before the report come. If there be breadth enough in the world, I
will hold a long distance. My duty to you. Your unfortunate son,
Bertram.</p>
<p class="speech">This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.<br>
To fly the favours of so good a king;<br>

<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I thought he
would.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">Why should he be killed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he
does: the danger is in standing to&#8217;t; that&#8217;s the loss
of men, though it be the getting of children. Here they come will
tell you more: for my part, I only hear your son was run away.</p>

Thither we bend again.</p>

<p class="speech">I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;<br>
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,<br>
Thou robb&#8217;st me of a moiety: he was my son;<br>
But I do wash his name out of my blood,<br>
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?</p>

Write, write, that from the bloody course of war<br>
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:<br>
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far<br>
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:<br>
His taken labours bid him me forgive;<br>

That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.<br>
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.<br>
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:<br>
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,<br>
He will return; and hope I may that she,<br>
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,<br>
Led hither by pure love: which of them both<br>
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense<br>
To make distinction: provide this messenger:<br>
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;<br>

filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl.
Beware of them, Diana; their promises, enticements, oaths, tokens,
and all these engines of lust, are not the things they go under:
many a maid hath been seduced by them; and the misery is, example,
that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood, cannot for all
that dissuade succession, but that they are limed with the twigs
that threaten them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but I

lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise
of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to

you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never

<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be
recovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">It might have been recovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">It might; but it is not now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, I
would have that drum or another, or &#8217;hic jacet.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if you have a stomach, to&#8217;t, monsieur:
if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of
honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the
enterprise and go on; I will grace the attempt for a worthy
exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the
utmost syllable of your worthiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">But you must not now slumber in it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll about it this evening: and I will
presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty,
put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear
further from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone
about it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
the attempt I vow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I know thou&#8217;rt valiant; and, to the
possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee.
Farewell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake
this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to
do and dares better be damned than to do&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain
it is that he will steal himself into a man&#8217;s favour and for
a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him
out, you have him ever after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">None in the world; but return with an invention
and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost
embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not
for your lordship&#8217;s respect.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll make you some sport with the fox ere
we case him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu: when his
disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him;
which you shall see this very night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.</p>

<p class="speech">But you say she&#8217;s honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s all the fault: I spoke with her but
once<br>
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,<br>
By this same coxcomb that we have i&#8217; the wind,<br>
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;<br>
And this is all I have done. She&#8217;s a fair creature:<br>

In any staining act.</p>

<p class="speech">Nor would I wish you.<br>
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,<br>
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken<br>
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,<br>
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,<br>
Err in bestowing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Widow</p>
<p class="speech">I should believe you:<br>
For you have show&#8217;d me that which well approves<br>
You&#8217;re great in fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Take this purse of gold,<br>
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,<br>
Which I will over-pay and pay again<br>
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,<br>
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,<br>
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,<br>
As we&#8217;ll direct her how &#8217;tis best to bear it.<br>
Now his important blood will nought deny<br>
That she&#8217;ll demand: a ring the county wears,<br>
That downward hath succeeded in his house<br>
From son to son, some four or five descents<br>
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds<br>
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,<br>
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,<br>
Howe&#8217;er repented after.</p>

The bottom of your purpose.</p>

But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,<br>
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;<br>
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,<br>
Herself most chastely absent: after this,<br>
To marry her, I&#8217;ll add three thousand crowns<br>
To what is passed already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Widow</p>
<p class="speech">I have yielded:<br>
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,<br>
That time and place with this deceit so lawful<br>
May prove coherent. Every night he comes<br>
With musics of all sorts and songs composed<br>
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us<br>
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists<br>
As if his life lay on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Why then to-night<br>
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,<br>
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed<br>

own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to
know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs&#8217; language,
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you, interpreter, you must

say I got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
will say, &#8216;Came you off with so little?&#8217; and great ones
I dare not give. Wherefore, what&#8217;s the instance? Tongue, I

And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,<br>
In your fine frame hath love no quality?<br>
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,<br>
You are no maiden, but a monument:<br>
When you are dead, you should be such a one<br>
As you are now, for you are cold and stem;<br>
And now you should be as your mother was<br>
When your sweet self was got.</p>

If I should swear by God&#8217;s great attributes,<br>
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,<br>
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,<br>
To swear by him whom I protest to love,<br>
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths<br>
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal&#8217;d,<br>
At least in my opinion.</p>

course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till
they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action
contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream
o&#8217;erflows himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>

of our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his company

house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques le Grand; which
holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished;
and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey
to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she
sings in heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">How is this justified?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death
itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was
faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place.</p>

this.</p>

for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>

<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he
hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for
France. The duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the
king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">They shall be no more than needful there, if they
were more than they can commend.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>

midnight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
month&#8217;s length a-piece, by an abstract of success: I have
congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a
wife, mourned for her; writ to my lady mother I am returning;
entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch
effected many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but that I
have not ended yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">If the business be of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your
lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this dialogue between the
fool and the soldier? Come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he
has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Bring him forth: has sat i&#8217; the stocks all
night, poor gallant knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">No matter: his heels have deserved it, in
usurping his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I have told your lordship already, the stocks
carry him. But to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps
like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to
Morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his
remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i&#8217;
the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing of me, has a&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">His confession is taken, and it shall be read to
his face: if your lordship be in&#8217;t, as I believe you are, you
must have the patience to hear it.</p>

<p class="speech">Well, that&#8217;s set down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly thank you, sir: a truth&#8217;s a truth,

<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>

hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a hundred and fifty;
Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian,
Cosmo, Lodowick, and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so
that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not
to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake snow
from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">What shall be done to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him

Captain Dumain be i&#8217; the camp, a Frenchman; what his
reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with
well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.&#8217; What

<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of

<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Do you know this Captain Dumain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I know him: a&#8217; was a botcher&#8217;s
&#8217;prentice in Paris, from whence he was whipped for getting
the shrieve&#8217;s fool with child,&#8212;a dumb innocent, that
could not say him nay.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>

an advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one Diana, to take
heed of the allurement of one Count Rousillon, a foolish idle boy,
but for all that very ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll read it first, by your
favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">My meaning in&#8217;t, I protest, was very honest
in the behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be a
dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and
devours up all the fry it finds.</p>

<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll see what may be done, so you confess
freely; therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you have
answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is
his honesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he professes not keeping
of oaths; in breaking &#8217;em he is stronger than Hercules: he
will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth
were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be
swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his
bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in
straw. I have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man
should have, he has nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I begin to love him for this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
him for me, he&#8217;s more and more a cat.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">What say you to his expertness in war?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the
English tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of his
soldiership I know not; except, in that country he had the honour
to be the officer at a place there called Mile-end, to instruct for
the doubling of files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
this I am not certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
rarity redeems him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">A pox on him, he&#8217;s a cat still.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">His qualities being at this poor price, I need
not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, for a quart d&#8217;ecu he will sell the
fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it
perpetually.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s his brother, the other Captain
Dumain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Why does be ask him of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en a crow o&#8217; the same nest; not
altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother
is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any
lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp.</p>

<p class="speech">A shrewd knave and an unhappy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">So he is. My lord that&#8217;s gone made himself
much sport out of him: by his authority he remains here, which he
thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and, indeed, he has no pace,
but runs where he will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">I like him well; &#8217;tis not amiss. And I was
about to tell you, since I heard of the good lady&#8217;s death and
that my lord your son was upon his return home, I moved the king my
master to speak in the behalf of my daughter; which, in the
minority of them both, his majesty, out of a self-gracious
remembrance, did first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath conceived against your
son, there is no fitter matter. How does your ladyship like it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
happily effected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as
able body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here to-morrow, or
I am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom
failed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die. I have letters that my son will be here to-night: I shall
beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet
together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
safely be admitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Countess</p>
<p class="speech">You need but plead your honourable privilege.</p>

<p class="speech">O madam, yonder&#8217;s my lord your son with a
patch of velvet on&#8217;s face: whether there be a scar
under&#8217;t or no, the velvet knows; but &#8217;tis a goodly
patch of velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a half,
but his right cheek is worn bare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good
livery of honour; so belike is that.</p>

says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the carp as you may;

Offence of mighty note; but to himself<br>

Which warp&#8217;d the line of every other favour;<br>
Scorn&#8217;d a fair colour, or express&#8217;d it stolen;<br>
Extended or contracted all proportions<br>

The dust that did offend it.</p>

Necessitied to help, that by this token<br>

I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed<br>
To mine own fortune and inform&#8217;d her fully<br>
I could not answer in that course of honour<br>
As she had made the overture, she ceased<br>
In heavy satisfaction and would never<br>
Receive the ring again.</p>

That you are well acquainted with yourself,<br>
Confess &#8217;twas hers, and by what rough enforcement<br>
You got it from her: she call&#8217;d the saints to surety<br>
That she would never put it from her finger,<br>

<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Find him, and bring him hither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">What of him?<br>
He&#8217;s quoted for a most perfidious slave,<br>
With all the spots o&#8217; the world tax&#8217;d and
debosh&#8217;d;<br>
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.<br>
Am I or that or this for what he&#8217;ll utter,<br>
That will speak any thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">She hath that ring of yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I think she has: certain it is I liked her,<br>
And boarded her i&#8217; the wanton way of youth:<br>
She knew her distance and did angle for me,<br>
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,<br>
As all impediments in fancy&#8217;s course<br>
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,<br>
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,<br>
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;<br>
And I had that which any inferior might<br>
At market-price have bought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">I must be patient:<br>
You, that have turn&#8217;d off a first so noble wife,<br>
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;<br>
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;<br>
Send for your ring, I will return it home,<br>
And give me mine again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">I have it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">What ring was yours, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, much like<br>
The same upon your finger.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Know you this ring? this ring was his of
late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">And this was it I gave him, being abed.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">The story then goes false, you threw it him<br>
Out of a casement.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I have spoke the truth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Parolles</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.<br>
Is this the man you speak of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge
you,<br>
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,<br>
Which on your just proceeding I&#8217;ll keep off,<br>
By him and by this woman here what know you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">So please your majesty, my master hath been an
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen
have.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this
woman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">How, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a
woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">How is that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">He loved her, sir, and loved her not.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
equivocal companion is this!</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">I am a poor man, and at your majesty&#8217;s
command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a good drum, my lord, but a naughty
orator.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Do you know he promised me marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I know more than I&#8217;ll speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Parolles</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between
them, as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for indeed he
was mad for her, and talked of Satan and of Limbo and of Furies and
I know not what: yet I was in that credit with them at that time
that I knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as
promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will
to speak of; therefore I will not speak what I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst
say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence;
therefore stand aside.<br>
This ring, you say, was yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Who lent it you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It was not lent me neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you find it, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">I found it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">If it were yours by none of all these ways,<br>
How could you give it him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">I never gave it him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">This woman&#8217;s an easy glove, my lord; she
goes off and on at pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Take her away; I do not like her now;<br>
To prison with her: and away with him.<br>
Unless thou tell&#8217;st me where thou hadst this ring,<br>
Thou diest within this hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll never tell you.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Take her away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I&#8217;ll put in bail, my
liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">I think thee now some common customer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">By Jove, if ever I knew man, &#8217;twas you.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore hast thou accused him all this
while?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Because he&#8217;s guilty, and he is not
guilty:<br>
He knows I am no maid, and he&#8217;ll swear to&#8217;t;<br>
I&#8217;ll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.<br>
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;<br>
I am either maid, or else this old man&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Widow</span></p>
<p class="speech">The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,<br>
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,<br>
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,<br>
Though yet he never harm&#8217;d me, here I quit him:<br>
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;<br>
And at that time he got his wife with child:<br>
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:<br>
So there&#8217;s my riddle: one that&#8217;s dead is quick:<br>
And now behold the meaning.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Widow, with
Helena</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Is there no exorcist<br>
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?<br>
Is&#8217;t real that I see?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord;<br>
&#8217;Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,<br>
The name and not the thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">Both, both. O, pardon!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O my good lord, when I was like this maid,<br>
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;<br>
And, look you, here&#8217;s your letter; this it says:<br>
&#8216;When from my finger you can get this ring<br>
And are by me with child,&#8217; &amp; c. This is done:<br>
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bertram</p>
<p class="speech">If she, my liege, can make me know this
clearly,<br>
I&#8217;ll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">If it appear not plain and prove untrue,<br>
Deadly divorce step between me and you!<br>
O my dear mother, do I see you living?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lafeu</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Parolles</span></p>
<p class="speech">Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,<br>
I thank thee: wait on me home, I&#8217;ll make sport with thee:<br>
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">King</p>
<p class="speech">Let us from point to point this story know,<br>
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Diana</span></p>
<p class="speech">If thou be&#8217;st yet a fresh uncropped
flower,<br>
Choose thou thy husband, and I&#8217;ll pay thy dower;<br>
For I can guess that by thy honest aid<br>
Thou keep&#8217;st a wife herself, thyself a maid.<br>
Of that and all the progress, more or less,<br>
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:<br>
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,<br>
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.</p>
