<h3>Introduction <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p>Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's later plays, appearing about 1607.

<p>This tragedy revolves around Caius Martius Coriolanus, a brilliant Roman
general who ultimately is banished from Rome and leads an assault on
that same city. Only the pleadings of his mother stop him from sacking
Rome, a change of heart which leads to his destruction.

<p>Coriolanus is a legendary figure who is said to
have lived during the 5th century BC. Born Gaius Marcius, he was given
the surname as a result of his action in capturing the Volscian town of
Corioli in 439 BC.

<p>According to Plutarch<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
Coriolanus represented the Roman aristocracy and
was well respected in the Roman Senate for arguing against the
democratic inclinations of the plebians. He was perpetually banished
from Rome upon being convicted on charges of misapropriation of public
funds. He later turned against Rome and made allegiance with the same
Volscians he had once fought against. Plutarch's account of his
defection tells that Coriolanus donned a disguise and snuck into the
home of a wealthy Volcian noble, a certain Tullus Aufidius, and appealed
to him as a suppliant. Coriolanus and Aufidius then persuaded the
Volscians to break their truce with Rome and raise an army to invade.
When Coriolanus' Volscian troops threatened the city, Roman matrons,
including his wife and mother, were sent to persuade him to call off the
attack. At the sight of his mother, wife and children throwing
themselves at his feet in supplication, Coriolanus relented, withdrew
his troops from the border of Rome, and retired to Aufidius' home city
of Antium. Aufidius then raised support to have Coriolanus put on trial
by the Volcians, and then formed a conspiracy to assassinate him before
the trial had ended.

<p>The tale of Coriolanus' appeal to Aufidius is quite similar to a tale
from the life of Themistocles, a leader of the Athenian_democracy who
was a contemporary of Coriolanus (given the important dictinction that
Themistocles was an actual historical figure and Coriolanus was not).
During Themistocles' exile from Athens, he travelled to the home of
Admetus, King of the Molossians, a man who was his personal enemy.
Themistocles came to Admetus in disguise and appealed to him as a
fugitive, just as Coriolanus appealed to Aufidius. Themistocles,
however, never attempted military retailiation against Athens.
