<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p class="speech">Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross&#8217;d lovers take their life;<br>
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents&#8217; strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark&#8217;d love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents&#8217; rage,<br>
Which, but their children&#8217;s end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours&#8217; traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<h4>Scene I. Verona. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sampson and Gregory, of
the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Gregory, o&#8217; my word, we&#8217;ll not carry
coals.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, an we be in choler, we&#8217;ll draw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o&#8217;
the collar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to
stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn&#8217;st away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I
will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest
goes
to the wall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">True; and therefore women, being the weaker
vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague&#8217;s men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">The quarrel is between our masters and us their
men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:
when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">The heads of the maids?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the heads of the maids, or their
maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
and<br>
&#8217;tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,
thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">How! turn thy back and run?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Fear me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No, marry; I fear thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Let us take the law of our sides; let them
begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
as
they list.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Abraham and
Balthasar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gregory]</span> Is
the law of our side, if I say
ay?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but
I
bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Quarrel sir! no, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a
man as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">No better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Say &#8216;better:&#8217; here comes one of my
master&#8217;s kinsmen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, better, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">You lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy
swashing blow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Part, fools!<br>
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats down their
swords</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tybalt</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou drawn among these heartless
hinds?<br>
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br>
Or manage it to part these men with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the
word,<br>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<br>
Have at thee, coward!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, several of both
houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with
clubs</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them
down!<br>
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Capulet in his gown,
and Lady Capulet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">What noise is this? Give me my long sword,
ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<br>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Montague and Lady
Montague</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Thou villain Capulet,&#8212;Hold me not, let me
go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince, with
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,&#8212;<br>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistemper&#8217;d weapons to the ground,<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
Have thrice disturb&#8217;d the quiet of our streets,<br>
And made Verona&#8217;s ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
Canker&#8217;d with peace, to part your canker&#8217;d hate:<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time, all the rest depart away:<br>
You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>
To know our further pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Montague, Lady
Montague, and Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<br>
I drew to part them: in the instant came<br>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<br>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>
He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss&#8217;d him in scorn:<br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br>
Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>
Till the prince came, who parted either part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Montague</p>
<p class="speech">O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?<br>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#8217;d
sun<br>
Peer&#8217;d forth the golden window of the east,<br>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br>
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br>
That westward rooteth from the city&#8217;s side,<br>
So early walking did I see your son:<br>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me<br>
And stole into the covert of the wood:<br>
I, measuring his affections by my own,<br>
That most are busied when they&#8217;re most alone,<br>
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,<br>
And gladly shunn&#8217;d who gladly fled from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.<br>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>
Should in the furthest east begin to draw<br>
The shady curtains from Aurora&#8217;s bed,<br>
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,<br>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out<br>
And makes himself an artificial night:<br>
Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">I neither know it nor can learn of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Have you importuned him by any means?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Both by myself and many other friends:<br>
But he, his own affections&#8217; counsellor,<br>
Is to himself&#8212;I will not say how true&#8212;<br>
But to himself so secret and so close,<br>
So far from sounding and discovery,<br>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,<br>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<br>
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.<br>
We would as willingly give cure as know.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">See, where he comes: so please you, step
aside;<br>
I&#8217;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,<br>
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#8217;s away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Montague and Lady
Montague</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Good-morrow, cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is the day so young?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">But new struck nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! sad hours seem long.<br>
Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#8217;s
hours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Not having that, which, having, makes them
short.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">In love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Out&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Of love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Out of her favour, where I am in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,<br>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,<br>
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!<br>
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br>
Here&#8217;s much to do with hate, but more with love.<br>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br>
O any thing, of nothing first create!<br>
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br>
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!<br>
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!<br>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br>
Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">No, coz, I rather weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good heart, at what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">At thy good heart&#8217;s oppression.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Why, such is love&#8217;s transgression.<br>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br>
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown<br>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;<br>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers&#8217; eyes;<br>
Being vex&#8217;d a sea nourish&#8217;d with lovers&#8217;
tears:<br>
What is it else? a madness most discreet,<br>
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.<br>
Farewell, my coz.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Soft! I will go along;<br>
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;<br>
This is not Romeo, he&#8217;s some other where.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Groan! why, no.<br>
But sadly tell me who.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:<br>
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!<br>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I aim&#8217;d so near, when I supposed you
loved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A right good mark-man! And she&#8217;s fair I
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, in that hit you miss: she&#8217;ll not be
hit<br>
With Cupid&#8217;s arrow; she hath Dian&#8217;s wit;<br>
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm&#8217;d,<br>
From love&#8217;s weak childish bow she lives unharm&#8217;d.<br>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br>
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,<br>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<br>
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,<br>
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Then she hath sworn that she will still live
chaste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">She hath, and in that sparing makes huge
waste,<br>
For beauty starved with her severity<br>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br>
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br>
To merit bliss by making me despair:<br>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br>
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, teach me how I should forget to think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">By giving liberty unto thine eyes;<br>
Examine other beauties.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the way<br>
To call hers exquisite, in question more:<br>
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#8217; brows<br>
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;<br>
He that is strucken blind cannot forget<br>
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:<br>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br>
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note<br>
Where I may read who pass&#8217;d that passing fair?<br>
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll pay that doctrine, or else die in
debt.</p>

Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">But Montague is bound as well as I,<br>
In penalty alike; and &#8217;tis not hard, I think,<br>
For men so old as we to keep the peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Of honourable reckoning are you both;<br>
And pity &#8217;tis you lived at odds so long.<br>
But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">But saying o&#8217;er what I have said
before:<br>
My child is yet a stranger in the world;<br>
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,<br>
Let two more summers wither in their pride,<br>
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Younger than she are happy mothers made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">And too soon marr&#8217;d are those so early
made.<br>
The earth hath swallow&#8217;d all my hopes but she,<br>
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:<br>
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,<br>
My will to her consent is but a part;<br>
An she agree, within her scope of choice<br>
Lies my consent and fair according voice.<br>
This night I hold an old accustom&#8217;d feast,<br>
Whereto I have invited many a guest,<br>
Such as I love; and you, among the store,<br>
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.<br>
At my poor house look to behold this night<br>
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:<br>
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel<br>
When well-apparell&#8217;d April on the heel<br>
Of limping winter treads, even such delight<br>
Among fresh female buds shall you this night<br>
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,<br>
And like her most whose merit most shall be:<br>
Which on more view, of many mine being one<br>
May stand in number, though in reckoning none,<br>
Come, go with me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Servant, giving a
paper</span></p>

is
written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
sent to find those persons whose names are here
writ, and can never find what names the writing
person hath here writ. I must to the learned.&#8212;In good
time.</p>

burning,<br>

Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;<br>
One desperate grief cures with another&#8217;s languish:<br>
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,<br>
And the rank poison of the old will die.</p>

<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;<br>
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,<br>
Whipp&#8217;d and tormented and&#8212;God-den, good fellow.</p>

We must talk in secret:&#8212;nurse, come back again;<br>
I have remember&#8217;d me, thou&#8217;s hear our counsel.<br>

Susan and she&#8212;God rest all Christian souls!&#8212;<br>
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;<br>
She was too good for me: but, as I said,<br>
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;<br>
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.<br>
&#8217;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<br>
And she was wean&#8217;d,&#8212;I never shall forget it,&#8212;<br>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:<br>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br>
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;<br>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:&#8212;<br>
Nay, I do bear a brain:&#8212;but, as I said,<br>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!<br>
Shake quoth the dove-house: &#8217;twas no need, I trow,<br>
To bid me trudge:<br>
And since that time it is eleven years;<br>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,<br>
She could have run and waddled all about;<br>
For even the day before, she broke her brow:<br>
And then my husband&#8212;God be with his soul!<br>
A&#8217; was a merry man&#8212;took up the child:<br>
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;dost thou fall upon thy
face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; and, by my holidame,<br>
The pretty wretch left crying and said &#8216;Ay.&#8217;<br>
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!<br>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,<br>
I never should forget it: &#8216;Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; quoth
he;<br>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said &#8216;Ay.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,<br>
To think it should leave crying and say &#8216;Ay.&#8217;<br>
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow<br>
A bump as big as a young cockerel&#8217;s stone;<br>
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:<br>
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; quoth my husband,&#8217;fall&#8217;st upon thy
face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; it stinted and said

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e&#8217;er I nursed:<br>
An I might live to see thee married once,<br>
I have my wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that &#8216;marry&#8217; is the very

I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,<br>
How stands your disposition to be married?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">It is an honour that I dream not of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">An honour! were not I thine only nurse,<br>
I would say thou hadst suck&#8217;d wisdom from thy teat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, think of marriage now; younger than
you,<br>
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br>
Are made already mothers: by my count,<br>
I was your mother much upon these years<br>
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:<br>
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">A man, young lady! lady, such a man<br>
As all the world&#8212;why, he&#8217;s a man of wax.</p>

This night you shall behold him at our feast;<br>
Read o&#8217;er the volume of young Paris&#8217; face,<br>
And find delight writ there with beauty&#8217;s pen;<br>
Examine every married lineament,<br>
And see how one another lends content<br>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies<br>
Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:<br>
The fish lives in the sea, and &#8217;tis much pride<br>
For fair without the fair within to hide:<br>
That book in many&#8217;s eyes doth share the glory,<br>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br>
So shall you share all that he doth possess,<br>
By having him, making yourself no less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</p>

Benvolio, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall this speech be spoke for our
excuse?<br>
Or shall we on without a apology?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">The date is out of such prolixity:<br>
We&#8217;ll have no Cupid hoodwink&#8217;d with a scarf,<br>
Bearing a Tartar&#8217;s painted bow of lath,<br>
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;<br>
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke<br>
After the prompter, for our entrance:<br>
But let them measure us by what they will;<br>
We&#8217;ll measure them a measure, and be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;<br>
Being but heavy, I will bear the light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes<br>
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead<br>
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">You are a lover; borrow Cupid&#8217;s wings,<br>
And soar with them above a common bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I am too sore enpierced with his shaft<br>
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,<br>
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:<br>
Under love&#8217;s heavy burden do I sink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">And, to sink in it, should you burden love;<br>
Too great oppression for a tender thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,<br>
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">If love be rough with you, be rough with
love;<br>
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.<br>
Give me a case to put my visage in:<br>
A visor for a visor! what care I<br>
What curious eye doth quote deformities?<br>
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,<br>
But every man betake him to his legs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A torch for me: let wantons light of heart<br>
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,<br>
For I am proverb&#8217;d with a grandsire phrase;<br>
I&#8217;ll be a candle-holder, and look on.<br>
The game was ne&#8217;er so fair, and I am done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, dun&#8217;s the mouse, the constable&#8217;s
own word:<br>
If thou art dun, we&#8217;ll draw thee from the mire<br>
Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick&#8217;st<br>
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, sir, in delay<br>
We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.<br>
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits<br>
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And we mean well in going to this mask;<br>
But &#8217;tis no wit to go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, may one ask?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I dream&#8217;d a dream to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">And so did I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what was yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">That dreamers often lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">In bed asleep, while they do dream things
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>
She is the fairies&#8217; midwife, and she comes<br>
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<br>
On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br>
Drawn with a team of little atomies<br>
Athwart men&#8217;s noses as they lie asleep;<br>
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders&#8217; legs,<br>
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br>
The traces of the smallest spider&#8217;s web,<br>
The collars of the moonshine&#8217;s watery beams,<br>
Her whip of cricket&#8217;s bone, the lash of film,<br>
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,<br>
Not so big as a round little worm<br>
Prick&#8217;d from the lazy finger of a maid;<br>
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut<br>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>
Time out o&#8217; mind the fairies&#8217; coachmakers.<br>
And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
Through lovers&#8217; brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
O&#8217;er courtiers&#8217; knees, that dream on court&#8217;sies
straight,<br>
O&#8217;er lawyers&#8217; fingers, who straight dream on fees,<br>
O&#8217;er ladies&#8217; lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<br>
Sometime she gallops o&#8217;er a courtier&#8217;s nose,<br>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#8217;s tail<br>
Tickling a parson&#8217;s nose as a&#8217; lies asleep,<br>
Then dreams, he of another benefice:<br>
Sometime she driveth o&#8217;er a soldier&#8217;s neck,<br>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon<br>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br>
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<br>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
That plats the manes of horses in the night,<br>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<br>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>
Making them women of good carriage:<br>
This is she&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!<br>
Thou talk&#8217;st of nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">True, I talk of dreams,<br>
Which are the children of an idle brain,<br>
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<br>
Which is as thin of substance as the air<br>
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes<br>
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,<br>
And, being anger&#8217;d, puffs away from thence,<br>
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">This wind, you talk of, blows us from
ourselves;<br>
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I fear, too early: for my mind misgives<br>
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars<br>
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br>
With this night&#8217;s revels and expire the term<br>
Of a despised life closed in my breast<br>
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br>
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,<br>
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.</p>

You will set cock-a-hoop! you&#8217;ll be the man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Why, uncle, &#8217;tis a shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, go to;<br>
You are a saucy boy: is&#8217;t so, indeed?<br>
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:<br>
You must contrary me! marry, &#8217;tis time.<br>
Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:<br>
Be quiet, or&#8212;More light, more light! For shame!<br>
I&#8217;ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting<br>
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.<br>
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall<br>
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Juliet]</span> If I
profane with my unworthiest hand<br>
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:<br>
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand<br>
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too
much,<br>
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;<br>
For saints have hands that pilgrims&#8217; hands do touch,<br>
And palm to palm is holy palmers&#8217; kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in
prayer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands
do;<br>
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Saints do not move, though grant for
prayers&#8217; sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Then move not, while my prayer&#8217;s effect I
take.<br>
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Then have my lips the sin that they have
took.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!<br>
Give me my sin again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">You kiss by the book.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, your mother craves a word with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What is her mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, bachelor,<br>
Her mother is the lady of the house,<br>
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous<br>
I nursed her daughter, that you talk&#8217;d withal;<br>
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her<br>
Shall have the chinks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is she a Capulet?<br>
O dear account! my life is my foe&#8217;s debt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Away, begone; the sport is at the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;<br>
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.<br>
Is it e&#8217;en so? why, then, I thank you all<br>
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.<br>
More torches here! Come on then, let&#8217;s to bed.<br>
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:<br>
I&#8217;ll to my rest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Juliet and
Nurse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">The son and heir of old Tiberio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he that now is going out of
door?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he that follows there, that would
not dance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Go ask his name: if he be married.<br>
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">His name is Romeo, and a Montague;<br>
The only son of your great enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">My only love sprung from my only hate!<br>
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!<br>
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,<br>
That I must love a loathed enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s this? what&#8217;s this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">A rhyme I learn&#8217;d even now<br>
Of one I danced withal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">One calls within
&#8216;Juliet.&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Anon, anon!<br>
Come, let&#8217;s away; the strangers all are gone.</p>
