<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Francisco at his post. Enter
to him Bernardo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Long live the king!</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Bernardo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">He.</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,
Francisco.</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">For this relief much thanks: &#8217;tis bitter
cold,<br>
And I am sick at heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Have you had quiet guard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Not a mouse stirring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, good night.<br>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who&#8217;s
there?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Horatio and
Marcellus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Friends to this ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">And liegemen to the Dane.</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Give you good night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">O, farewell, honest soldier:<br>
Who hath relieved you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Bernardo has my place.<br>
Give you good night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Holla! Bernardo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Say,<br>
What, is Horatio there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">What, has this thing appear&#8217;d again
to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">I have seen nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Horatio says &#8217;tis but our fantasy,<br>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br>
With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>
That if again this apparition come,<br>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, tush, &#8217;twill not appear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Sit down awhile;<br>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br>
That are so fortified against our story<br>
What we have two nights seen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sit we down,<br>
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Last night of all,<br>
When yond same star that&#8217;s westward from the pole<br>
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>
The bell then beating one,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes
again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">In the same figure, like the king that&#8217;s
dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Most like: it harrows me with fear and
wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">It would be spoke to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Question it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What art thou that usurp&#8217;st this time of
night,<br>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">It is offended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;See, it stalks away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>
What think you on&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Before my God, I might not this believe<br>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br>
Of mine own eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Is it not like the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">As thou art to thyself:<br>
Such was the very armour he had on<br>
When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br>
So frown&#8217;d he once, when, in an angry parle,<br>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>
&#8217;Tis strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead
hour,<br>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">In what particular thought to work I know
not;<br>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that
knows,<br>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>
Who is&#8217;t that can inform me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">That can I;<br>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>
Whose image even but now appear&#8217;d to us,<br>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>
Thereto prick&#8217;d on by a most emulate pride,<br>
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet&#8212;<br>
For so this side of our known world esteem&#8217;d him&#8212;<br>
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&#8217;d compact,<br>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br>
Was gaged by our king; which had return&#8217;d<br>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br>
And carriage of the article design&#8217;d,<br>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>
Shark&#8217;d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>
That hath a stomach in&#8217;t; which is no other&#8212;<br>
As it doth well appear unto our state&#8212;<br>
But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>
The source of this our watch and the chief head<br>
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">I think it be no other but e&#8217;en so:<br>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>
That was and is the question of these wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A mote it is to trouble the mind&#8217;s eye.<br>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br>
Upon whose influence Neptune&#8217;s empire stands<br>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.&#8212;<br>
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay,
illusion!<br>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br>
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>
Speak to me:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cock crows</span></p>
<p class="speech">If thou art privy to thy country&#8217;s
fate,<br>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Do, if it will not stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis gone!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speech">We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>
To offer it the show of violence;<br>
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">And then it started like a guilty thing<br>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>
The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>
To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>
This present object made probation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>
Some say that ever &#8217;gainst that season comes<br>
Wherein our Saviour&#8217;s birth is celebrated,<br>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br>
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br>
So hallow&#8217;d and so gracious is the time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>
Walks o&#8217;er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br>
Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s do&#8217;t, I pray; and I this
morning know<br>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A room of state in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Claudius, Queen
Gertrude, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords,
and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&#8217;s
death<br>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
Have we, as &#8217;twere with a defeated joy,&#8212;<br>
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,&#8212;<br>
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr&#8217;d<br>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>
Or thinking by our late dear brother&#8217;s death<br>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br>
He hath not fail&#8217;d to pester us with message,<br>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,&#8212;<br>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew&#8217;s purpose,&#8212;to suppress<br>
His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br>
The lists and full proportions, are all made<br>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the king, more than the scope<br>
Of these delated articles allow.<br>
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speaker">Voltimand</p>
<p class="speech">In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Voltimand and
Cornelius</span></p>
<p class="speech">And now, Laertes, what&#8217;s the news with
you?<br>
You told us of some suit; what is&#8217;t, Laertes?<br>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br>
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">My dread lord,<br>
Your leave and favour to return to France;<br>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br>
To show my duty in your coronation,<br>
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Have you your father&#8217;s leave? What says
Polonius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br>
By laboursome petition, and at last<br>
Upon his will I seal&#8217;d my hard consent:<br>
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> A little more
than kin, and less than kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; I am too much i&#8217; the
sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br>
Thou know&#8217;st &#8217;tis common; all that lives must die,<br>
Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, it is common.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">If it be,<br>
Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not
&#8217;seems.&#8217;<br>
&#8217;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>
Nor the dejected &#8217;havior of the visage,<br>
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br>
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br>
For they are actions that a man might play:<br>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,
Hamlet,<br>
To give these mourning duties to your father:<br>
But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>
In filial obligation for some term<br>
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br>
Of impious stubbornness; &#8217;tis unmanly grief;<br>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>
An understanding simple and unschool&#8217;d:<br>
For what we know must be and is as common<br>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>
Take it to heart? Fie! &#8217;tis a fault to heaven,<br>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>
To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>
&#8216;This must be so.&#8217; We pray you, throw to earth<br>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br>
As of a father: for let the world take note,<br>
You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>
And with no less nobility of love<br>
Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis a loving and a fair reply:<br>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br>
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br>
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>
And the king&#8217;s rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br>
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Hamlet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix&#8217;d<br>
His canon &#8217;gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>
Fie on&#8217;t! ah fie! &#8217;tis an unweeded garden,<br>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br>
So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br>
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month&#8212;<br>
Let me not think on&#8217;t&#8212;Frailty, thy name is
woman!&#8212;<br>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>
With which she follow&#8217;d my poor father&#8217;s body,<br>
Like Niobe, all tears:&#8212;why she, even she&#8212;<br>
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br>
Would have mourn&#8217;d longer&#8212;married with my uncle,<br>
My father&#8217;s brother, but no more like my father<br>
Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>
It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br>
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Horatio, Marcellus, and

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I would not hear your enemy say so,<br>
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br>
To make it truster of your own report<br>
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.<br>
But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br>
We&#8217;ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I came to see your father&#8217;s
funeral.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br>
I think it was to see my mother&#8217;s wedding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, it follow&#8217;d hard upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked
meats<br>
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br>
My father!&#8212;methinks I see my father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Where, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In my mind&#8217;s eye,
Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>
I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Saw? who?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the king your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The king my father!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Season your admiration for awhile<br>
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br>
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br>
This marvel to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">For God&#8217;s love, let me hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br>
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br>
In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br>
Been thus encounter&#8217;d. A figure like your father,<br>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&#8217;d<br>
By their oppress&#8217;d and fear-surprised eyes,<br>
Within his truncheon&#8217;s length; whilst they, distilled<br>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>
Where, as they had deliver&#8217;d, both in time,<br>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>
The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br>
These hands are not more like.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">But where was this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, upon the platform where we
watch&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Did you not speak to it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I did;<br>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br>
It lifted up its head and did address<br>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br>
And vanish&#8217;d from our sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">As I do live, my honour&#8217;d lord, &#8217;tis
true;<br>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>
To let you know of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br>
Hold you the watch to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">We do, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>

<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What, look&#8217;d he frowningly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Pale or red?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, very pale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And fix&#8217;d his eyes upon
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Most constantly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I would I had been there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Very like, very like. Stay&#8217;d it long?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">While one with moderate haste might tell a
hundred.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Longer, longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Not when I saw&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;His beard was
grizzled&#8212;no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br>
A sable silver&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will watch to-night;<br>
Perchance &#8217;twill walk again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant it will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">If it assume my noble father&#8217;s person,<br>
I&#8217;ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br>
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br>
If you have hitherto conceal&#8217;d this sight,<br>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br>
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br>
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br>
Upon the platform, &#8217;twixt eleven and twelve,<br>
I&#8217;ll visit you.</p>

<p class="speech">My necessaries are embark&#8217;d: farewell:<br>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
But let me hear from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">Do you doubt that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No more but so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Think it no more;<br>
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
His greatness weigh&#8217;d, his will is not his own;<br>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
As he in his particular act and place<br>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
To his unmaster&#8217;d importunity.<br>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
Virtue itself &#8217;scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
Whiles, like a puff&#8217;d and reckless libertine,<br>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
And recks not his own rede.</p>

Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
And you are stay&#8217;d for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
Of each new-hatch&#8217;d, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
Bear&#8217;t that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man&#8217;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express&#8217;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>

Hamlet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, well bethought:<br>
&#8217;Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br>
Given private time to you; and you yourself<br>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br>
If it be so, as so &#8217;tis put on me,<br>
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br>
What is between you? give me up the truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>
Of his affection to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</p>

<p class="speech">I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I&#8217;ll teach you: think yourself a
baby;<br>
That you have ta&#8217;en these tenders for true pay,<br>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br>
Or&#8212;not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br>
Running it thus&#8212;you&#8217;ll tender me a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br>
In honourable fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">And hath given countenance to his speech, my
lord,<br>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
Believe so much in him, that he is young<br>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br>
Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
Look to&#8217;t, I charge you: come your ways.</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, marry, is&#8217;t:<br>
But to my mind, though I am native here<br>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>
More honour&#8217;d in the breach than the observance.<br>
This heavy-headed revel east and west<br>
Makes us traduced and tax&#8217;d of other nations:<br>
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br>
From our achievements, though perform&#8217;d at height,<br>

By the o&#8217;ergrowth of some complexion,<br>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br>
Or by some habit that too much o&#8217;er-leavens<br>

Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part<br>
And each particular hair to stand on end,<br>
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O God!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Murder!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Haste me to know&#8217;t, that I, with wings as
swift<br>
As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
May sweep to my revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">I find thee apt;<br>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br>
&#8217;Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br>
Is by a forged process of my death<br>
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br>
The serpent that did sting thy father&#8217;s life<br>
Now wears his crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,&#8212;<br>
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
So to seduce!&#8212;won to his shameful lust<br>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br>
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
To those of mine!<br>
But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link&#8217;d,<br>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br>
And prey on garbage.<br>
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br>
And a most instant tetter bark&#8217;d about,<br>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br>
All my smooth body.<br>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother&#8217;s hand<br>
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch&#8217;d:<br>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
Unhousel&#8217;d, disappointed, unanel&#8217;d,<br>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
With all my imperfections on my head:<br>
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br>
And &#8217;gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br>
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;<br>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
I&#8217;ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
That youth and observation copied there;<br>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
Unmix&#8217;d with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br>
O most pernicious woman!<br>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>
My tables,&#8212;meet it is I set it down,<br>
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;<br>
At least I&#8217;m sure it may be so in Denmark:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Writing</span></p>
<p class="speech">So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;<br>
It is &#8216;Adieu, adieu! remember me.&#8217;<br>
I have sworn &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> My lord, my
lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Lord
Hamlet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Heaven secure
him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">So be it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Hillo, ho,
ho, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Horatio and
Marcellus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">How is&#8217;t, my noble lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What news, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, wonderful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Good my lord, tell it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No; you&#8217;ll reveal it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, my lord, by heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How say you, then; would heart of man once think
it?<br>
But you&#8217;ll be secret?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by heaven, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s ne&#8217;er a villain dwelling in
all Denmark<br>
But he&#8217;s an arrant knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the
grave<br>
To tell us this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, right; you are i&#8217; the
right;<br>
And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:<br>
You, as your business and desire shall point you;<br>
For every man has business and desire,<br>
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,<br>
Look you, I&#8217;ll go pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">These are but wild and whirling words, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;m sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>
Yes, &#8217;faith heartily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no offence, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br>
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:<br>
For your desire to know what is between us,<br>
O&#8217;ermaster &#8217;t as you may. And now, good friends,<br>
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,<br>
Give me one poor request.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t, my lord? we will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Never make known what you have seen to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we will not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but swear&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">In faith,<br>
My lord, not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nor I, my lord, in faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We have sworn, my lord,
already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Beneath]</span> Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, ha, boy! say&#8217;st thou so? art thou
there,
truepenny?<br>
Come on&#8212;you hear this fellow in the cellarage&#8212;<br>
Consent to swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Propose the oath, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Never to speak of this that you have seen,<br>
Swear by my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Beneath]</span> Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Hic et ubique? then we&#8217;ll shift our
ground.<br>
Come hither, gentlemen,<br>
And lay your hands again upon my sword:<br>
Never to speak of this that you have heard,<br>
Swear by my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Beneath]</span> Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, old mole! canst work i&#8217; the
earth so fast?<br>
A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">O day and night, but this is wondrous
strange!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;<br>
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>
How strange or odd soe&#8217;er I bear myself,<br>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>
To put an antic disposition on,<br>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br>
With arms encumber&#8217;d thus, or this headshake,<br>
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>
As &#8216;Well, well, we know,&#8217; or &#8216;We could, an if we
would,&#8217;<br>
Or &#8216;If we list to speak,&#8217; or &#8216;There be, an if
they might,&#8217;<br>
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br>
That you know aught of me: this not to do,<br>
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Beneath]</span> Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They swear</span></p>
<p class="speech">So, gentlemen,<br>
With all my love I do commend me to you:<br>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>
May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,<br>
That ever I was born to set it right!<br>
Nay, come, let&#8217;s go together.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
