5.1)
The language that the Context-free grammar generates is the following:
L = {a^nb^n | n >= 0}
What this is saying is that the language accepts empty strings or strings with the 
same number of a's as b's (where a's come before b's). Example strings include 
{"", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb", .... a^nb^n}

Since this is Context-free grammar, it is Type-2 grammar since the left-hand side 
of each rule is a non-terminal and the right-hand side has terminals and 
non-terminals
