<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">Marina thus the brothel &#8217;scapes, and
chances<br>
Into an honest house, our story says.<br>
She sings like one immortal, and she dances<br>
As goddess-like to her admired lays;<br>
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes<br>
Nature&#8217;s own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,<br>
That even her art sisters the natural roses;<br>
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:<br>
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,<br>
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain<br>
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;<br>
And to her father turn our thoughts again,<br>
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;<br>
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived<br>
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast<br>
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived<br>
God Neptune&#8217;s annual feast to keep: from whence<br>
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,<br>
His banners sable, trimm&#8217;d with rich expense;<br>
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.<br>
In your supposing once more put your sight<br>
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:<br>
Where what is done in action, more, if might,<br>
Shall be discover&#8217;d; please you, sit and hark.</p>

belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them
Helicanus</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To the Sailor of
Mytilene]</span> Where is lord Helicanus?
he can resolve you.<br>
O, here he is.<br>
Sir, there&#8217;s a barge put off from Mytilene,<br>
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,<br>
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.</p>

<p class="speaker">Tyrian Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
This is the man that can, in aught you would,<br>
Resolve you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,<br>
And die as I would do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">You wish me well.<br>
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune&#8217;s triumphs,<br>
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,<br>
I made to it, to know of whence you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">First, what is your place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">I am the governor of this place you lie
before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;<br>
A man who for this three months hath not spoken<br>
To any one, nor taken sustenance<br>
But to prorogue his grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon what ground is his distemperature?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twould be too tedious to repeat;<br>
But the main grief springs from the loss<br>
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">May we not see him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">You may;<br>
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Yet let me obtain my wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Behold him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pericles
discovered</span></p>
<p class="speech">This was a goodly person,<br>
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,<br>
Drove him to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!<br>
Hail, royal sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">It is in vain; he will not speak to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,<br>
Would win some words of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well bethought.<br>
She questionless with her sweet harmony<br>
And other chosen attractions, would allure,<br>
And make a battery through his deafen&#8217;d parts,<br>
Which now are midway stopp&#8217;d:<br>
She is all happy as the fairest of all,<br>
And, with her fellow maids is now upon<br>
The leafy shelter that abuts against<br>
The island&#8217;s side.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Whispers a Lord, who goes off
in the barge of Lysimachus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, all&#8217;s effectless; yet nothing
we&#8217;ll omit<br>
That bears recovery&#8217;s name. But, since your kindness<br>
We have stretch&#8217;d thus far, let us beseech you<br>
That for our gold we may provision have,<br>
Wherein we are not destitute for want,<br>
But weary for the staleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, a courtesy<br>
Which if we should deny, the most just gods<br>
For every graff would send a caterpillar,<br>
And so afflict our province. Yet once more<br>
Let me entreat to know at large the cause<br>
Of your king&#8217;s sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:<br>
But, see, I am prevented.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter, from the barge,
Lord, with Marina, and a young Lady</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">O, here is<br>
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!<br>
Is&#8217;t not a goodly presence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a gallant lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s such a one, that, were I well
assured<br>
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,<br>
I&#8217;ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.<br>
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty<br>
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:<br>
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat<br>
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,<br>
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay<br>
As thy desires can wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will use<br>
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided<br>
That none but I and my companion maid<br>
Be suffer&#8217;d to come near him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let us leave her;<br>
And the gods make her prosperous!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Marina sings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark&#8217;d he your music?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor look&#8217;d on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">See, she will speak to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Hum, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">I am a maid,<br>
My lord, that ne&#8217;er before invited eyes,<br>
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,<br>
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief<br>
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh&#8217;d.<br>
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,<br>
My derivation was from ancestors<br>
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:<br>
But time hath rooted out my parentage,<br>
And to the world and awkward casualties<br>
Bound me in servitude.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I will desist;<br>
But there is something glows upon my cheek,<br>
And whispers in mine ear, &#8216;Go not till he speak.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">My fortunes&#8212;parentage&#8212;good
parentage&#8212;<br>
To equal mine!&#8212;was it not thus? what say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">I said, my lord, if you did know my
parentage,<br>
You would not do me violence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon
me.<br>
You are like something that&#8212;What country-woman?<br>
Here of these shores?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor of any shores:<br>
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am<br>
No other than I appear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I am great with woe, and shall deliver
weeping.<br>
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one<br>
My daughter might have been: my queen&#8217;s square brows;<br>
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;<br>
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like<br>
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;<br>
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,<br>
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Where I am but a stranger: from the deck<br>
You may discern the place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Where were you bred?<br>
And how achieved you these endowments, which<br>
You make more rich to owe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">If I should tell my history, it would seem<br>
Like lies disdain&#8217;d in the reporting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, speak:<br>
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look&#8217;st<br>
Modest as Justice, and thou seem&#8217;st a palace<br>
For the crown&#8217;d Truth to dwell in: I will
believe thee,<br>
And make my senses credit thy relation<br>
To points that seem impossible; for thou look&#8217;st<br>
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?<br>
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back&#8212;<br>
Which was when I perceived thee&#8212;that thou camest<br>
From good descending?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">So indeed I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Report thy parentage. I think thou
said&#8217;st<br>
Thou hadst been toss&#8217;d from wrong to injury,<br>
And that thou thought&#8217;st thy griefs might equal mine,<br>
If both were open&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Some such thing<br>
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts<br>
Did warrant me was likely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Tell thy story;<br>
If thine consider&#8217;d prove the thousandth part<br>
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I<br>
Have suffer&#8217;d like a girl: yet thou dost look<br>
Like Patience gazing on kings&#8217; graves, and smiling<br>
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?<br>
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?<br>
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">My name is Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, I am mock&#8217;d,<br>
And thou by some incensed god sent hither<br>
To make the world to laugh at me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good sir,<br>
Or here I&#8217;ll cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll be patient.<br>
Thou little know&#8217;st how thou dost startle me,<br>
To call thyself Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">The name<br>
Was given me by one that had some power,<br>
My father, and a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">How! a king&#8217;s daughter?<br>
And call&#8217;d Marina?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You said you would believe me;<br>
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,<br>
I will end here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But are you flesh and blood?<br>
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?<br>
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?<br>
And wherefore call&#8217;d Marina?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Call&#8217;d Marina<br>
For I was born at sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">At sea! what mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">My mother was the daughter of a king;<br>
Who died the minute I was born,<br>
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft<br>
Deliver&#8217;d weeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, stop there a little!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">This is the rarest dream that e&#8217;er dull
sleep<br>
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:<br>
My daughter&#8217;s buried. Well: where were you bred?<br>
I&#8217;ll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,<br>
And never interrupt you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">You scorn: believe me, &#8217;twere best I did
give o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I will believe you by the syllable<br>
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:<br>
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;<br>
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,<br>
Did seek to murder me: and having woo&#8217;d<br>
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do&#8217;t,<br>
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;<br>
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,<br>
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?<br>
It may be,<br>
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;<br>
I am the daughter to King Pericles,<br>
If good King Pericles be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, Helicanus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Calls my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,<br>
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,<br>
What this maid is, or what is like to be,<br>
That thus hath made me weep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">I know not; but<br>
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene<br>
Speaks nobly of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">She would never tell<br>
Her parentage; being demanded that,<br>
She would sit still and weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">O Helicanus, strike me, honour&#8217;d sir;<br>
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;<br>
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me<br>
O&#8217;erbear the shores of my mortality,<br>
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,<br>
Thou that beget&#8217;st him that did thee beget;<br>
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,<br>
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,<br>
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud<br>
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.<br>
What was thy mother&#8217;s name? tell me but that,<br>
For truth can never be confirm&#8217;d enough,<br>
Though doubts did ever sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">First, sir, I pray,<br>
What is your title?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now<br>
My drown&#8217;d queen&#8217;s name, as in the rest you said<br>
Thou hast been godlike perfect,<br>
The heir of kingdoms and another like<br>
To Pericles thy father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Is it no more to be your daughter than<br>
To say my mother&#8217;s name was Thaisa?<br>
Thaisa was my mother, who did end<br>
The minute I began.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my
child.<br>
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;<br>
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,<br>
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;<br>
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge<br>
She is thy very princess. Who is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, &#8217;tis the governor of Mytilene,<br>
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,<br>
Did come to see you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I embrace you.<br>
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.<br>
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?<br>
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him<br>
O&#8217;er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,<br>
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I hear none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">None!<br>
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">It is not good to cross him; give him way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I hear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Most heavenly music!<br>
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber<br>
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">A pillow for his head:<br>
So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,<br>
If this but answer to my just belief,<br>
I&#8217;ll well remember you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Pericles</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Diana appears to Pericles as
in a vision</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Diana</p>
<p class="speech">My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee
thither,<br>
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.<br>
There, when my maiden priests are met together,<br>
Before the people all,<br>
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:<br>
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter&#8217;s, call<br>
And give them repetition to the life.<br>
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;<br>
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!<br>
Awake, and tell thy dream.</p>

Lysimachus, and Marina</span></p>

<p class="speech">Sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>

The inhospitable Cleon; but I am<br>
For other service first: toward Ephesus<br>
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I&#8217;ll tell thee why.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lysimachus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,<br>
And give you gold for such provision<br>
As our intents will need?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,<br>
I have another suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">You shall prevail,<br>
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems<br>
You have been noble towards her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>

More a little, and then dumb.<br>
This, my last boon, give me,<br>
For such kindness must relieve me,<br>
That you aptly will suppose<br>
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,<br>
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,<br>
The regent made in Mytilene<br>
To greet the king. So he thrived,<br>
That he is promised to be wived<br>
To fair Marina; but in no wise<br>
Till he had done his sacrifice,<br>
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,<br>
The interim, pray you, all confound.<br>
In feather&#8217;d briefness sails are fill&#8217;d,<br>
And wishes fall out as they&#8217;re will&#8217;d.<br>
At Ephesus, the temple see,<br>
Our king and all his company.<br>
That he can hither come so soon,<br>
Is by your fancy&#8217;s thankful doom.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pericles, with his
train; Lysimachus, Helicanus, Marina, and a Lady</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,<br>
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;<br>
Who, frighted from my country, did wed<br>
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.<br>
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth<br>
A maid-child call&#8217;d Marina; who, O goddess,<br>
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus<br>
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years<br>
He sought to murder: but her better stars<br>
Brought her to Mytilene; &#8217;gainst whose shore<br>
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,<br>
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she<br>
Made known herself my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Voice and favour!<br>
You are, you are&#8212;O royal Pericles!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Faints</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">What means the nun? she dies! help,
gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">Noble sir,<br>
If you have told Diana&#8217;s altar true,<br>
This is your wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Reverend appearer, no;<br>
I threw her overboard with these very arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">Upon this coast, I warrant you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis most certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">Look to the lady; O, she&#8217;s but
o&#8217;erjoy&#8217;d.<br>
Early in blustering morn this lady was<br>
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,<br>
Found there rich jewels; recover&#8217;d her, and placed her<br>
Here in Diana&#8217;s temple.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">May we see them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">Great sir, they shall be brought you to my
house,<br>
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me look!<br>
If he be none of mine, my sanctity<br>
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,<br>
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,<br>
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,<br>
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,<br>
A birth, and death?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">The voice of dead Thaisa!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">That Thaisa am I, supposed dead<br>
And drown&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Immortal Dian!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now I know you better.<br>
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,<br>
The king my father gave you such a ring.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Shows a ring</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">This, this: no more, you gods! your present
kindness<br>
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,<br>
That on the touching of her lips I may<br>
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried<br>
A second time within these arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">My heart<br>
Leaps to be gone into my mother&#8217;s bosom.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels to Thaisa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh,
Thaisa;<br>
Thy burden at the sea, and call&#8217;d Marina<br>
For she was yielded there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Blest, and mine own!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, madam, and my queen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">I know you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">You have heard me say, when I did fly from
Tyre,<br>
I left behind an ancient substitute:<br>
Can you remember what I call&#8217;d the man?<br>
I have named him oft.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas Helicanus then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Still confirmation:<br>
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.<br>
Now do I long to hear how you were found;<br>
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,<br>
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,<br>
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can<br>
From first to last resolve you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Reverend sir,<br>
The gods can have no mortal officer<br>
More like a god than you. Will you deliver<br>
How this dead queen re-lives?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord.<br>
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,<br>
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;<br>
How she came placed here in the temple;<br>
No needful thing omitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I<br>
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,<br>
This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,<br>
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,<br>
This ornament<br>
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;<br>
And what this fourteen years no razor touch&#8217;d,<br>
To grace thy marriage-day, I&#8217;ll beautify.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit,
sir,<br>
My father&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my
queen,<br>
We&#8217;ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves<br>
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:<br>
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.<br>
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay<br>
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead&#8217;s the way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gower</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<br>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<br>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,<br>
Although assail&#8217;d with fortune fierce and keen,<br>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction&#8217;s blast,<br>
Led on by heaven, and crown&#8217;d with joy at last:<br>
In Helicanus may you well descry<br>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<br>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears<br>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<br>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<br>
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour&#8217;d name<br>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<br>
That him and his they in his palace burn;<br>
The gods for murder seemed so content<br>
To punish them; although not done, but meant.<br>
So, on your patience evermore attending,<br>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</p>
