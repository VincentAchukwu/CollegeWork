<h4>Prologue</h4>

<p class="speaker">Chorus</p>
<p class="speech">Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,<br>
And young affection gapes to be his heir;<br>
That fair for which love groan&#8217;d for and would die,<br>
With tender Juliet match&#8217;d, is now not fair.<br>
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,<br>
Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,<br>
But to his foe supposed he must complain,<br>
And she steal love&#8217;s sweet bait from fearful hooks:<br>
Being held a foe, he may not have access<br>
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;<br>
And she as much in love, her means much less<br>
To meet her new-beloved any where:<br>
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet<br>
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.</p>

<h4>Scene I. A lane by the wall of Capulet&#8217;s orchard.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Can I go forward when my heart is here?<br>
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He climbs the wall, and leaps
down within it</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Benvolio and
Mercutio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo! my cousin Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">He is wise;<br>
And, on my lie, hath stol&#8217;n him home to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">He ran this way, and leap&#8217;d this orchard
wall:<br>
Call, good Mercutio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll conjure too.<br>
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!<br>
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:<br>
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;<br>
Cry but &#8216;Ay me!&#8217; pronounce but &#8216;love&#8217; and
&#8216;dove;&#8217;<br>
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,<br>
One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,<br>
Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,<br>
When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!<br>
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;<br>
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.<br>
I conjure thee by Rosaline&#8217;s bright eyes,<br>
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,<br>
By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh<br>
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,<br>
That in thy likeness thou appear to us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">This cannot anger him: &#8217;twould anger
him<br>
To raise a spirit in his mistress&#8217; circle<br>
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand<br>
Till she had laid it and conjured it down;<br>
That were some spite: my invocation<br>
Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s&#8217; name<br>
I conjure only but to raise up him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,<br>
To be consorted with the humorous night:<br>
Blind is his love and best befits the dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.<br>
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,<br>
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit<br>
As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.<br>
Romeo, that she were, O, that she were<br>
An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!<br>
Romeo, good night: I&#8217;ll to my truckle-bed;<br>
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:<br>
Come, shall we go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Go, then; for &#8217;tis in
vain<br>
To seek him here that means not to be found.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Capulet&#8217;s orchard.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">He jests at scars that never felt a wound.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Juliet appears above at a
window</span></p>
<p class="speech">But, soft! what light through yonder window
breaks?<br>
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.<br>
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,<br>
Who is already sick and pale with grief,<br>
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:<br>
Be not her maid, since she is envious;<br>
Her vestal livery is but sick and green<br>
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.<br>
It is my lady, O, it is my love!<br>
O, that she knew she were!<br>
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?<br>
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.<br>
I am too bold, &#8217;tis not to me she speaks:<br>
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,<br>
Having some business, do entreat her eyes<br>
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.<br>
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?<br>
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,<br>
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven<br>
Would through the airy region stream so bright<br>
That birds would sing and think it were not night.<br>
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!<br>
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,<br>
That I might touch that cheek!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">She speaks:<br>
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art<br>
As glorious to this night, being o&#8217;er my head<br>
As is a winged messenger of heaven<br>
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes<br>
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him<br>
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds<br>
And sails upon the bosom of the air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?<br>
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;<br>
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,<br>
And I&#8217;ll no longer be a Capulet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Shall I hear
more, or shall I speak at this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis but thy name that is my enemy;<br>
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.<br>
What&#8217;s Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,<br>
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part<br>
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!<br>
What&#8217;s in a name? that which we call a rose<br>
By any other name would smell as sweet;<br>
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call&#8217;d,<br>
Retain that dear perfection which he owes<br>
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,<br>
And for that name which is no part of thee<br>
Take all myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I take thee at thy word:<br>
Call me but love, and I&#8217;ll be new baptized;<br>
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What man art thou that thus bescreen&#8217;d in
night<br>
So stumblest on my counsel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">By a name<br>
I know not how to tell thee who I am:<br>
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,<br>
Because it is an enemy to thee;<br>
Had I it written, I would tear the word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words<br>
Of that tongue&#8217;s utterance, yet I know the sound:<br>
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">How camest thou hither, tell me, and
wherefore?<br>
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,<br>
And the place death, considering who thou art,<br>
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">With love&#8217;s light wings did I
o&#8217;er-perch these walls;<br>
For stony limits cannot hold love out,<br>
And what love can do that dares love attempt;<br>
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">If they do see thee, they will murder thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye<br>
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,<br>
And I am proof against their enmity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I would not for the world they saw thee here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I have night&#8217;s cloak to hide me from their
sight;<br>
And but thou love me, let them find me here:<br>
My life were better ended by their hate,<br>
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">By whose direction found&#8217;st thou out this
place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;<br>
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.<br>
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far<br>
As that vast shore wash&#8217;d with the farthest sea,<br>
I would adventure for such merchandise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st the mask of night is on my
face,<br>
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek<br>
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night<br>
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny<br>
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!<br>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say &#8216;Ay,&#8217;<br>
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear&#8217;st,<br>
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers&#8217; perjuries<br>
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<br>
Or if thou think&#8217;st I am too quickly won,<br>
I&#8217;ll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,<br>
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>
And therefore thou mayst think my &#8217;havior light:<br>
But trust me, gentleman, I&#8217;ll prove more true<br>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>
But that thou overheard&#8217;st, ere I was ware,<br>
My true love&#8217;s passion: therefore pardon me,<br>
And not impute this yielding to light love,<br>
Which the dark night hath so discovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear<br>
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant
moon,<br>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br>
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I swear by?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Do not swear at all;<br>
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,<br>
Which is the god of my idolatry,<br>
And I&#8217;ll believe thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">If my heart&#8217;s dear love&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,<br>
I have no joy of this contract to-night:<br>
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;<br>
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be<br>
Ere one can say &#8216;It lightens.&#8217; Sweet, good night!<br>
This bud of love, by summer&#8217;s ripening breath,<br>
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.<br>
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest<br>
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">The exchange of thy love&#8217;s faithful vow for
mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I gave thee mine before thou didst request
it:<br>
And yet I would it were to give again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose,
love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">But to be frank, and give it thee again.<br>
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:<br>
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,<br>
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,<br>
The more I have, for both are infinite.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Nurse calls within</span></p>
<p class="speech">I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!<br>
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.<br>
Stay but a little, I will come again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.<br>
Being in night, all this is but a dream,<br>
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Juliet,
above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Three words, dear Romeo, and good night
indeed.<br>
If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,<br>
By one that I&#8217;ll procure to come to thee,<br>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;<br>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I&#8217;ll lay<br>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I come, anon.&#8212;But if thou mean&#8217;st not
well,<br>
I do beseech thee&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">By and by, I come:&#8212;<br>
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:<br>
To-morrow will I send.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">So thrive my soul&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand times good night!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand times the worse, to want thy
light.<br>
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,<br>
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Retiring</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Juliet,
above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer&#8217;s
voice,<br>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br>
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;<br>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,<br>
With repetition of my Romeo&#8217;s name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">It is my soul that calls upon my name:<br>
How silver-sweet sound lovers&#8217; tongues by night,<br>
Like softest music to attending ears!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My dear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At what o&#8217;clock to-morrow<br>
Shall I send to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">At the hour of nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I will not fail: &#8217;tis twenty years till
then.<br>
I have forgot why I did call thee back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Let me stand here till thou remember it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I shall forget, to have thee still stand
there,<br>
Remembering how I love thy company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll still stay, to have thee still
forget,<br>
Forgetting any other home but this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis almost morning; I would have thee
gone:<br>
And yet no further than a wanton&#8217;s bird;<br>
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,<br>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br>
So loving-jealous of his liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were thy bird.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet, so would I:<br>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,<br>
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy
breast!<br>
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!<br>
Hence will I to my ghostly father&#8217;s cell,<br>
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.</p>

<h4>Scene III. Friar Laurence&#8217;s cell.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Friar Laurence, with a
basket</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning
night,<br>
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br>
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<br>
From forth day&#8217;s path and Titan&#8217;s fiery wheels:<br>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br>
The day to cheer and night&#8217;s dank dew to dry,<br>
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<br>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br>
The earth that&#8217;s nature&#8217;s mother is her tomb;<br>
What is her burying grave that is her womb,<br>
And from her womb children of divers kind<br>
We sucking on her natural bosom find,<br>
Many for many virtues excellent,<br>
None but for some and yet all different.<br>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br>
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:<br>
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live<br>
But to the earth some special good doth give,<br>
Nor aught so good but strain&#8217;d from that fair use<br>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:<br>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;<br>
And vice sometimes by action dignified.<br>
Within the infant rind of this small flower<br>
Poison hath residence and medicine power:<br>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;<br>
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<br>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still<br>
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;<br>
And where the worser is predominant,<br>
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Benedicite!<br>
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?<br>
Young son, it argues a distemper&#8217;d head<br>
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:<br>
Care keeps his watch in every old man&#8217;s eye,<br>
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;<br>
But where unbruised youth with unstuff&#8217;d brain<br>
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:<br>
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<br>
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;<br>
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,<br>
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;<br>
I have forgot that name, and that name&#8217;s woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s my good son: but where hast thou
been, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell thee, ere thou ask it me
again.<br>
I have been feasting with mine enemy,<br>
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,<br>
That&#8217;s by me wounded: both our remedies<br>
Within thy help and holy physic lies:<br>
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,<br>
My intercession likewise steads my foe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;<br>
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Then plainly know my heart&#8217;s dear love is
set<br>
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:<br>
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;<br>
And all combined, save what thou must combine<br>
By holy marriage: when and where and how<br>
We met, we woo&#8217;d and made exchange of vow,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,<br>
That thou consent to marry us to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<br>
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,<br>
So soon forsaken? young men&#8217;s love then lies<br>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br>
Hath wash&#8217;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br>
How much salt water thrown away in waste,<br>
To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br>
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;<br>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br>
Of an old tear that is not wash&#8217;d off yet:<br>
If e&#8217;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,<br>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:<br>
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,<br>
Women may fall, when there&#8217;s no strength in men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou chid&#8217;st me oft for loving
Rosaline.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And bad&#8217;st me bury love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Not in a grave,<br>

Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;<br>
The other did not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">O, she knew well<br>
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.<br>
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,<br>
In one respect I&#8217;ll thy assistant be;<br>
For this alliance may so happy prove,<br>
To turn your households&#8217; rancour to pure love.</p>

<h4>Scene IV. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Benvolio and
Mercutio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Where the devil should this Romeo be?<br>
Came he not home to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Not to his father&#8217;s; I spoke with his
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that
Rosaline.<br>
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,<br>
Hath sent a letter to his father&#8217;s house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo will answer it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Any man that can write may answer a letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he will answer the letter&#8217;s master,
how he
dares, being dared.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with
a
white wench&#8217;s black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy&#8217;s butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he
is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">The what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! &#8216;By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!&#8217; Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi&#8217;s, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh,
flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there&#8217;s a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I
give you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">The ship, sir, the slip; can you not
conceive?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and
in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as much as to say, such a case as
yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Meaning, to court&#8217;sy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast most kindly hit it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Pink for flower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then is my pump well flowered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Well said: follow me this jest now till thou
hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits
faint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I&#8217;ll
cry a match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I
have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou
wast
not there for the goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good goose, bite not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a
most
sharp sauce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And is it not well served in to a sweet
goose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O here&#8217;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches
from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I stretch it out for that word
&#8216;broad;&#8217; which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, is not this better now than groaning for
love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Stop there, stop there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the
hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou art deceived; I would have made it
short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s goodly gear!</p>

<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Is it good den?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy
hand of the

<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Out upon you! what a man are you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself
to
mar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, it is well said; &#8216;for himself
to mar,&#8217;
quoth a&#8217;? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older
when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">You say well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i&#8217;
faith;
wisely, wisely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence
with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">She will indite him to some supper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What hast thou found?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten
pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">An old hare hoar,<br>
And an old hare hoar,<br>
&emsp;Is very good meat in lent<br>
But a hare that is hoar<br>
Is too much for a score,<br>
&emsp;When it hoars ere it be spent.</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo, will you come to your father&#8217;s? we&#8217;ll
to dinner, thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I will follow you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Singing</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Lady, lady, lady.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mercutio and
Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself
talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">An a&#8217; speak any thing against me,
I&#8217;ll take him
down, an a&#8217; were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I&#8217;ll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my
weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part
about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool&#8217;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Good heart, and, i&#8217; faith, I will tell her
as much:<br>
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not
mark me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which,
as<br>
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Bid her devise<br>
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;<br>
And there she shall at Friar Laurence&#8217; cell<br>
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">No truly sir; not a penny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; I say you shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be
there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:<br>
Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br>
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;<br>
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy<br>
Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br>
Farewell; be trusty, and I&#8217;ll quit thy pains:<br>
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, my dear nurse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Is your man secret? Did you ne&#8217;er hear
say,<br>
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant thee, my man&#8217;s as true as
steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest
lady&#8212;Lord,
Lord! when &#8217;twas a little prating thing:&#8212;O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I&#8217;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ah. mocker! that&#8217;s the dog&#8217;s name; R
is for
the&#8212;No; I know it begins with some other
letter:&#8212;and she hath the prettiest sententious of
it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
to hear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to thy lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, a thousand times.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Romeo</span></p>

Which ten times faster glide than the sun&#8217;s beams,<br>
Driving back shadows over louring hills:<br>
Therefore do nimble-pinion&#8217;d doves draw love,<br>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br>
Of this day&#8217;s journey, and from nine till twelve<br>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.<br>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<br>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br>

breath<br>
To say to me that thou art out of breath?<br>
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay<br>

Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;<br>
Say either, and I&#8217;ll stay the circumstance:<br>
Let me be satisfied, is&#8217;t good or bad?</p>

not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man&#8217;s, yet his leg excels
all men&#8217;s; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I&#8217;ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?</p>
