<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish of trumpets: then
hautboys. Enter King Henry VI, Gloucester, Salisbury, Warwick, and
Cardinal, on the one side; Queen Margaret, Suffolk, York, Somerset,
and Buckingham, on the other</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">As by your high imperial majesty<br>
I had in charge at my depart for France,<br>
As procurator to your excellence,<br>
To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,<br>
So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,<br>
In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,<br>
The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,<br>
Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,<br>
I have perform&#8217;d my task and was espoused:<br>
And humbly now upon my bended knee,<br>
In sight of England and her lordly peers,<br>
Deliver up my title in the queen<br>
To your most gracious hands, that are the substance<br>
Of that great shadow I did represent;<br>
The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,<br>
The fairest queen that ever king received.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:<br>
I can express no kinder sign of love<br>
Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,<br>
Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!<br>
For thou hast given me in this beauteous face<br>
A world of earthly blessings to my soul,<br>
If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Great King of England and my gracious lord,<br>
The mutual conference that my mind hath had,<br>
By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,<br>
In courtly company or at my beads,<br>
With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,<br>
Makes me the bolder to salute my king<br>
With ruder terms, such as my wit affords<br>
And over-joy of heart doth minister.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Her sight did ravish; but her grace in
speech,<br>
Her words y-clad with wisdom&#8217;s majesty,<br>
Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;<br>
Such is the fulness of my heart&#8217;s content.<br>
Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> Long live
Queen Margaret, England&#8217;s
happiness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">We thank you all.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">My lord protector, so it please your grace,<br>
Here are the articles of contracted peace<br>
Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,<br>
For eighteen months concluded by consent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Imprimis, it is agreed between the French
king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of
Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that
the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and
Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the
thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy
of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
and delivered to the king her father&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lets the paper
fall</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Uncle, how now!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Pardon me, gracious lord;<br>
Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart<br>
And dimm&#8217;d mine eyes, that I can read no further.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;Item,
It is further agreed between them,
that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
released and delivered over to the king her father,
and she sent over of the King of England&#8217;s own
proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel
down:<br>
We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,<br>
And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,<br>
We here discharge your grace from being regent<br>
I&#8217; the parts of France, till term of eighteen months<br>
Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,<br>
Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,<br>
Salisbury, and Warwick;<br>
We thank you all for the great favour done,<br>
In entertainment to my princely queen.<br>
Come, let us in, and with all speed provide<br>
To see her coronation be perform&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Henry VI, Queen
Margaret, and Suffolk</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,<br>
To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,<br>
Your grief, the common grief of all the land.<br>
What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,<br>
His valour, coin and people, in the wars?<br>
Did he so often lodge in open field,<br>
In winter&#8217;s cold and summer&#8217;s parching heat,<br>
To conquer France, his true inheritance?<br>
And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,<br>
To keep by policy what Henry got?<br>
Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,<br>
Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,<br>
Received deep scars in France and Normandy?<br>
Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,<br>
With all the learned council of the realm,<br>
Studied so long, sat in the council-house<br>
Early and late, debating to and fro<br>
How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,<br>
And had his highness in his infancy<br>
Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?<br>
And shall these labours and these honours die?<br>
Shall Henry&#8217;s conquest, Bedford&#8217;s vigilance,<br>
Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?<br>
O peers of England, shameful is this league!<br>
Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,<br>
Blotting your names from books of memory,<br>
Razing the characters of your renown,<br>
Defacing monuments of conquer&#8217;d France,<br>
Undoing all, as all had never been!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,<br>
This peroration with such circumstance?<br>
For France, &#8217;tis ours; and we will keep it still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;<br>
But now it is impossible we should:<br>
Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,<br>
Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine<br>
Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style<br>
Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the death of Him that died for all,<br>
These counties were the keys of Normandy.<br>
But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">For grief that they are past recovery:<br>
For, were there hope to conquer them again,<br>
My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.<br>
Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;<br>
Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:<br>
And are the cities, that I got with wounds,<br>
Delivered up again with peaceful words?<br>
Mort Dieu!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">For Suffolk&#8217;s duke, may he be
suffocate,<br>
That dims the honour of this warlike isle!<br>
France should have torn and rent my very heart,<br>
Before I would have yielded to this league.<br>
I never read but England&#8217;s kings have had<br>
Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:<br>
And our King Henry gives away his own,<br>
To match with her that brings no vantages.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">A proper jest, and never heard before,<br>
That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth<br>
For costs and charges in transporting her!<br>
She should have stayed in France and starved<br>
in France, Before&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:<br>
It was the pleasure of my lord the King.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;<br>
&#8217;Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,<br>
But &#8217;tis my presence that doth trouble ye.<br>
Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face<br>
I see thy fury: if I longer stay,<br>
We shall begin our ancient bickerings.<br>
Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,<br>
I prophesied France will be lost ere long.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">So, there goes our protector in a rage.<br>
&#8217;Tis known to you he is mine enemy,<br>
Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,<br>
And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.<br>
Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,<br>
And heir apparent to the English crown:<br>
Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,<br>
And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,<br>
There&#8217;s reason he should be displeased at it.<br>
Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words<br>
Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.<br>
What though the common people favour him,<br>
Calling him &#8216;Humphrey, the good Duke of<br>
Gloucester,&#8217;<br>
Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,<br>
&#8216;Jesu maintain your royal excellence!&#8217;<br>
With &#8216;God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!&#8217;<br>
I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,<br>
He will be found a dangerous protector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,<br>
He being of age to govern of himself?<br>
Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,<br>
And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,<br>
We&#8217;ll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">This weighty business will not brook delay:<br>
I&#8217;ll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey&#8217;s
pride<br>
And greatness of his place be grief to us,<br>
Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:<br>
His insolence is more intolerable<br>
Than all the princes in the land beside:<br>
If Gloucester be displaced, he&#8217;ll be protector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,<br>
Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Buckingham and
Somerset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Pride went before, ambition follows him.<br>
While these do labour for their own preferment,<br>
Behoves it us to labour for the realm.<br>
I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester<br>
Did bear him like a noble gentleman.<br>
Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,<br>
More like a soldier than a man o&#8217; the church,<br>
As stout and proud as he were lord of all,<br>
Swear like a ruffian and demean himself<br>
Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.<br>
Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,<br>
Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,<br>
Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,<br>
Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:<br>
And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,<br>
In bringing them to civil discipline,<br>
Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,<br>
When thou wert regent for our sovereign,<br>
Have made thee fear&#8217;d and honour&#8217;d of the people:<br>
Join we together, for the public good,<br>
In what we can, to bridle and suppress<br>
The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,<br>
With Somerset&#8217;s and Buckingham&#8217;s ambition;<br>
And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey&#8217;s deeds,<br>
While they do tend the profit of the land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,<br>
And common profit of his country!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And so says
York, for he hath greatest cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Then let&#8217;s make haste away, and look unto
the main.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;<br>
That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,<br>
And would have kept so long as breath did last!<br>
Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,<br>
Which I will win from France, or else be slain,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Warwick and
Salisbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Anjou and Maine are given to the French;<br>
Paris is lost; the state of Normandy<br>
Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:<br>
Suffolk concluded on the articles,<br>
The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased<br>
To change two dukedoms for a duke&#8217;s fair daughter.<br>
I cannot blame them all: what is&#8217;t to them?<br>
&#8217;Tis thine they give away, and not their own.<br>
Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage<br>
And purchase friends and give to courtezans,<br>
Still revelling like lords till all be gone;<br>
While as the silly owner of the goods<br>
Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands<br>
And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,<br>
While all is shared and all is borne away,<br>
Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:<br>
So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,<br>
While his own lands are bargain&#8217;d for and sold.<br>
Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland<br>
Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood<br>
As did the fatal brand Althaea burn&#8217;d<br>
Unto the prince&#8217;s heart of Calydon.<br>
Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!<br>
Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,<br>
Even as I have of fertile England&#8217;s soil.<br>
A day will come when York shall claim his own;<br>
And therefore I will take the Nevils&#8217; parts<br>
And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,<br>
And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,<br>
For that&#8217;s the golden mark I seek to hit:<br>
Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,<br>
Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,<br>
Nor wear the diadem upon his head,<br>
Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.<br>
Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:<br>
Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,<br>
To pry into the secrets of the state;<br>
Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,<br>
With his new bride and England&#8217;s dear-bought queen,<br>
And Humphrey with the peers be fall&#8217;n at jars:<br>
Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,<br>
With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;<br>
And in my standard bear the arms of York<br>
To grapple with the house of Lancaster;<br>
And, force perforce, I&#8217;ll make him yield the crown,<br>
Whose bookish rule hath pull&#8217;d fair England down.</p>

Duchess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Why droops my lord, like over-ripen&#8217;d
corn,<br>
Hanging the head at Ceres&#8217; plenteous load?<br>
Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,<br>
As frowning at the favours of the world?<br>
Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,<br>
Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?<br>
What seest thou there? King Henry&#8217;s diadem,<br>
Enchased with all the honours of the world?<br>
If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,<br>
Until thy head be circled with the same.<br>
Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.<br>
What, is&#8217;t too short? I&#8217;ll lengthen it with mine:<br>
And, having both together heaved it up,<br>
We&#8217;ll both together lift our heads to heaven,<br>
And never more abase our sight so low<br>
As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy
lord,<br>
Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.<br>
And may that thought, when I imagine ill<br>
Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,<br>
Be my last breathing in this mortal world!<br>
My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">What dream&#8217;d my lord? tell me, and
I&#8217;ll requite it<br>
With sweet rehearsal of my morning&#8217;s dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Methought this staff, mine office-badge in
court,<br>
Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,<br>
But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;<br>
And on the pieces of the broken wand<br>
Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,<br>
And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.<br>
This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, this was nothing but an argument<br>
That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester&#8217;s grove<br>
Shall lose his head for his presumption.<br>
But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:<br>
Methought I sat in seat of majesty<br>
In the cathedral church of Westminster,<br>
And in that chair where kings and queens are crown&#8217;d;<br>
Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel&#8217;d to me<br>
And on my head did set the diadem.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:<br>
Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,<br>
Art thou not second woman in the realm,<br>
And the protector&#8217;s wife, beloved of him?<br>
Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,<br>
Above the reach or compass of thy thought?<br>
And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,<br>
To tumble down thy husband and thyself<br>
From top of honour to disgrace&#8217;s feet?<br>
Away from me, and let me hear no more!</p>

Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:<br>
The business asketh silent secrecy.<br>
Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:<br>
Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.<br>
Yet have I gold flies from another coast;<br>
I dare not say, from the rich cardinal<br>
And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,<br>
Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,<br>
They, knowing Dame Eleanor&#8217;s aspiring humour,<br>
Have hired me to undermine the duchess<br>
And buz these conjurations in her brain.<br>
They say &#8216;A crafty knave does need no broker;&#8217;<br>
Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal&#8217;s broker.<br>
Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near<br>
To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.<br>
Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last<br>
Hume&#8217;s knavery will be the duchess&#8217; wreck,<br>
And her attainture will be Humphrey&#8217;s fall:<br>
Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.</p>

His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves<br>
Are brazen images of canonized saints.<br>

Well, to the rest:<br>
&#8216;Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?<br>
By water shall he die, and take his end.<br>
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?<br>
Let him shun castles;<br>
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains<br>
Than where castles mounted stand.&#8217;<br>
Come, come, my lords;<br>
These oracles are hardly attain&#8217;d,<br>
And hardly understood.<br>
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban&#8217;s,<br>

<p class="speech">Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,<br>
I saw not better sport these seven years&#8217; day:<br>

<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>

<p class="speech">No marvel, an it like your majesty,<br>

Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them
all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his
cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple

sirrah,
if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me
over this stool and run away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simpcox</p>

You go about to torture me in vain.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Beadle with
whips</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, we must have you find your legs.
Sirrah

<p class="speaker">Beadle</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with
your
doublet quickly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simpcox</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to
stand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">After the Beadle hath hit him
once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and
cry, &#8216;A miracle!&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,<br>
Our simple supper ended, give me leave<br>
In this close walk to satisfy myself,<br>
In craving your opinion of my title,<br>
Which is infallible, to England&#8217;s crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I long to hear it at full.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,<br>
The Nevils are thy subjects to command.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus:<br>
Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:<br>
The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;<br>
The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,<br>
Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom<br>
Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;<br>
The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;<br>
The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;<br>
William of Windsor was the seventh and last.<br>
Edward the Black Prince died before his father<br>
And left behind him Richard, his only son,<br>
Who after Edward the Third&#8217;s death reign&#8217;d as king;<br>
Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,<br>
The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,<br>
Crown&#8217;d by the name of Henry the Fourth,<br>
Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,<br>
Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,<br>
And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,<br>
Harmless Richard was murder&#8217;d traitorously.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Father, the duke hath told the truth:<br>
Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Which now they hold by force and not by
right;<br>
For Richard, the first son&#8217;s heir, being dead,<br>
The issue of the next son should have reign&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">But William of Hatfield died without an heir.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose
line<br>
I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,<br>
Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:<br>
Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;<br>
Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,<br>
As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;<br>
And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,<br>
Who kept him in captivity till he died.<br>
But to the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;His eldest sister, Anne,<br>
My mother, being heir unto the crown<br>
Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son<br>
To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third&#8217;s fifth son.<br>
By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir<br>
To Roger Earl of March, who was the son<br>
Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,<br>
Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:<br>
So, if the issue of the elder son<br>
Succeed before the younger, I am king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">What plain proceeding is more plain than
this?<br>
Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,<br>
The fourth son; York claims it from the third.<br>
Till Lionel&#8217;s issue fails, his should not reign:<br>
It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee<br>
And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.<br>
Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;<br>
And in this private plot be we the first<br>
That shall salute our rightful sovereign<br>
With honour of his birthright to the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Long live our sovereign Richard, England&#8217;s
king!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">We thank you, lords. But I am not your king<br>
Till I be crown&#8217;d and that my sword be stain&#8217;d<br>
With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;<br>
And that&#8217;s not suddenly to be perform&#8217;d,<br>
But with advice and silent secrecy.<br>
Do you as I do in these dangerous days:<br>
Wink at the Duke of Suffolk&#8217;s insolence,<br>
At Beaufort&#8217;s pride, at Somerset&#8217;s ambition,<br>
At Buckingham and all the crew of them,<br>
Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,<br>
That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:<br>
&#8217;Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that<br>
Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, break we off; we know your mind at
full.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick<br>

In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:<br>
Receive the sentence of the law for sins<br>
Such as by God&#8217;s book are adjudged to death.<br>
You four, from hence to prison back again;<br>
From thence unto the place of execution:<br>
The witch in Smithfield shall be burn&#8217;d to ashes,<br>
And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.<br>
You, madam, for you are more nobly born,<br>
Despoiled of your honour in your life,<br>
Shall, after three days&#8217; open penance done,<br>
Live in your country here in banishment,<br>
With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.</p>

Than when thou wert protector to thy King.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I see no reason why a king of years<br>
Should be to be protected like a child.<br>
God and King Henry govern England&#8217;s realm.<br>
Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:<br>
As willingly do I the same resign<br>
As e&#8217;er thy father Henry made it mine;<br>
And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it<br>
As others would ambitiously receive it.<br>
Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,<br>
May honourable peace attend thy throne!</p>

To watch the coming of my punish&#8217;d duchess:<br>
Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,<br>
To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.<br>
Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook<br>
The abject people gazing on thy face,<br>
With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,<br>
That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels<br>
When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.<br>
But, soft! I think she comes; and I&#8217;ll prepare<br>
My tear-stain&#8217;d eyes to see her miseries.</p>

Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!<br>
See how the giddy multitude do point,<br>
And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!<br>
Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,<br>
And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,<br>
And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!<br>
For whilst I think I am thy married wife<br>
And thou a prince, protector of this land,<br>
Methinks I should not thus be led along,<br>
Mail&#8217;d up in shame, with papers on my back,<br>
And followed with a rabble that rejoice<br>
To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.<br>
The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,<br>
And when I start, the envious people laugh<br>
And bid me be advised how I tread.<br>
Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?<br>
Trow&#8217;st thou that e&#8217;er I&#8217;ll look upon the
world,<br>
Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?<br>
No; dark shall be my light and night my day;<br>
To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.<br>
Sometime I&#8217;ll say, I am Duke Humphrey&#8217;s wife,<br>
And he a prince and ruler of the land:<br>
Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was<br>
As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,<br>
Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock<br>
To every idle rascal follower.<br>
But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,<br>
Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death<br>
Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;<br>
For Suffolk, he that can do all in all<br>
With her that hateth thee and hates us all,<br>
And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,<br>
Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,<br>
And, fly thou how thou canst, they&#8217;ll tangle thee:<br>
But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,<br>
Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;<br>
I must offend before I be attainted;<br>
And had I twenty times so many foes,<br>
And each of them had twenty times their power,<br>
All these could not procure me any scathe,<br>
So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.<br>
Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?<br>
Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away<br>
But I in danger for the breach of law.<br>
Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:<br>

The strangeness of his alter&#8217;d countenance?<br>
With what a majesty he bears himself,<br>
How insolent of late he is become,<br>
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?<br>
We know the time since he was mild and affable,<br>
And if we did but glance a far-off look,<br>
Immediately he was upon his knee,<br>
That all the court admired him for submission:<br>
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,<br>
When every one will give the time of day,<br>
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,<br>
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,<br>
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.<br>
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;<br>
But great men tremble when the lion roars;<br>
And Humphrey is no little man in England.<br>
First note that he is near you in descent,<br>
And should you fall, he as the next will mount.<br>
Me seemeth then it is no policy,<br>
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears<br>
And his advantage following your decease,<br>
That he should come about your royal person<br>
Or be admitted to your highness&#8217; council.<br>
By flattery hath he won the commons&#8217; hearts,<br>
And when he please to make commotion,<br>
&#8217;Tis to be fear&#8217;d they all will follow him.<br>
Now &#8217;tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;<br>
Suffer them now, and they&#8217;ll o&#8217;ergrow the garden<br>
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.<br>
The reverent care I bear unto my lord<br>
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.<br>
If it be fond, call it a woman&#8217;s fear;<br>
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,<br>
I will subscribe and say I wrong&#8217;d the duke.<br>

And, had I first been put to speak my mind,<br>

The duchess, by his subornation,<br>
Upon my life, began her devilish practises:<br>
Or, if he were not privy to those faults,<br>
Yet, by reputing of his high descent,<br>
As next the king he was successive heir,<br>
And such high vaunts of his nobility,<br>
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess<br>
By wicked means to frame our sovereign&#8217;s fall.<br>
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;<br>
And in his simple show he harbours treason.<br>
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.<br>
No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man<br>
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>

Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent<br>
From meaning treason to our royal person<br>
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:<br>

Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes

And, being protector, stayed the soldiers&#8217; pay;<br>
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.</p>

<p class="speech">Is it but thought so? what are they that think

So help me God, as I have watch&#8217;d the night,<br>
Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,<br>
That doit that e&#8217;er I wrested from the king,<br>
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,<br>
Be brought against me at my trial-day!<br>
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,<br>
Because I would not tax the needy commons,<br>
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,<br>
And never ask&#8217;d for restitution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I say no more than truth, so help me God!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">In your protectorship you did devise<br>
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,<br>
That England was defamed by tyranny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis well known that, whiles I was
protector,<br>
Pity was all the fault that was in me;<br>
For I should melt at an offender&#8217;s tears,<br>
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.<br>
Unless it were a bloody murderer,<br>
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,<br>
I never gave them condign punishment:<br>
Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured<br>
Above the felon or what trespass else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, these faults are easy, quickly
answered:<br>
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,<br>
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.<br>
I do arrest you in his highness&#8217; name;<br>
And here commit you to my lord cardinal<br>
To keep, until your further time of trial.</p>

My conscience tells me you are innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:<br>
Virtue is choked with foul ambition<br>
And charity chased hence by rancour&#8217;s hand;<br>
Foul subornation is predominant<br>
And equity exiled your highness&#8217; land.<br>
I know their complot is to have my life,<br>
And if my death might make this island happy,<br>
And prove the period of their tyranny,<br>
I would expend it with all willingness:<br>
But mine is made the prologue to their play;<br>
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,<br>
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.<br>
Beaufort&#8217;s red sparkling eyes blab his heart&#8217;s
malice,<br>
And Suffolk&#8217;s cloudy brow his stormy hate;<br>
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue<br>
The envious load that lies upon his heart;<br>
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,<br>
Whose overweening arm I have pluck&#8217;d back,<br>
By false accuse doth level at my life:<br>
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,<br>
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,<br>
And with your best endeavour have stirr&#8217;d up<br>
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:<br>
Ay, all you have laid your heads together&#8212;<br>
Myself had notice of your conventicles&#8212;<br>
And all to make away my guiltless life.<br>
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,<br>

Before his legs be firm to bear his body.<br>
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,<br>

For what&#8217;s more miserable than discontent?<br>
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see<br>
The map of honour, truth and loyalty:<br>
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come<br>
That e&#8217;er I proved thee false or fear&#8217;d thy faith.<br>
What louring star now envies thy estate,<br>
That these great lords and Margaret our queen<br>
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?<br>
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;<br>
And as the butcher takes away the calf<br>
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,<br>
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,<br>
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;<br>
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,<br>
Looking the way her harmless young one went,<br>
And can do nought but wail her darling&#8217;s loss,<br>
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester&#8217;s case<br>

Look after him and cannot do him good,<br>
So mighty are his vowed enemies.<br>

Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,<br>
Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester&#8217;s show<br>
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile<br>
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,<br>
Or as the snake roll&#8217;d in a flowering bank,<br>
With shining chequer&#8217;d slough, doth sting a child<br>
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.<br>
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I&#8212;<br>

His guilt should be but idly posted over,<br>
Because his purpose is not executed.<br>
No; let him die, in that he is a fox,<br>
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,<br>
Before his chaps be stain&#8217;d with crimson blood,<br>
As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.<br>
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:<br>
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,<br>
Sleeping or waking, &#8217;tis no matter how,<br>

Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</p>

The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms<br>
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:<br>
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,<br>
Collected choicely, from each county some,<br>
And try your hap against the Irishmen?</p>

<p class="speech">I will, my lord, so please his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Why, our authority is his consent,<br>
And what we do establish he confirms:<br>
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,<br>
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>

perform&#8217;d.<br>
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">No more of him; for I will deal with him<br>
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.<br>
And so break off; the day is almost spent:<br>
Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days<br>
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;<br>
For there I&#8217;ll ship them all for Ireland.</p>

And change misdoubt to resolution:<br>
Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art<br>
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:<br>
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,<br>
And find no harbour in a royal heart.<br>
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
on thought,<br>
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.<br>
My brain more busy than the labouring spider<br>
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.<br>
Well, nobles, well, &#8217;tis politicly done,<br>
To send me packing with an host of men:<br>
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,<br>
Who, cherish&#8217;d in your breasts, will sting
your hearts.<br>
&#8217;Twas men I lack&#8217;d and you will give them me:<br>
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured<br>
You put sharp weapons in a madman&#8217;s hands.<br>
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,<br>
I will stir up in England some black storm<br>
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;<br>
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage<br>
Until the golden circuit on my head,<br>
Like to the glorious sun&#8217;s transparent beams,<br>
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.<br>
And, for a minister of my intent,<br>
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,<br>
John Cade of Ashford,<br>
To make commotion, as full well he can,<br>
Under the title of John Mortimer.<br>
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade<br>
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,<br>
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts<br>
Were almost like a sharp-quill&#8217;d porpentine;<br>
And, in the end being rescued, I have seen<br>
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,<br>
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.<br>
Full often, like a shag-hair&#8217;d crafty kern,<br>
Hath he conversed with the enemy,<br>
And undiscover&#8217;d come to me again<br>
And given me notice of their villanies.<br>
This devil here shall be my substitute;<br>
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,<br>
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:<br>
By this I shall perceive the commons&#8217; mind,<br>
How they affect the house and claim of York.<br>
Say he be taken, rack&#8217;d and tortured,<br>
I know no pain they can inflict upon him<br>
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.<br>
Say that he thrive, as &#8217;tis great like he will,<br>
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength<br>
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&#8217;d;<br>
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,<br>
And Henry put apart, the next for me.</p>

And twice by awkward wind from England&#8217;s bank<br>
Drove back again unto my native clime?<br>
What boded this, but well forewarning wind<br>
Did seem to say &#8216;seek not a scorpion&#8217;s nest,<br>
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore&#8217;?<br>
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts<br>
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:<br>
And bid them blow towards England&#8217;s blessed shore,<br>
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock<br>
Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,<br>
But left that hateful office unto thee:<br>
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,<br>
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown&#8217;d on shore,<br>
With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:<br>
The splitting rocks cower&#8217;d in the sinking sands<br>
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,<br>
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,<br>
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.<br>
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,<br>
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,<br>
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,<br>
And when the dusky sky began to rob<br>
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land&#8217;s view,<br>
I took a costly jewel from my neck,<br>
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,<br>
And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,<br>
And so I wish&#8217;d thy body might my heart:<br>
And even with this I lost fair England&#8217;s view<br>
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart<br>
And call&#8217;d them blind and dusky spectacles,<br>
For losing ken of Albion&#8217;s wished coast.<br>
How often have I tempted Suffolk&#8217;s tongue,<br>
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,<br>
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did<br>
When he to madding Dido would unfold<br>
His father&#8217;s acts commenced in burning Troy!<br>
Am I not witch&#8217;d like her? or thou not false like him?<br>

Like to the summer&#8217;s corn by tempest lodged.<br>
It cannot be but he was murder&#8217;d here;<br>
The least of all these signs were probable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to
death?<br>
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;<br>

Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?<br>
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where&#8217;s your

<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;<br>
But here&#8217;s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,<br>
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart<br>
That slanders me with murder&#8217;s crimson badge.<br>

Dying with mother&#8217;s dug between its lips:<br>
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,<br>
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,<br>

rough,<br>

Far be it we should honour such as these<br>
With humble suit: no, rather let my head<br>
Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any<br>
Save to the God of heaven and to my king;<br>
And sooner dance upon a bloody pole<br>
Than stand uncover&#8217;d to the vulgar groom.<br>

More can I bear than you dare execute.</p>

A Roman sworder and banditto slave<br>
Murder&#8217;d sweet Tully; Brutus&#8217; bastard hand<br>
Stabb&#8217;d Julius Caesar; savage islanders<br>
Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.</p>

fire, being burnt i&#8217; the hand for stealing of sheep.</p>

reformation. There shall be in England seven

lamentable
thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
o&#8217;er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:
but I say, &#8217;tis the bee&#8217;s wax; for I did but seal

<p class="speaker">Cade</p>

he is but a knight, is a&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Michael</p>

Mark&#8217;d for the gallows, lay your weapons down;<br>
Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:<br>
The king is merciful, if you revolt.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Stafford</p>
<p class="speech">But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,<br>
If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass
not:<br>
It is to you, good people, that I speak,<br>
Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;<br>
For I am rightful heir unto the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Humphrey</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thy father was a plasterer;<br>
And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">And Adam was a gardener.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Stafford</p>
<p class="speech">And what of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.<br>
Married the Duke of Clarence&#8217; daughter, did he not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Humphrey</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">By her he had two children at one birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Stafford</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there&#8217;s the question; but I say,
&#8217;tis true:<br>
The elder of them, being put to nurse,<br>
Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;<br>
And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,<br>
Became a bricklayer when he came to age:<br>
His son am I; deny it, if you can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dick</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;tis too true; therefore he shall be
king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Smith</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he made a chimney in my father&#8217;s
house, and
the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;
therefore deny it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Humphrey</p>
<p class="speech">And will you credit this base drudge&#8217;s
words,<br>
That speaks he knows not what?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Stafford</p>
<p class="speech">Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you
this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He lies, for I
invented it myself.<br>
Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his
father&#8217;s sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys
went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content
he shall reign; but I&#8217;ll be protector over him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dick</p>
<p class="speech">And furthermore, well have the Lord Say&#8217;s
head for
selling the dukedom of Maine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">And good reason; for thereby is England mained,
and
fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds
it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say
hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:
and more than that, he can speak French; and
therefore he is a traitor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Humphrey</p>
<p class="speech">O gross and miserable ignorance!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are
our
enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
counsellor, or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; and therefore we&#8217;ll have his
head.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Stafford</p>
<p class="speech">Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,<br>
Assail them with the army of the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Humphrey</p>
<p class="speech">Herald, away; and throughout every town<br>
Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;<br>
That those which fly before the battle ends<br>
May, even in their wives&#8217; and children&#8217;s sight,<br>
Be hang&#8217;d up for example at their doors:<br>
And you that be the king&#8217;s friends, follow me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt William Stafford and
Sir Humphrey, and soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cade</p>
<p class="speech">And you that love the commons, follow me.<br>
Now show yourselves men; &#8217;tis for liberty.<br>
We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:<br>
Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;<br>
For they are thrifty honest men, and such<br>
As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dick</p>
<p class="speech">They are all in order and march toward us.</p>

Ah,
thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now
art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for
giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the
dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these
presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I
am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously
corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
had no other books but the score and the tally, thou
hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to
the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a
paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou
hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian
ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed
justices of peace, to call poor men before them
about matters they were not able to answer.
Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because
they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,
indeed, only for that cause they have been most
worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?</p>

The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;<br>
Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.<br>
I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,<br>
Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.<br>
Justice with favour have I always done;<br>
Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.<br>
When have I aught exacted at your hands,<br>
But to maintain the king, the realm and you?<br>
Large gifts have I bestow&#8217;d on learned clerks,<br>

But I must make fair weather yet a while,<br>
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,&#8212;<br>
Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,<br>
That I have given no answer all this while;<br>
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.<br>
The cause why I have brought this army hither<br>
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,<br>
Seditious to his grace and to the state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">That is too much presumption on thy part:<br>
But if thy arms be to no other end,<br>
The king hath yielded unto thy demand:<br>
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.<br>
Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;<br>
Meet me to-morrow in St. George&#8217;s field,<br>
You shall have pay and every thing you wish.<br>
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,<br>
Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,<br>
As pledges of my fealty and love;<br>
I&#8217;ll send them all as willing as I live:<br>
Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,<br>
Is his to use, so Somerset may die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">York, I commend this kind submission:<br>
We twain will go into his highness&#8217; tent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry VI and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,<br>
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">In all submission and humility<br>
York doth present himself unto your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Then what intends these forces thou dost
bring?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,<br>
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,<br>
Who since I heard to be discomfited.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Iden, with Cade&#8217;s
head</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">If one so rude and of so mean condition<br>
May pass into the presence of a king,<br>
Lo, I present your grace a traitor&#8217;s head,<br>
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">The head of Cade! Great God, how just art
Thou!<br>
O, let me view his visage, being dead,<br>
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.<br>
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">I was, an&#8217;t like your majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">How art thou call&#8217;d? and what is thy
degree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">Alexander Iden, that&#8217;s my name;<br>
A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">So please it you, my lord, &#8217;twere not
amiss<br>
He were created knight for his good service.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Iden, kneel down.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He kneels</span></p>
<p class="speech">Rise up a knight.<br>
We give thee for reward a thousand marks,<br>
And will that thou henceforth attend on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">May Iden live to merit such a bounty.<br>
And never live but true unto his liege!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Rises</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret and
Somerset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the
queen:<br>
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his
head,<br>
But boldly stand and front him to his face.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">How now! is Somerset at liberty?<br>
Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison&#8217;d thoughts,<br>
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.<br>
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?<br>
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,<br>
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?<br>
King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,<br>
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,<br>
Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.<br>
That head of thine doth not become a crown;<br>
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer&#8217;s staff,<br>
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.<br>
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,<br>
Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles&#8217; spear,<br>
Is able with the change to kill and cure.<br>
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up<br>
And with the same to act controlling laws.<br>
Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more<br>
O&#8217;er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,<br>
Of capital treason &#8217;gainst the king and crown;<br>
Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of
these,<br>
If they can brook I bow a knee to man.<br>
Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">I know, ere they will have me go to ward,<br>
They&#8217;ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,<br>
To say if that the bastard boys of York<br>
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Buckingham</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">O blood-besotted Neapolitan,<br>
Outcast of Naples, England&#8217;s bloody scourge!<br>
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,<br>
Shall be their father&#8217;s bail; and bane to those<br>
That for my surety will refuse the boys!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edward and
Richard</span></p>
<p class="speech">See where they come: I&#8217;ll warrant
they&#8217;ll
make it good.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clifford and Young
Clifford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>

<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Health and all happiness to my lord the king!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with
thee?<br>
Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;<br>
We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;<br>
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">This is my king, York, I do not mistake;<br>
But thou mistakest me much to think I do:<br>
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour<br>
Makes him oppose himself against his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,<br>
And chop away that factious pate of his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">He is arrested, but will not obey;<br>
His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not, sons?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">And if words will not, then our weapons
shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Look in a glass, and call thy image so:<br>
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.<br>
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,<br>
That with the very shaking of their chains<br>
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:<br>
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Warwick and
Salisbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Are these thy bears? we&#8217;ll bait thy bears
to death.<br>
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,<br>
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Oft have I seen a hot o&#8217;erweening cur<br>
Run back and bite, because he was withheld;<br>
Who, being suffer&#8217;d with the bear&#8217;s fell paw,<br>
Hath clapp&#8217;d his tail between his legs and cried:<br>
And such a piece of service will you do,<br>
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,<br>
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Take heed, lest by your heat you burn
yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?<br>
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,<br>
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!<br>
What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,<br>
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?<br>
O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?<br>
If it be banish&#8217;d from the frosty head,<br>
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?<br>
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,<br>
And shame thine honourable age with blood?<br>
Why art thou old, and want&#8217;st experience?<br>
Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?<br>
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me<br>
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I have consider&#8217;d with myself<br>
The title of this most renowned duke;<br>
And in my conscience do repute his grace<br>
The rightful heir to England&#8217;s royal seat.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an
oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">It is great sin to swear unto a sin,<br>
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.<br>
Who can be bound by any solemn vow<br>
To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,<br>
To force a spotless virgin&#8217;s chastity,<br>
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,<br>
To wring the widow from her custom&#8217;d right,<br>
And have no other reason for this wrong<br>
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A subtle traitor needs no sophister.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou
hast,<br>
I am resolved for death or dignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">You were best to go to bed and dream again,<br>
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">I am resolved to bear a greater storm<br>
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;<br>
And that I&#8217;ll write upon thy burgonet,<br>
Might I but know thee by thy household badge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my father&#8217;s badge, old
Nevil&#8217;s crest,<br>
The rampant bear chain&#8217;d to the ragged staff,<br>
This day I&#8217;ll wear aloft my burgonet,<br>
As on a mountain top the cedar shows<br>
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,<br>
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">And from thy burgonet I&#8217;ll rend thy
bear<br>
And tread it under foot with all contempt,<br>
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">And so to arms, victorious father,<br>
To quell the rebels and their complices.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,<br>
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Foul stigmatic, that&#8217;s more than thou canst
tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">If not in heaven, you&#8217;ll surely sup in
hell.</p>

Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.<br>
He that is truly dedicate to war<br>

To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve<br>
The silver livery of advised age,<br>
And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus<br>
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight<br>
My heart is turn&#8217;d to stone: and while &#8217;tis mine,<br>
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;<br>
No more will I their babes: tears virginal<br>
