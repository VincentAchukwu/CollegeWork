<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Warkworth. Before the
castle</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rumour, painted full of
tongues</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rumour</p>
<p class="speech">Open your ears; for which of you will stop<br>
The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?<br>
I, from the orient to the drooping west,<br>
Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold<br>
The acts commenced on this ball of earth:<br>
Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,<br>
The which in every language I pronounce,<br>
Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.<br>
I speak of peace, while covert enmity<br>
Under the smile of safety wounds the world:<br>
And who but Rumour, who but only I,<br>
Make fearful musters and prepared defence,<br>
Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,<br>
Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,<br>
And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe<br>
Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures<br>
And of so easy and so plain a stop<br>
That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,<br>
The still-discordant wavering multitude,<br>
Can play upon it. But what need I thus<br>
My well-known body to anatomize<br>
Among my household? Why is Rumour here?<br>
I run before King Harry&#8217;s victory;<br>
Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury<br>
Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,<br>
Quenching the flame of bold rebellion<br>
Even with the rebel&#8217;s blood. But what mean I<br>
To speak so true at first? my office is<br>
To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell<br>
Under the wrath of noble Hotspur&#8217;s sword,<br>
And that the king before the Douglas&#8217; rage<br>
Stoop&#8217;d his anointed head as low as death.<br>
This have I rumour&#8217;d through the peasant towns<br>
Between that royal field of Shrewsbury<br>
And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,<br>
Where Hotspur&#8217;s father, old Northumberland,<br>
Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,<br>
And not a man of them brings other news<br>
Than they have learn&#8217;d of me: from Rumour&#8217;s tongues<br>
They bring smooth comforts false, worse than<br>
true wrongs.</p>

Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Who keeps the gate here, ho?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Porter opens the
gate</span></p>
<p class="speech">Where is the earl?</p>
<p class="speaker">Porter</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I say you are?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Tell thou the earl<br>
That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Porter</p>
<p class="speech">His lordship is walk&#8217;d forth into the
orchard;<br>
Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,<br>
And he himself wilt answer.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter
Northumberland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the earl.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Porter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now<br>
Should be the father of some stratagem:<br>
The times are wild: contention, like a horse<br>
Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose<br>
And bears down all before him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Noble earl,<br>
I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Good, an God will!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;As good as heart can wish:<br>
The king is almost wounded to the death;<br>
And, in the fortune of my lord your son,<br>
Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts<br>
Kill&#8217;d by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John<br>
And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;<br>
And Harry Monmouth&#8217;s brawn, the hulk Sir John,<br>
Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,<br>
So fought, so follow&#8217;d and so fairly won,<br>
Came not till now to dignify the times,<br>
Since Caesar&#8217;s fortunes!</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">How is this derived?<br>
Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">I spake with one, my lord, that came from
thence,<br>
A gentleman well bred and of good name,<br>
That freely render&#8217;d me these news for true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent<br>
On Tuesday last to listen after news.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Travers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I over-rode him on the way;<br>
And he is furnish&#8217;d with no certainties<br>
More than he haply may retail from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Travers</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn&#8217;d me
back<br>
With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,<br>
Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard<br>
A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,<br>
That stopp&#8217;d by me to breathe his bloodied horse.<br>
He ask&#8217;d the way to Chester; and of him<br>
I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:<br>
He told me that rebellion had bad luck<br>
And that young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold.<br>
With that, he gave his able horse the head,<br>
And bending forward struck his armed heels<br>
Against the panting sides of his poor jade<br>
Up to the rowel-head, and starting so<br>
He seem&#8217;d in running to devour the way,<br>
Staying no longer question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! Again:<br>
Said he young Harry Percy&#8217;s spur was cold?<br>
Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion<br>
Had met ill luck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, I&#8217;ll tell you
what;<br>
If my young lord your son have not the day,<br>
Upon mine honour, for a silken point<br>
I&#8217;ll give my barony: never talk of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Why should that gentleman that rode by
Travers<br>
Give then such instances of loss?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Who, he?<br>
He was some hilding fellow that had stolen<br>
The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,<br>
Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Morton</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, this man&#8217;s brow, like to a
title-leaf,<br>
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:<br>
So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood<br>
Hath left a witness&#8217;d usurpation.<br>
Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;<br>
Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask<br>
To fright our party.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">How doth my son and brother?<br>
Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek<br>
Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.<br>
Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,<br>
So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,<br>
Drew Priam&#8217;s curtain in the dead of night,<br>
And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;<br>
But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,<br>
And I my Percy&#8217;s death ere thou report&#8217;st it.<br>
This thou wouldst say, &#8216;Your son did thus and thus;<br>
Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:&#8217;<br>
Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:<br>
But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,<br>
Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,<br>
Ending with &#8216;Brother, son, and all are dead.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;<br>
But, for my lord your son&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he is dead.<br>
See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!<br>
He that but fears the thing he would not know<br>
Hath by instinct knowledge from others&#8217; eyes<br>
That what he fear&#8217;d is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;<br>
Tell thou an earl his divination lies,<br>
And I will take it as a sweet disgrace<br>
And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">You are too great to be by me gainsaid:<br>
Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Yet, for all this, say not that Percy&#8217;s
dead.<br>
I see a strange confession in thine eye:<br>
Thou shakest thy head and hold&#8217;st it fear or sin<br>
To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;<br>
The tongue offends not that reports his death:<br>
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,<br>
Not he which says the dead is not alive.<br>
Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news<br>
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue<br>
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,<br>
Remember&#8217;d tolling a departing friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry I should force you to believe<br>
That which I would to God I had not seen;<br>
But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,<br>
Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,<br>
To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down<br>
The never-daunted Percy to the earth,<br>
From whence with life he never more sprung up.<br>
In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire<br>
Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,<br>
Being bruited once, took fire and heat away<br>
From the best temper&#8217;d courage in his troops;<br>
For from his metal was his party steel&#8217;d;<br>
Which once in him abated, all the rest<br>
Turn&#8217;d on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:<br>
And as the thing that&#8217;s heavy in itself,<br>
Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,<br>
So did our men, heavy in Hotspur&#8217;s loss,<br>
Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear<br>
That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim<br>
Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,<br>
Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester<br>
Too soon ta&#8217;en prisoner; and that furious Scot,<br>
The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword<br>
Had three times slain the appearance of the king,<br>
&#8217;Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame<br>
Of those that turn&#8217;d their backs, and in his flight,<br>
Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all<br>
Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out<br>
A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,<br>
Under the conduct of young Lancaster<br>
And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">For this I shall have time enough to mourn.<br>
In poison there is physic; and these news,<br>
Having been well, that would have made me sick,<br>
Being sick, have in some measure made me well:<br>
And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken&#8217;d joints,<br>
Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,<br>
Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire<br>
Out of his keeper&#8217;s arms, even so my limbs,<br>
Weaken&#8217;d with grief, being now enraged with grief,<br>
Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!<br>
A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel<br>
Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!<br>
Thou art a guard too wanton for the head<br>
Which princes, flesh&#8217;d with conquest, aim to hit.<br>
Now bind my brows with iron; and approach<br>
The ragged&#8217;st hour that time and spite dare bring<br>
To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!<br>
Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature&#8217;s hand<br>
Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!<br>
And let this world no longer be a stage<br>
To feed contention in a lingering act;<br>
But let one spirit of the first-born Cain<br>
Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set<br>
On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,<br>
And darkness be the burier of the dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Travers</p>
<p class="speech">This strained passion doth you wrong, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your
honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">The lives of all your loving complices<br>
Lean on your health; the which, if you give o&#8217;er<br>
To stormy passion, must perforce decay.<br>
You cast the event of war, my noble lord,<br>
And summ&#8217;d the account of chance, before you said<br>
&#8216;Let us make head.&#8217; It was your presurmise,<br>
That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:<br>
You knew he walk&#8217;d o&#8217;er perils, on an edge,<br>
More likely to fall in than to get o&#8217;er;<br>
You were advised his flesh was capable<br>
Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit<br>
Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:<br>
Yet did you say &#8216;Go forth;&#8217; and none of this,<br>
Though strongly apprehended, could restrain<br>
The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,<br>
Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,<br>
More than that being which was like to be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">We all that are engaged to this loss<br>
Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas<br>
That if we wrought our life &#8217;twas ten to one;<br>
And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed<br>
Choked the respect of likely peril fear&#8217;d;<br>
And since we are o&#8217;erset, venture again.<br>
Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.</p>
<p class="speaker">Morton</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis more than time: and, my most noble
lord,<br>
I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,<br>
The gentle Archbishop of York is up<br>
With well-appointed powers: he is a man<br>
Who with a double surety binds his followers.<br>
My lord your son had only but the corpse,<br>
But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;<br>
For that same word, rebellion, did divide<br>
The action of their bodies from their souls;<br>
And they did fight with queasiness, constrain&#8217;d,<br>
As men drink potions, that their weapons only<br>
Seem&#8217;d on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,<br>
This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,<br>
As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop<br>
Turns insurrection to religion:<br>
Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,<br>
He&#8217;s followed both with body and with mind;<br>
And doth enlarge his rising with the blood<br>
Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;<br>
Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;<br>
Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,<br>
Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;<br>
And more and less do flock to follow him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,<br>
This present grief had wiped it from my mind.<br>
Go in with me; and counsel every man<br>
The aptest way for safety and revenge:<br>
Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:<br>
Never so few, and never yet more need.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff, with his Page
bearing his sword and buckler</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my
water?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">He said, sir, the water itself was a good
healthy
water; but, for the party that owed it, he might
have more diseases than he knew for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me:
the
brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
prince put thee into my service for any other reason
than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
send you back again to your master, for a jewel,&#8212;
the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, &#8217;tis
not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
out of it; and yet he&#8217;ll be crowing as if he had
writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
may keep his own grace, but he&#8217;s almost out of mine,
I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
the satin for my short cloak and my slops?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">He said, sir, you should procure him better
assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
band and yours; he liked not the security.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God
his
tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,
and then stand upon security! The whoreson
smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
through with them in honest taking up, then they
must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
security. I looked a&#8217; should have sent me two and
twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;
for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness
of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
Where&#8217;s Bardolph?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s gone into Smithfield to buy your
worship a horse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I bought him in Paul&#8217;s, and he&#8217;ll buy
me a horse in
Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.</p>

<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed
the<br>
Prince for striking him about Bardolph.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Wait, close; I will not see him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he that goes there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Falstaff, an&#8217;t please your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">He that was in question for the robbery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">He, my lord: but he hath since done good service
at
Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What, to York? Call him back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Boy, tell him I am deaf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">You must speak louder; my master is deaf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing
good.<br>
Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What! a young knave, and begging! Is there
not
wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it
is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
how to make it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake me, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man?
setting
my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied
in my throat, if I had said so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and
our
soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,
you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other
than an honest man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside
that
which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,
hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be
hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my lord would speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My good lord! God give your lordship good time
of
day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
of your health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition
to<br>
Shrewsbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t please your lordship, I hear his
majesty is
returned with some discomfort from Wales.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I talk not of his majesty: you would not come
when<br>
I sent for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen
into
this same whoreson apoplexy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak
with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of
lethargy,
an&#8217;t please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
blood, a whoreson tingling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What tell you me of it? be it as it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">It hath its original from much grief, from study
and
perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I think you are fallen into the disease; for
you
hear not what I say to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an&#8217;t
please
you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
of not marking, that I am troubled withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">To punish you by the heels would amend the
attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
become your physician.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so
patient:
your lordship may minister the potion of
imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
should I be your patient to follow your
prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I sent for you, when there were matters against
you
for your life, to come speak with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">As I was then advised by my learned counsel in
the
laws of this land-service, I did not come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great
infamy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in
less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Your means are very slender, and your waste is
great.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were otherwise; I would my means
were
greater, and my waist slenderer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">You have misled the youthful prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">The young prince hath misled me: I am the
fellow
with the great belly, and he my dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound:
your
day&#8217;s service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
over your night&#8217;s exploit on Gad&#8217;s-hill: you may
thank the unquiet time for your quiet o&#8217;er-posting
that action.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
sleeping wolf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What! you are as a candle, the better part
burnt
out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did
say
of wax, my growth would approve the truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">There is not a white hair on your face but
should
have his effect of gravity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">You follow the young prince up and down, like
his
ill angel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I
hope
he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
costermonger times that true valour is turned
bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
You that are old consider not the capacities of us
that are young; you do measure the heat of our
livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
are wags too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Do you set down your name in the scroll of
youth,
that are written down old with all the characters of
age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I was born about three of the clock in
the
afternoon, with a white head and something a round
belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
and old sack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, God send the prince a better companion!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">God send the companion a better prince! I
cannot
rid my hands of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry:
I
hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
against the Archbishop and the Earl of
Northumberland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But
look
you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
might never spit white again. There is not a
dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
me rest. I would to God my name were not so
terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
nothing with perpetual motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless
your
expedition!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound
to
furnish me forth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient
to
bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my
cousin Westmoreland.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Chief-Justice and
Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A
man
can no more separate age and covetousness than a&#8217;
can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout
galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and
so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What money is in my purse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Seven groats and two pence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I can get no remedy against this consumption of
the
purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,
but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter
to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this
to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry
since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.
About it: you know where to find me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Page</span></p>
<p class="speech">A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox!
for
the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
toe. &#8217;Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars
for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more
reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:
I will turn diseases to commodity.</p>

<h4>Scene III. York. The Archbishop&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Archbishop Of York,
the Lords Hastings, Mowbray, and Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Thus have you heard our cause and known our
means;<br>
And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,<br>
Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:<br>
And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">I well allow the occasion of our arms;<br>
But gladly would be better satisfied<br>
How in our means we should advance ourselves<br>
To look with forehead bold and big enough<br>
Upon the power and puissance of the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Our present musters grow upon the file<br>
To five and twenty thousand men of choice;<br>
And our supplies live largely in the hope<br>
Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns<br>
With an incensed fire of injuries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth
thus;<br>
Whether our present five and twenty thousand<br>
May hold up head without Northumberland?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">With him, we may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yea, marry, there&#8217;s the
point:<br>
But if without him we be thought too feeble,<br>
My judgment is, we should not step too far<br>
Till we had his assistance by the hand;<br>
For in a theme so bloody-faced as this<br>
Conjecture, expectation, and surmise<br>
Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for
indeed<br>
It was young Hotspur&#8217;s case at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,<br>
Eating the air on promise of supply,<br>
Flattering himself in project of a power<br>
Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:<br>
And so, with great imagination<br>
Proper to madmen, led his powers to death<br>
And winking leap&#8217;d into destruction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt<br>
To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, if this present quality of war,<br>
Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot<br>
Lives so in hope as in an early spring<br>
We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,<br>
Hope gives not so much warrant as despair<br>
That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,<br>
We first survey the plot, then draw the model;<br>
And when we see the figure of the house,<br>
Then must we rate the cost of the erection;<br>
Which if we find outweighs ability,<br>
What do we then but draw anew the model<br>
In fewer offices, or at last desist<br>
To build at all? Much more, in this great work,<br>
Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down<br>
And set another up, should we survey<br>
The plot of situation and the model,<br>
Consent upon a sure foundation,<br>
Question surveyors, know our own estate,<br>
How able such a work to undergo,<br>
To weigh against his opposite; or else<br>
We fortify in paper and in figures,<br>
Using the names of men instead of men:<br>
Like one that draws the model of a house<br>
Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,<br>
Gives o&#8217;er and leaves his part-created cost<br>
A naked subject to the weeping clouds<br>
And waste for churlish winter&#8217;s tyranny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair
birth,<br>
Should be still-born, and that we now possess&#8217;d<br>
The utmost man of expectation,<br>
I think we are a body strong enough,<br>
Even as we are, to equal with the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">What, is the king but five and twenty
thousand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord
Bardolph.<br>
For his divisions, as the times do brawl,<br>
Are in three heads: one power against the French,<br>
And one against Glendower; perforce a third<br>
Must take up us: so is the unfirm king<br>
In three divided; and his coffers sound<br>
With hollow poverty and emptiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">That he should draw his several strengths
together<br>
And come against us in full puissance,<br>
Need not be dreaded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">If he should do so,<br>
He leaves his back unarm&#8217;d, the French and Welsh<br>
Baying him at the heels: never fear that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;<br>
Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:<br>
But who is substituted &#8217;gainst the French,<br>
I have no certain notice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Let us on,<br>
And publish the occasion of our arms.<br>
The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;<br>
Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:<br>
An habitation giddy and unsure<br>
Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.<br>
O thou fond many, with what loud applause<br>
Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,<br>
Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!<br>
And being now trimm&#8217;d in thine own desires,<br>
Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,<br>
That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.<br>
So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge<br>
Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;<br>
And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,<br>
And howl&#8217;st to find it. What trust is in these times?<br>
They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,<br>
Are now become enamour&#8217;d on his grave:<br>
Thou, that threw&#8217;st dust upon his goodly head<br>
When through proud London he came sighing on<br>
After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,<br>
Criest now &#8216;O earth, yield us that king again,<br>
And take thou this!&#8217; O thoughts of men accursed!<br>
Past and to come seems best; things present worst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>

thou hemp-seed!</p>

fustilarian! I&#8217;ll tickle your catastrophe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Lord Chief-Justice,
and his men</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand
to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir John! what are you brawling
here?<br>
Doth this become your place, your time and business?<br>
You should have been well on your way to York.<br>
Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang&#8217;st upon him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">O most worshipful lord, an&#8217;t please your
grace, I am
a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">For what sum?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">It is more than for some, my lord; it is for
all,
all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;
he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of
his: but I will have some of it out again, or I
will ride thee o&#8217; nights like the mare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I
have
any vantage of ground to get up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of
good
temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so
rough a course to come by her own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What is the gross sum that I owe thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and
the
money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a
parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,
at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon
Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke
thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of
Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was
washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife
Keech, the butcher&#8217;s wife, come in then and call me
gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of
vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;
whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I
told thee they were ill for a green wound? And
didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,
desire me to be no more so familiarity with such
poor people; saying that ere long they should call
me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me
fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says
up
and down the town that the eldest son is like you:
she hath been in good case, and the truth is,
poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish
officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with
your
manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It
is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
that come with such more than impudent sauciness
from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:
you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the
easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her
serve your uses both in purse and in person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, in truth, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her,
and
unpay the villany you have done her: the one you
may do with sterling money, and the other with
current repentance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I will not undergo this sneap
without
reply. You call honourable boldness impudent
sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say
nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble
duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say
to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,
being upon hasty employment in the king&#8217;s affairs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">You speak as having power to do wrong: but
answer
in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this
poor woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, hostess.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gower</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Master Gower, what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales<br>
Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">As I am a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, you said so before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be
fain
to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my
dining-chambers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for
thy
walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of
the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,
is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these
fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou
canst. Come, an &#8217;twere not for thy humours, there&#8217;s
not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,
and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in
this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I
know thou wast set on to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles:
i&#8217;
faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,
la!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Let it alone; I&#8217;ll make other shift:
you&#8217;ll be a
fool still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown.
I
hope you&#8217;ll come to supper. You&#8217;ll pay me all
together?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Will I live?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at
supper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No more words; let&#8217;s have her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mistress Quickly,
Bardolph, Officers and Boy</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard better news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the news, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Where lay the king last night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">At Basingstoke, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I hope, my lord, all&#8217;s well: what is the
news, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Come all his forces back?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,<br>
Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,<br>
Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Comes the king back from Wales, my noble
lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">You shall have letters of me presently:<br>
Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to
dinner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank
you,
good Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are
to
take soldiers up in counties as you go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Will you sup with me, Master Gower?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir
John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a
fool
that taught them me. This is the right fencing
grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great

<h4>Scene II. London. Another street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince Henry and
Poins</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Before God, I am exceeding weary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t come to that? I had thought weariness
durst not
have attached one of so high blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied
as
to remember so weak a composition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Belike then my appetite was not princely got;
for,
by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
small beer. But, indeed, these humble
considerations make me out of love with my
greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
a great while, because the rest of thy low
countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
midwives say the children are not in the fault;
whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
mightily strengthened.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">How ill it follows, after you have laboured so
hard,
you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
young princes would do so, their fathers being so
sick as yours at this time is?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good
thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding
than thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that
you
will tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should
be
sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
indeed too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Very hardly upon such a subject.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the
devil&#8217;s
book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">The reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou think of me, if I should
weep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">It would be every man&#8217;s thought; and thou
art a
blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
a man&#8217;s thought in the world keeps the road-way
better than thine: every man would think me an
hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
worshipful thought to think so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Why, because you have been so lewd and so
much
engraffed to Falstaff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">And to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear
it
with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bardolph and

<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>

<p class="speech">And yours, most noble Bardolph!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must
you
be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a
maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is&#8217;t such a
matter to get a pottle-pot&#8217;s maidenhead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">A&#8217; calls me e&#8217;en now, my lord,
through a red
lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife&#8217;s
new petticoat and so peeped through.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Has not the boy profited?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Away, you rascally Althaea&#8217;s dream,
away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was
delivered
of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">A crown&#8217;s worth of good interpretation:
there &#8217;tis,
boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">O, that this good blossom could be kept from
cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>

gallows shall have wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">And how doth thy master, Bardolph?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my lord. He heard of your grace&#8217;s
coming to
town: there&#8217;s a letter for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
martlemas, your master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">In bodily health, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, the immortal part needs a physician;
but
that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as

Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent

Threw many a northward look to see his father<br>
Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.<br>
Who then persuaded you to stay at home?<br>
There were two honours lost, yours and your son&#8217;s.<br>
For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!<br>
For his, it stuck upon him as the sun<br>
In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light<br>
Did all the chivalry of England move<br>
To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass<br>
Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:<br>
He had no legs that practised not his gait;<br>
And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,<br>
Became the accents of the valiant;<br>
For those that could speak low and tardily<br>
Would turn their own perfection to abuse,<br>
To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,<br>
In diet, in affections of delight,<br>
In military rules, humours of blood,<br>
He was the mark and glass, copy and book,<br>
That fashion&#8217;d others. And him, O wondrous him!<br>

Second to none, unseconded by you,<br>
To look upon the hideous god of war<br>
In disadvantage; to abide a field<br>
Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur&#8217;s name<br>
Did seem defensible: so you left him.<br>
Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong<br>
To hold your honour more precise and nice<br>
With others than with him! let them alone:<br>
The marshal and the archbishop are strong:<br>
Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,<br>

apple-johns?
thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Drawer</p>
<p class="speech">Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a
dish
of apple-johns before him, and told him there were
five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said
&#8216;I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,
old, withered knights.&#8217; It angered him to the
heart: but he hath forgot that.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Drawer</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see
if
thou canst find out Sneak&#8217;s noise; Mistress
Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the

straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Drawer</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master
Poins
anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and

extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your
colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good
truth, la! But, i&#8217; faith, you have drunk too much
canaries; and that&#8217;s a marvellous searching wine,

yourself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two

i&#8217; good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you
cannot one bear with another&#8217;s confirmities. What
the good-year! one must bear, and that must be
you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the
emptier vessel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doll Tearsheet</p>
<p class="speech">Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
hogshead? there&#8217;s a whole merchant&#8217;s venture of
Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk
better stuffed in the hold. Come, I&#8217;ll be friends

<p class="speech">Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come
hither: it is the foul-mouthed&#8217;st rogue in England.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by
my
faith; I must live among my neighbours: I&#8217;ll no
swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the
very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers
here: I have not lived all this while, to have
swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne&#8217;er tell me: your
ancient
swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master
Tisick, the debuty, t&#8217;other day; and, as he said to
me, &#8217;twas no longer ago than Wednesday last,
&#8216;I&#8217;
good faith, neighbour Quickly,&#8217; says he; Master
Dumbe, our minister, was by then; &#8216;neighbour
Quickly,&#8217; says he, &#8216;receive those that are civil;
for,&#8217; said he, &#8216;you are in an ill name:&#8217; now
a&#8217;
said so, I can tell whereupon; &#8216;for,&#8217; says he,
&#8216;you
are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore
take heed what guests you receive: receive,&#8217; says
he, &#8216;no swaggering companions.&#8217; There comes none
here: you would bless you to hear what he said:
no, I&#8217;ll no swaggerers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater,
i&#8217;
faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy
greyhound: he&#8217;ll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if
her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
Call him up, drawer.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man

I warrant you.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>

<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off
here:
discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet
captain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doll Tearsheet</p>
<p class="speech">Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art
thou
not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were
of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for
taking their names upon you before you have earned
them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for
tearing a poor whore&#8217;s ruff in a bawdy-house? He a
captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy
stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God&#8217;s
light, these villains will make the word as odious
as the word &#8216;occupy;&#8217; which was an excellent good

had need look to &#8217;t.</p>

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A good shallow young fellow: a&#8217; would have

well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doll Tearsheet</p>

than is in a mallet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doll Tearsheet</p>
<p class="speech">Why does the prince love him so, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Because their legs are both of a bigness, and
a&#8217;
plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
and drinks off candles&#8217; ends for flap-dragons, and
rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon
joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and
wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of
the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet
stories; and such other gambol faculties a&#8217; has,
that show a weak mind and an able body, for the
which the prince admits him: for the prince himself
is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the
scales between their avoirdupois.</p>

<p class="speech">No abuse, Hal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">No abuse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No abuse, Ned, i&#8217; the world; honest Ned,
none. I
dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked
might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I
have done the part of a careful friend and a true
subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.
No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice
doth
not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to

hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph

<p class="speech">No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit

for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,
contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.</p>

<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech">The king your father is at Westminster:<br>
And there are twenty weak and wearied posts<br>
Come from the north: and, as I came along,<br>
I met and overtook a dozen captains,<br>
Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,<br>
And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,<br>
So idly to profane the precious time,<br>
When tempest of commotion, like the south<br>
Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt<br>

Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.</p>

And steep my senses in forgetfulness?<br>
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,<br>
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee<br>
And hush&#8217;d with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,<br>
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,<br>
Under the canopies of costly state,<br>

O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile<br>
In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch<br>
A watch-case or a common &#8216;larum-bell?<br>
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast<br>
Seal up the ship-boy&#8217;s eyes, and rock his brains<br>
In cradle of the rude imperious surge<br>
And in the visitation of the winds,<br>
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,<br>
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them<br>
With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,<br>
That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?<br>
Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose<br>
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,<br>
And in the calmest and most stillest night,<br>
With all appliances and means to boot,<br>
Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!<br>

<p class="speech">We have, my liege.</p>

My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">O God! that one might read the book of fate,<br>
And see the revolution of the times<br>
Make mountains level, and the continent,<br>
Weary of solid firmness, melt itself<br>
Into the sea! and, other times, to see<br>
The beachy girdle of the ocean<br>
Too wide for Neptune&#8217;s hips; how chances mock,<br>
And changes fill the cup of alteration<br>
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,<br>
The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,<br>
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,<br>
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.<br>
&#8217;Tis not &#8216;ten years gone<br>
Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,<br>
Did feast together, and in two years after<br>
Were they at wars: it is but eight years since<br>
This Percy was the man nearest my soul,<br>
Who like a brother toil&#8217;d in my affairs<br>
And laid his love and life under my foot,<br>
Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard<br>
Gave him defiance. But which of you was by&#8212;<br>
You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember&#8212;</p>

<p class="speech">When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,<br>

&#8216;Northumberland, thou ladder by the which<br>
My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;&#8217;<br>
Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,<br>
But that necessity so bow&#8217;d the state<br>

&#8216;The time shall come,&#8217; thus did he follow it,<br>
&#8216;The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,<br>

The which observed, a man may prophesy,<br>
With a near aim, of the main chance of things<br>
As yet not come to life, which in their seeds<br>
And weak beginnings lie intreasured.<br>
Such things become the hatch and brood of time;<br>
And by the necessary form of this<br>
King Richard might create a perfect guess<br>
That great Northumberland, then false to him,<br>
Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;<br>
Which should not find a ground to root upon,<br>
Unless on you.</p>

To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,<br>
The powers that you already have sent forth<br>
Shall bring this prize in very easily.<br>
To comfort you the more, I have received<br>
A certain instance that Glendower is dead.<br>
Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,<br>

sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by

<p class="speech">Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>

<p class="speaker">Silence</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, sir, to my cost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">A&#8217; must, then, to the inns o&#8217; court
shortly. I was
once of Clement&#8217;s Inn, where I think they will
talk of mad Shallow yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silence</p>
<p class="speech">You were called &#8216;lusty Shallow&#8217; then,
cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">By the mass, I was called any thing; and I
would
have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.
There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,
and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and
Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such
swinge-bucklers in all the inns o&#8217; court again: and
I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were
and had the best of them all at commandment. Then
was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to
Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silence</p>
<p class="speech">This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon
about soldiers?</p>

<p class="speech">The same Sir John, the very same. I see him
break
Skogan&#8217;s head at the court-gate, when a&#8217; was a
crack not thus high: and the very same day did I
fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,
behind Gray&#8217;s Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I
have spent! and to see how many of my old
acquaintance are dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silence</p>
<p class="speech">We shall all follow, cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shadow</p>
<p class="speech">Certain, &#8217;tis certain; very sure, very

<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Jesu, Jesu, dead! a&#8217; drew a good bow; and
dead! a&#8217;
shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and
betted much money on his head. Dead! a&#8217; would have
clapped i&#8217; the clout at twelve score; and carried
you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a
half, that it would have done a man&#8217;s heart good to

<p class="speech">I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of
this
county, and one of the king&#8217;s justices of th e peace:
What is your good pleasure with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>

captain,
Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and
a most gallant leader.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good
backsword
man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my
lady his wife doth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated
than
with a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well
said
indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever
were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of
&#8216;accommodo&#8217; very good; a good phrase.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase
call
you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;
but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a
soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good
command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a
man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,
being, whereby a&#8217; may be thought to be accommodated;
which is an excellent thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">It is very just.</p>

good
hand, give me your worship&#8217;s good hand: by my

welcome, good Sir John.</p>

<p class="speech">I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert<br>
Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?</p>

<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i&#8217; faith!
Things that

well said, Sir John, very well said.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mouldy</p>
<p class="speech">I was pricked well enough before, an you could
have
let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for
one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need
not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter
to go out than I.</p>

Simon Shadow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under:
he&#8217;s like

<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Shadow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shadow</p>
<p class="speech">Here, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Shadow, whose son art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shadow</p>
<p class="speech">My mother&#8217;s son, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Thy mother&#8217;s son! like enough, and thy
father&#8217;s
shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of
the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the
father&#8217;s substance!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Do you like him, Sir John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we

<p class="speaker">Wart</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a very ragged wart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I prick him down, Sir John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">It were superfluous; for his apparel is built
upon
his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:
prick him no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it:
I
commend you well. Francis Feeble!</p>
<p class="speaker">Feeble</p>
<p class="speech">Here, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What trade art thou, Feeble?</p>
<p class="speaker">Feeble</p>
<p class="speech">A woman&#8217;s tailor, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I prick him, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You may: but if he had been a man&#8217;s tailor,
he&#8217;ld
ha&#8217; pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in
an enemy&#8217;s battle as thou hast done in a woman&#8217;s
petticoat?</p>
<p class="speaker">Feeble</p>
<p class="speech">I will do my good will, sir; you can have no
more.</p>

said,
courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the
wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the

Shallow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Feeble</p>
<p class="speech">I would Wart might have gone, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would thou wert a man&#8217;s tailor, that thou
mightst
mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him
to a private soldier that is the leader of so many
thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Feeble</p>
<p class="speech">It shall suffice, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is
next?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Peter Bullcalf o&#8217; the green!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, marry, let&#8217;s see Bullcalf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bullcalf</p>
<p class="speech">Here, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me
Bullcalf

<p class="speaker">Bullcalf</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord! good my lord captain,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bullcalf</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What disease hast thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bullcalf</p>
<p class="speech">A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I
caught
with ringing in the king&#8217;s affairs upon his
coronation-day, sir.</p>

<p class="speech">Ha! &#8217;twas a merry night. And is Jane
Nightwork alive?</p>

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose
a
man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the
spirit, Master Shallow. Here&#8217;s Wart; you see what a
ragged appearance it is; a&#8217; shall charge you and
discharge you with the motion of a pewterer&#8217;s
hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
on the brewer&#8217;s bucket. And this same half-faced
fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
how swiftly will this Feeble the woman&#8217;s tailor run
off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart&#8217;s hand, Bardolph.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well:
go
to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i&#8217;
faith, Wart; thou&#8217;rt a good scab: hold, there&#8217;s a
tester for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">He is not his craft&#8217;s master; he doth not

right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
Clement&#8217;s Inn&#8212;I was then Sir Dagonet in
Arthur&#8217;s
show,&#8212;there was a little quiver fellow, and a&#8217;
would manage you his piece thus; and a&#8217; would about

tah, tah,&#8217; would a&#8217; say; &#8216;bounce&#8217; would

away again would a&#8217; go, and again would a&#8217; come: I

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">These fellows will do well, Master Shallow.
God

<p class="speech">As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I
do
see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how
subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he
hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk&#8217;s
tribute. I do remember him at Clement&#8217;s Inn like a
man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a&#8217;
was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
with a knife: a&#8217; was so forlorn, that his
dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a&#8217;
was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a&#8217; came
ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
his good-nights. And now is this Vice&#8217;s dagger
become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
I&#8217;ll be sworn a&#8217; ne&#8217;er saw him but once in
the
Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
among the marshal&#8217;s men. I saw it, and told John a
Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I&#8217;ll
be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
go hard but I will make him a philosopher&#8217;s two
stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.</p>

The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:<br>
What doth concern your coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Then, my lord,<br>
Unto your grace do I in chief address<br>
The substance of my speech. If that rebellion<br>
Came like itself, in base and abject routs,<br>
Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,<br>
And countenanced by boys and beggary,<br>
I say, if damn&#8217;d commotion so appear&#8217;d,<br>
In his true, native and most proper shape,<br>
You, reverend father, and these noble lords<br>
Had not been here, to dress the ugly form<br>
Of base and bloody insurrection<br>
With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,<br>
Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,<br>
Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch&#8217;d,<br>
Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor&#8217;d,<br>
Whose white investments figure innocence,<br>
The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,<br>
Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself<br>
Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,<br>
Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;<br>
Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,<br>
Your pens to lances and your tongue divine<br>
To a trumpet and a point of war?</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.<br>
Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,<br>
And with our surfeiting and wanton hours<br>
Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,<br>
And we must bleed for it; of which disease<br>
Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.<br>
But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,<br>
I take not on me here as a physician,<br>
Nor do I as an enemy to peace<br>
Troop in the throngs of military men;<br>
But rather show awhile like fearful war,<br>
To diet rank minds sick of happiness<br>
And purge the obstructions which begin to stop<br>
Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.<br>
I have in equal balance justly weigh&#8217;d<br>
What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,<br>
And find our griefs heavier than our offences.<br>
We see which way the stream of time doth run,<br>
And are enforced from our most quiet there<br>
By the rough torrent of occasion;<br>
And have the summary of all our griefs,<br>
When time shall serve, to show in articles;<br>
Which long ere this we offer&#8217;d to the king,<br>
And might by no suit gain our audience:<br>
When we are wrong&#8217;d and would unfold our griefs,<br>
We are denied access unto his person<br>
Even by those men that most have done us wrong.<br>
The dangers of the days but newly gone,<br>
Whose memory is written on the earth<br>
With yet appearing blood, and the examples<br>
Of every minute&#8217;s instance, present now,<br>
Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,<br>
Not to break peace or any branch of it,<br>
But to establish here a peace indeed,<br>
Concurring both in name and quality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">When ever yet was your appeal denied?<br>
Wherein have you been galled by the king?<br>
What peer hath been suborn&#8217;d to grate on you,<br>
That you should seal this lawless bloody book<br>
Of forged rebellion with a seal divine<br>
And consecrate commotion&#8217;s bitter edge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">My brother general, the commonwealth,<br>
To brother born an household cruelty,<br>
I make my quarrel in particular.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">There is no need of any such redress;<br>
Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Why not to him in part, and to us all<br>
That feel the bruises of the days before,<br>
And suffer the condition of these times<br>
To lay a heavy and unequal hand<br>
Upon our honours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, my good Lord Mowbray,<br>
Construe the times to their necessities,<br>
And you shall say indeed, it is the time,<br>
And not the king, that doth you injuries.<br>
Yet for your part, it not appears to me<br>
Either from the king or in the present time<br>
That you should have an inch of any ground<br>
To build a grief on: were you not restored<br>
To all the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s signories,<br>
Your noble and right well remember&#8217;d father&#8217;s?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">What thing, in honour, had my father lost,<br>
That need to be revived and breathed in me?<br>
The king that loved him, as the state stood then,<br>
Was force perforce compell&#8217;d to banish him:<br>
And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,<br>
Being mounted and both roused in their seats,<br>
Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,<br>
Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,<br>
Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel<br>
And the loud trumpet blowing them together,<br>
Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay&#8217;d<br>
My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,<br>
O when the king did throw his warder down,<br>
His own life hung upon the staff he threw;<br>
Then threw he down himself and all their lives<br>
That by indictment and by dint of sword<br>
Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not
what.<br>
The Earl of Hereford was reputed then<br>
In England the most valiant gentlemen:<br>
Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?<br>
But if your father had been victor there,<br>
He ne&#8217;er had borne it out of Coventry:<br>
For all the country in a general voice<br>
Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love<br>
Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on<br>
And bless&#8217;d and graced indeed, more than the king.<br>
But this is mere digression from my purpose.<br>
Here come I from our princely general<br>
To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace<br>
That he will give you audience; and wherein<br>
It shall appear that your demands are just,<br>
You shall enjoy them, every thing set off<br>
That might so much as think you enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">But he hath forced us to compel this offer;<br>
And it proceeds from policy, not love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Mowbray, you overween to take it so;<br>
This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:<br>
For, lo! within a ken our army lies,<br>
Upon mine honour, all too confident<br>
To give admittance to a thought of fear.<br>
Our battle is more full of names than yours,<br>
Our men more perfect in the use of arms,<br>
Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;<br>
Then reason will our heart should be as good<br>
Say you not then our offer is compell&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">That argues but the shame of your offence:<br>
A rotten case abides no handling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Hath the Prince John a full commission,<br>
In very ample virtue of his father,<br>
To hear and absolutely to determine<br>
Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">That is intended in the general&#8217;s name:<br>
I muse you make so slight a question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this
schedule,<br>
For this contains our general grievances:<br>
Each several article herein redress&#8217;d,<br>
All members of our cause, both here and hence,<br>
That are insinew&#8217;d to this action,<br>
Acquitted by a true substantial form<br>
And present execution of our wills<br>
To us and to our purposes confined,<br>
We come within our awful banks again<br>
And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">This will I show the general. Please you,
lords,<br>
In sight of both our battles we may meet;<br>
And either end in peace, which God so frame!<br>
Or to the place of difference call the swords<br>
Which must decide it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we will do so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Westmoreland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">There is a thing within my bosom tells me<br>
That no conditions of our peace can stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Fear you not that: if we can make our peace<br>
Upon such large terms and so absolute<br>
As our conditions shall consist upon,<br>
Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but our valuation shall be such<br>
That every slight and false-derived cause,<br>
Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason<br>
Shall to the king taste of this action;<br>
That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,<br>
We shall be winnow&#8217;d with so rough a wind<br>
That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff<br>
And good from bad find no partition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary<br>
Of dainty and such picking grievances:<br>
For he hath found to end one doubt by death<br>
Revives two greater in the heirs of life,<br>
And therefore will he wipe his tables clean<br>
And keep no tell-tale to his memory<br>
That may repeat and history his loss<br>
To new remembrance; for full well he knows<br>
He cannot so precisely weed this land<br>
As his misdoubts present occasion:<br>
His foes are so enrooted with his friends<br>
That, plucking to unfix an enemy,<br>
He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:<br>
So that this land, like an offensive wife<br>
That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,<br>
As he is striking, holds his infant up<br>
And hangs resolved correction in the arm<br>
That was uprear&#8217;d to execution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods<br>
On late offenders, that he now doth lack<br>
The very instruments of chastisement:<br>
So that his power, like to a fangless lion,<br>
May offer, but not hold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true:<br>
And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,<br>
If we do now make our atonement well,<br>
Our peace will, like a broken limb united,<br>
Grow stronger for the breaking.</p>

But you misuse the reverence of your place,<br>
Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,<br>
As a false favourite doth his prince&#8217;s name,<br>
In deeds dishonourable? You have ta&#8217;en up,<br>
Under the counterfeited zeal of God,<br>
The subjects of his substitute, my father,<br>
And both against the peace of heaven and him<br>
Have here up-swarm&#8217;d them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Good my Lord of Lancaster,<br>
I am not here against your father&#8217;s peace;<br>
But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,<br>
The time misorder&#8217;d doth, in common sense,<br>
Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,<br>
To hold our safety up. I sent your grace<br>
The parcels and particulars of our grief,<br>
The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,<br>
Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;<br>
Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm&#8217;d asleep<br>
With grant of our most just and right desires,<br>
And true obedience, of this madness cured,<br>
Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.</p>

Whiles England shall have generation.</p>

How far forth you do like their articles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">I like them all, and do allow them well,<br>
And swear here, by the honour of my blood,<br>
My father&#8217;s purposes have been mistook,<br>
And some about him have too lavishly<br>
Wrested his meaning and authority.<br>
My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress&#8217;d;<br>
Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,<br>
Discharge your powers unto their several counties,<br>
As we will ours: and here between the armies<br>
Let&#8217;s drink together friendly and embrace,<br>

Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses<br>
East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,<br>
Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which<br>
I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:<br>
And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,<br>
Of capitol treason I attach you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Is this proceeding just and honourable?</p>

<p class="speech">Will you thus break your faith?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">I pawn&#8217;d thee none:<br>
I promised you redress of these same grievances<br>
Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,<br>
I will perform with a most Christian care.<br>
But for you, rebels, look to taste the due<br>
Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.<br>
Most shallowly did you these arms commence,<br>
Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.<br>
Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter&#8217;d stray:<br>
God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.<br>
Some guard these traitors to the block of death,<br>

and of what place, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Colevile</p>
<p class="speech">I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is
your

still your name, a traitor your degree, and the

you be still Colevile of the dale.</p>

sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they
weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
trembling, and do observance to my mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Colevile</p>

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I have a whole school of tongues in this belly

in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.
Here comes our general.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince John Of

These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,<br>
One time or other break some gallows&#8217; back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus:
I
never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a
bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the
expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,
travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and
immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I
may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,
&#8216;I came, saw, and overcame.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">It was more of his courtesy than your
deserving.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I know not: here he is, and here I yield him:
and
I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the
rest of this day&#8217;s deeds; or, by the Lord, I will
have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own
picture on the top on&#8217;t, Colevile kissing my foot:
to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not
all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the
clear sky of fame o&#8217;ershine you as much as the full
moon doth the cinders of the element, which show
like pins&#8217; heads to her, believe not the word of
the noble: therefore let me have right, and let
desert mount.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>

me
good, and call it what you will.</p>

<p class="speaker">Colevile</p>
<p class="speech">It is, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And a famous true subject took him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Colevile</p>
<p class="speech">I am, my lord, but as my betters are<br>
That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,<br>
You should have won them dearer than you have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,<br>
And we with sober speed will follow you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,<br>
Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.</p>

Shall better speak of you than you deserve.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would you had but the wit: &#8217;twere better
than
your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
him laugh; but that&#8217;s no marvel, he drinks no wine.
There&#8217;s never none of these demure boys come to any
proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
delectable shapes, which, delivered o&#8217;er to the
voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
excellent wit. The second property of your
excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
which, before cold and settled, left the liver
white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
would teach them should be, to forswear thin
potations and to addict themselves to sack.</p>

How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?<br>
He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;<br>
Thou hast a better place in his affection<br>
Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,<br>
And noble offices thou mayst effect<br>
Of mediation, after I am dead,<br>
Between his greatness and thy other brethren:<br>
Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,<br>
Nor lose the good advantage of his grace<br>
By seeming cold or careless of his will;<br>
For he is gracious, if he be observed:<br>
He hath a tear for pity and a hand<br>
Open as day for melting charity:<br>
Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he&#8217;s flint,<br>
As humorous as winter and as sudden<br>
As flaws congealed in the spring of day.<br>
His temper, therefore, must be well observed:<br>
Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,<br>
When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;<br>
But, being moody, give him line and scope,<br>
Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,<br>
Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,<br>
And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,<br>
A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,<br>
That the united vessel of their blood,<br>
Mingled with venom of suggestion&#8212;<br>
As, force perforce, the age will pour it in&#8212;<br>
Shall never leak, though it do work as strong<br>

Is overspread with them: therefore my grief<br>
Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:<br>
The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape<br>
In forms imaginary the unguided days<br>
And rotten times that you shall look upon<br>
When I am sleeping with my ancestors.<br>
For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,<br>
When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,<br>
When means and lavish manners meet together,<br>
O, with what wings shall his affections fly<br>
Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!</p>

Be look&#8217;d upon and learn&#8217;d; which once

Your highness knows, comes to no further use<br>
But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,<br>
The prince will in the perfectness of time<br>
Cast off his followers; and their memory<br>

And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,<br>

Being so troublesome a bedfellow?<br>
O polish&#8217;d perturbation! golden care!<br>
That keep&#8217;st the ports of slumber open wide<br>
To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!<br>
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet<br>
As he whose brow with homely biggen bound<br>
Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!<br>
When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit<br>
Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,<br>
That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath<br>
There lies a downy feather which stirs not:<br>
Did he suspire, that light and weightless down<br>
Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!<br>
This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep<br>
That from this golden rigol hath divorced<br>
So many English kings. Thy due from me<br>
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,<br>
Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,<br>
Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:<br>
My due from thee is this imperial crown,<br>
Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,<br>
Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,<br>
Which God shall guard: and put the world&#8217;s whole strength<br>
Into one giant arm, it shall not force<br>
This lineal honour from me: this from thee<br>
Will I to mine leave, as &#8217;tis left to me.</p>

My sleep my death?<br>
Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speech">This part of his conjoins with my disease,<br>
And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!<br>
How quickly nature falls into revolt<br>
When gold becomes her object!<br>
For this the foolish over-careful fathers<br>
Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,<br>
Their bones with industry;<br>
For this they have engrossed and piled up<br>
The canker&#8217;d heaps of strange-achieved gold;<br>
For this they have been thoughtful to invest<br>
Their sons with arts and martial exercises:<br>
When, like the bee, culling from every flower<br>
The virtuous sweets,<br>
Our thighs pack&#8217;d with wax, our mouths with honey,<br>
We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,<br>
Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste<br>
Yield his engrossments to the ending father.</p>

Till his friend sickness hath determined me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>

Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,<br>
With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow<br>
That tyranny, which never quaff&#8217;d but blood,<br>
Would, by beholding him, have wash&#8217;d his knife<br>
With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.</p>

<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I never thought to hear you speak again.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:<br>
I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.<br>
Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair<br>
That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours<br>
Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!<br>
Thou seek&#8217;st the greatness that will o&#8217;erwhelm
thee.<br>
Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity<br>
Is held from falling with so weak a wind<br>
That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.<br>
Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours<br>
Were thine without offence; and at my death<br>
Thou hast seal&#8217;d up my expectation:<br>
Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,<br>
And thou wilt have me die assured of it.<br>
Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,<br>
Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,<br>
To stab at half an hour of my life.<br>
What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?<br>
Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,<br>
And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear<br>
That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.<br>
Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse<br>
Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:<br>
Only compound me with forgotten dust<br>
Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.<br>
Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;<br>
For now a time is come to mock at form:<br>
Harry the Fifth is crown&#8217;d: up, vanity!<br>
Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!<br>
And to the English court assemble now,<br>
From every region, apes of idleness!<br>
Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:<br>
Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,<br>
Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit<br>
The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?<br>
Be happy, he will trouble you no more;<br>
England shall double gild his treble guilt,<br>
England shall give him office, honour, might;<br>
For the fifth Harry from curb&#8217;d licence plucks<br>
The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog<br>
Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.<br>
O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!<br>
When that my care could not withhold thy riots,<br>
What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?<br>
O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,<br>
Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,<br>
The moist impediments unto my speech,<br>
I had forestall&#8217;d this dear and deep rebuke<br>
Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard<br>
The course of it so far. There is your crown;<br>
And He that wears the crown immortally<br>
Long guard it yours! If I affect it more<br>
Than as your honour and as your renown,<br>
Let me no more from this obedience rise,<br>
Which my most inward true and duteous spirit<br>
Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.<br>
God witness with me, when I here came in,<br>
And found no course of breath within your majesty,<br>
How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,<br>
O, let me in my present wildness die<br>
And never live to show the incredulous world<br>
The noble change that I have purposed!<br>
Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,<br>
And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,<br>
I spake unto this crown as having sense,<br>
And thus upbraided it: &#8216;The care on thee depending<br>
Hath fed upon the body of my father;<br>
Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:<br>
Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,<br>
Preserving life in medicine potable;<br>
But thou, most fine, most honour&#8217;d: most renown&#8217;d,<br>
Hast eat thy bearer up.&#8217; Thus, my most royal liege,<br>
Accusing it, I put it on my head,<br>
To try with it, as with an enemy<br>
That had before my face murder&#8217;d my father,<br>
The quarrel of a true inheritor.<br>
But if it did infect my blood with joy,<br>
Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;<br>
If any rebel or vain spirit of mine<br>
Did with the least affection of a welcome<br>
Give entertainment to the might of it,<br>
Let God for ever keep it from my head<br>
And make me as the poorest vassal is<br>
That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">O my son,<br>
God put it in thy mind to take it hence,<br>
That thou mightst win the more thy father&#8217;s love,<br>
Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!<br>
Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;<br>
And hear, I think, the very latest counsel<br>
That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,<br>
By what by-paths and indirect crook&#8217;d ways<br>
I met this crown; and I myself know well<br>
How troublesome it sat upon my head.<br>
To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,<br>
Better opinion, better confirmation;<br>
For all the soil of the achievement goes<br>
With me into the earth. It seem&#8217;d in me<br>
But as an honour snatch&#8217;d with boisterous hand,<br>
And I had many living to upbraid<br>
My gain of it by their assistances;<br>
Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,<br>
Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears<br>
Thou see&#8217;st with peril I have answered;<br>
For all my reign hath been but as a scene<br>
Acting that argument: and now my death<br>
Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,<br>
Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;<br>
So thou the garland wear&#8217;st successively.<br>
Yet, though thou stand&#8217;st more sure than I could do,<br>
Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;<br>
And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,<br>
Have but their stings and teeth newly ta&#8217;en out;<br>
By whose fell working I was first advanced<br>
And by whose power I well might lodge a fear<br>
To be again displaced: which to avoid,<br>
I cut them off; and had a purpose now<br>
To lead out many to the Holy Land,<br>
Lest rest and lying still might make them look<br>
Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,<br>
Be it thy course to busy giddy minds<br>
With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,<br>
May waste the memory of the former days.<br>
More would I, but my lungs are wasted so<br>
That strength of speech is utterly denied me.<br>
How I came by the crown, O God forgive;<br>
And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious liege,<br>
You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;<br>
Then plain and right must my possession be:<br>
Which I with more than with a common pain<br>
&#8217;Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.</p>

From this bare wither&#8217;d trunk: upon thy sight<br>

It hath been prophesied to me many years,<br>

me
see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,
bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be
served:
and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?</p>

<p class="speech">With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook:
are
there no young pigeons?</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir. Here is now the smith&#8217;s note for
shoeing

<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>

be excused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need
be

wages, about the sack he lost the other day at
Hinckley fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">A&#8217; shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a
couple
of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any
pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i&#8217;
the
court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men
well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for
they
have marvellous foul linen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Well conceited, Davy: about thy business,
Davy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor
of<br>
Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">There is many complaints, Davy, against that
Visor:
that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Davy</p>
<p class="speech">I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir;
but
yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some
countenance at his friend&#8217;s request. An honest
man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave
is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,
this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I
have but a very little credit with your worship. The
knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I
beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.</p>

<p class="speech">If I were sawed into quantities, I should make
four
dozen of such bearded hermits&#8217; staves as Master
Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
semblable coherence of his men&#8217;s spirits and his:
they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like
foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is
turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
spirits are so married in conjunction with the
participation of society that they flock together in
consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit
to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the
imputation of being near their master: if to his
men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man
could better command his servants. It is certain
that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
caught, as men take diseases, one of another:
therefore let men take heed of their company. I
will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two
actions, and a&#8217; shall laugh without intervallums. O,
it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him
laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!</p>

How might a prince of my great hopes forget<br>
So great indignities you laid upon me?<br>
What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison<br>
The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?<br>
May this be wash&#8217;d in Lethe, and forgotten?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I then did use the person of your father;<br>
The image of his power lay then in me:<br>
And, in the administration of his law,<br>
Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,<br>
Your highness pleased to forget my place,<br>
The majesty and power of law and justice,<br>
The image of the king whom I presented,<br>
And struck me in my very seat of judgment;<br>
Whereon, as an offender to your father,<br>
I gave bold way to my authority<br>
And did commit you. If the deed were ill,<br>
Be you contented, wearing now the garland,<br>
To have a son set your decrees at nought,<br>
To pluck down justice from your awful bench,<br>
To trip the course of law and blunt the sword<br>
That guards the peace and safety of your person;<br>
Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image<br>
And mock your workings in a second body.<br>
Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;<br>
Be now the father and propose a son,<br>
Hear your own dignity so much profaned,<br>
See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,<br>
Behold yourself so by a son disdain&#8217;d;<br>
And then imagine me taking your part<br>
And in your power soft silencing your son:<br>
After this cold considerance, sentence me;<br>
And, as you are a king, speak in your state<br>
What I have done that misbecame my place,<br>
My person, or my liege&#8217;s sovereignty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">You are right, justice, and you weigh this
well;<br>
Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:<br>
And I do wish your honours may increase,<br>
Till you do live to see a son of mine<br>
Offend you and obey you, as I did.<br>
So shall I live to speak my father&#8217;s words:<br>
&#8216;Happy am I, that have a man so bold,<br>
That dares do justice on my proper son;<br>
And not less happy, having such a son,<br>
That would deliver up his greatness so<br>
Into the hands of justice.&#8217; You did commit me:<br>
For which, I do commit into your hand<br>
The unstained sword that you have used to bear;<br>
With this remembrance, that you use the same<br>
With the like bold, just and impartial spirit<br>
As you have done &#8217;gainst me. There is my hand.<br>
You shall be as a father to my youth:<br>
My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,<br>
And I will stoop and humble my intents<br>
To your well-practised wise directions.<br>
And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;<br>
My father is gone wild into his grave,<br>
For in his tomb lie my affections;<br>
And with his spirit sadly I survive,<br>
To mock the expectation of the world,<br>
To frustrate prophecies and to raze out<br>
Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down<br>
After my seeming. The tide of blood in me<br>
Hath proudly flow&#8217;d in vanity till now:<br>
Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,<br>
Where it shall mingle with the state of floods<br>
And flow henceforth in formal majesty.<br>
Now call we our high court of parliament:<br>
And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,<br>
That the great body of our state may go<br>
In equal rank with the best govern&#8217;d nation;<br>
That war, or peace, or both at once, may be<br>
As things acquainted and familiar to us;<br>
In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.<br>
Our coronation done, we will accite,<br>
As I before remember&#8217;d, all our state:<br>
And, God consigning to my good intents,<br>
No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,<br>
God shorten Harry&#8217;s happy life one day!</p>

<h3>EPILOGUE</h3>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Spoken by a Dancer</span></p>
<p class="speech">First my fear; then my courtesy; last my
speech.
My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
patience for it and to promise you a better. I
meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
I would be and here I commit my body to your
mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
was never seen before in such an assembly.
One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
unless already a&#8217; be killed with your hard
opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</p>
