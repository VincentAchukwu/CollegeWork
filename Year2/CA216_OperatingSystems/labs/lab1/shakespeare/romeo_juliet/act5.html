<h4>Scene I. Mantua. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,<br>
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:<br>
My bosom&#8217;s lord sits lightly in his throne;<br>
And all this day an unaccustom&#8217;d spirit<br>
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.<br>
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead&#8212;<br>
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!&#8212;<br>
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,<br>
That I revived, and was an emperor.<br>
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess&#8217;d,<br>
When but love&#8217;s shadows are so rich in joy!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Balthasar,
booted</span></p>
<p class="speech">News from Verona!&#8212;How now, Balthasar!<br>
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?<br>
How doth my lady? Is my father well?<br>
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;<br>
For nothing can be ill, if she be well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:<br>
Her body sleeps in Capel&#8217;s monument,<br>
And her immortal part with angels lives.<br>
I saw her laid low in her kindred&#8217;s vault,<br>
And presently took post to tell it you:<br>
O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,<br>
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!<br>
Thou know&#8217;st my lodging: get me ink and paper,<br>
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you, sir, have patience:<br>
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import<br>
Some misadventure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Tush, thou art deceived:<br>
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.<br>
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No matter: get thee gone,<br>
And hire those horses; I&#8217;ll be with thee straight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Balthasar</span></p>
<p class="speech">Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.<br>
Let&#8217;s see for means: O mischief, thou art swift<br>
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!<br>
I do remember an apothecary,&#8212;<br>
And hereabouts he dwells,&#8212;which late I noted<br>
In tatter&#8217;d weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br>
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,<br>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:<br>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br>
An alligator stuff&#8217;d, and other skins<br>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<br>
A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br>
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,<br>
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,<br>
Were thinly scatter&#8217;d, to make up a show.<br>
Noting this penury, to myself I said<br>
&#8216;An if a man did need a poison now,<br>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.&#8217;<br>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;<br>
And this same needy man must sell it me.<br>
As I remember, this should be the house.<br>
Being holiday, the beggar&#8217;s shop is shut.<br>
What, ho! apothecary!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Apothecary</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Who calls so loud?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:<br>
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have<br>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br>
As will disperse itself through all the veins<br>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead<br>
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath<br>
As violently as hasty powder fired<br>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua&#8217;s
law<br>
Is death to any he that utters them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<br>
And fear&#8217;st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,<br>
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,<br>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;<br>
The world is not thy friend nor the world&#8217;s law;<br>
The world affords no law to make thee rich;<br>
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">My poverty, but not my will, consents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Put this in any liquid thing you will,<br>
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength<br>
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">There is thy gold, worse poison to men&#8217;s
souls,<br>
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,<br>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<br>
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br>
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br>
To Juliet&#8217;s grave; for there must I use thee.</p>

<p class="speech">Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Friar
Laurence</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">This same should be the voice of Friar John.<br>
Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?<br>
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar John</p>
<p class="speech">Going to find a bare-foot brother out<br>
One of our order, to associate me,<br>
Here in this city visiting the sick,<br>
And finding him, the searchers of the town,<br>
Suspecting that we both were in a house<br>
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,<br>
Seal&#8217;d up the doors, and would not let us forth;<br>
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar John</p>
<p class="speech">I could not send it,&#8212;here it is
again,&#8212;<br>
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,<br>
So fearful were they of infection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,<br>
The letter was not nice but full of charge<br>
Of dear import, and the neglecting it<br>
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;<br>
Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight<br>
Unto my cell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar John</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, I&#8217;ll go and bring it thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Now must I to the monument alone;<br>
Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:<br>
She will beshrew me much that Romeo<br>
Hath had no notice of these accidents;<br>
But I will write again to Mantua,<br>
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;<br>
Poor living corse, closed in a dead man&#8217;s tomb!</p>

Capulets.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Paris, and his Page
bearing flowers and a torch</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand
aloof:<br>
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.<br>
Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,<br>
Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;<br>
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,<br>
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,<br>
But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,<br>
As signal that thou hear&#8217;st something approach.<br>
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I am almost
afraid to stand alone<br>
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Retires</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I
strew,&#8212;<br>
O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;&#8212;<br>
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,<br>
Or, wanting that, with tears distill&#8217;d by moans:<br>
The obsequies that I for thee will keep<br>
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Page whistles</span></p>
<p class="speech">The boy gives warning something doth
approach.<br>
What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,<br>
To cross my obsequies and true love&#8217;s rite?<br>
What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Retires</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo and Balthasar,
with a torch, mattock, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.<br>
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning<br>
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.<br>
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,<br>
Whate&#8217;er thou hear&#8217;st or seest, stand all aloof,<br>
And do not interrupt me in my course.<br>
Why I descend into this bed of death,<br>
Is partly to behold my lady&#8217;s face;<br>
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger<br>
A precious ring, a ring that I must use<br>
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:<br>
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry<br>
In what I further shall intend to do,<br>
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint<br>
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:<br>
The time and my intents are savage-wild,<br>
More fierce and more inexorable far<br>
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou
that:<br>
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> For all this
same, I&#8217;ll hide me hereabout:<br>
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.</p>

<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,<br>
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,<br>
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,<br>
And, in despite, I&#8217;ll cram thee with more food!</p>

<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">This is that banish&#8217;d haughty Montague,<br>
That murder&#8217;d my love&#8217;s cousin, with which grief,<br>
It is supposed, the fair creature died;<br>
And here is come to do some villanous shame<br>
To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Comes forward</span></p>
<p class="speech">Stop thy unhallow&#8217;d toil, vile
Montague!<br>
Can vengeance be pursued further than death?<br>
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:<br>
Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.<br>
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;<br>
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;<br>
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,<br>
Put not another sin upon my head,<br>
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!<br>
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;<br>
For I come hither arm&#8217;d against myself:<br>
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,<br>
A madman&#8217;s mercy bade thee run away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">I do defy thy conjurations,<br>

<p class="speech">If thou be merciful,<br>
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.<br>
Mercutio&#8217;s kinsman, noble County Paris!<br>
What said my man, when my betossed soul<br>
Did not attend him as we rode? I think<br>
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:<br>
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?<br>
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,<br>
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,<br>
One writ with me in sour misfortune&#8217;s book!<br>
I&#8217;ll bury thee in a triumphant grave;<br>
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter&#8217;d youth,<br>
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes<br>
This vault a feasting presence full of light.<br>
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laying Paris in the
tomb</span></p>
<p class="speech">How oft when men are at the point of death<br>
Have they been merry! which their keepers call<br>
A lightning before death: O, how may I<br>
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!<br>
Death, that hath suck&#8217;d the honey of thy breath,<br>
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:<br>
Thou art not conquer&#8217;d; beauty&#8217;s ensign yet<br>
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,<br>
And death&#8217;s pale flag is not advanced there.<br>
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?<br>
O, what more favour can I do to thee,<br>
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain<br>
To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,<br>
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<br>
That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<br>
And never from this palace of dim night<br>
Depart again: here, here will I remain<br>
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here<br>
Will I set up my everlasting rest,<br>
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars<br>
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br>
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you<br>
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss<br>
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!<br>
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!<br>
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on<br>
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!<br>
Here&#8217;s to my love!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drinks</span></p>
<p class="speech">O true apothecary!<br>
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, at the other end of
the churchyard, Friar Laurence, with a lantern, crow, and
spade</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night<br>
Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s one, a friend, and one that knows
you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,<br>
What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light<br>
To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,<br>
It burneth in the Capel&#8217;s monument.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">It doth so, holy sir; and there&#8217;s my
master,<br>
One that you love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Who is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">How long hath he been there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">Full half an hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Go with me to the vault.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">I dare not, sir<br>
My master knows not but I am gone hence;<br>
And fearfully did menace me with death,<br>
If I did stay to look on his intents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, then; I&#8217;ll go alone. Fear comes upon
me:<br>
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,<br>
I dreamt my master and another fought,<br>
And that my master slew him.</p>

<p class="speech">Alack, alack, what blood is this, which
stains<br>
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?<br>
What mean these masterless and gory swords<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enters the tomb</span></p>
<p class="speech">Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?<br>
And steep&#8217;d in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour<br>
Is guilty of this lamentable chance!<br>
The lady stirs.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Juliet wakes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O comfortable friar! where is my lord?<br>
I do remember well where I should be,<br>
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Noise within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest<br>
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:<br>
A greater power than we can contradict<br>
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.<br>
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;<br>
And Paris too. Come, I&#8217;ll dispose of thee<br>
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:<br>
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;<br>
Come, go, good Juliet,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Noise again</span></p>
<p class="speech">I dare no longer stay.</p>

Laurence</span></p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s here? a cup, closed in my true
love&#8217;s hand?<br>
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:<br>
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop<br>
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;<br>
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,<br>
To make die with a restorative.</p>

Go, some of you, whoe&#8217;er you find attach.<br>
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,<br>
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,<br>
Who here hath lain these two days buried.<br>
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:<br>
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:<br>

<p class="speech">Here is a friar, and slaughter&#8217;d
Romeo&#8217;s man;<br>
With instruments upon them, fit to open<br>
These dead men&#8217;s tombs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter
bleeds!<br>
This dagger hath mista&#8217;en&#8212;for, lo, his house<br>
Is empty on the back of Montague,&#8212;<br>
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter&#8217;s bosom!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O me! this sight of death is as a bell,<br>
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Montague and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Montague; for thou art early up,<br>
To see thy son and heir more early down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;<br>
Grief of my son&#8217;s exile hath stopp&#8217;d her breath:<br>
What further woe conspires against mine age?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Look, and thou shalt see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">O thou untaught! what manners is in this?<br>
To press before thy father to a grave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,<br>
Till we can clear these ambiguities,<br>
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;<br>
And then will I be general of your woes,<br>
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,<br>
And let mischance be slave to patience.<br>
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">I am the greatest, able to do least,<br>
Yet most suspected, as the time and place<br>
Doth make against me of this direful murder;<br>
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge<br>
Myself condemned and myself excused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Then say at once what thou dost know in this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br>
And she, there dead, that Romeo&#8217;s faithful wife:<br>
I married them; and their stol&#8217;n marriage-day<br>
Was Tybalt&#8217;s dooms-day, whose untimely death<br>
Banish&#8217;d the new-made bridegroom from the city,<br>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>
Betroth&#8217;d and would have married her perforce<br>
To County Paris: then comes she to me,<br>
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean<br>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
Then gave I her, so tutor&#8217;d by my art,<br>
A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,<br>
That he should hither come as this dire night,<br>
To help to take her from her borrow&#8217;d grave,<br>
Being the time the potion&#8217;s force should cease.<br>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>
Was stay&#8217;d by accident, and yesternight<br>
Return&#8217;d my letter back. Then all alone<br>
At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br>
Came I to take her from her kindred&#8217;s vault;<br>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,<br>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:<br>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,<br>
And bear this work of heaven with patience:<br>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>
All this I know; and to the marriage<br>
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this<br>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,<br>
Unto the rigour of severest law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">We still have known thee for a holy man.<br>
Where&#8217;s Romeo&#8217;s man? what can he say in this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">I brought my master news of Juliet&#8217;s
death;<br>
And then in post he came from Mantua<br>
To this same place, to this same monument.<br>
This letter he early bid me give his father,<br>
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<br>
I departed not and left him there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the letter; I will look on it.<br>
Where is the county&#8217;s page, that raised the watch?<br>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">He came with flowers to strew his lady&#8217;s
grave;<br>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:<br>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<br>
And by and by my master drew on him;<br>
And then I ran away to call the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">This letter doth make good the friar&#8217;s
words,<br>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:<br>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>
Of a poor &#8217;pothecary, and therewithal<br>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br>
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!<br>
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.<br>
And I for winking at your discords too<br>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O brother Montague, give me thy hand:<br>
This is my daughter&#8217;s jointure, for no more<br>
Can I demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But I can give thee more:<br>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;<br>
That while Verona by that name is known,<br>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">As rich shall Romeo&#8217;s by his lady&#8217;s
lie;<br>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br>
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:<br>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<br>
Some shall be pardon&#8217;d, and some punished:<br>
For never was a story of more woe<br>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>
