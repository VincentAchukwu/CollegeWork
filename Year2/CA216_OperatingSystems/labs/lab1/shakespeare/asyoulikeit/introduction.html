<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> is a pastoral comedy written by William
Shakespeare, in 1599 or early 1600. <em>As You Like It</em> was
listed in the Stationers&#8217; Register, the period equivalent of
copyright, in August 1600. No printed copy of it is known prior to
the publication of the First Folio of Shakespeare&#8217;s collected
works in 1623. The real life village of Hampton-in-Arden was used
as the setting for the play.</p>
<p>Shakespeare drew the story for <em>As You Like It</em> from a
story called &#8220;Rosalynde, Euphues&#8217; Golden Legacy&#8221;
written by Thomas Lodge and published in 1590. In
Shakespeare&#8217;s version, Frederick has usurped the Duchy and
exiled his older brother, referred to only as the Duke. The
Duke&#8217;s daughter Rosalind has been permitted to remain at
court because she is the closest friend of Frederick&#8217;s only
child, Celia. Orlando, a young gentleman of the duchy who has
fallen in love with Rosalind, is forced to flee his home after
being persecuted by his older brother, Oliver. Frederick becomes
angry and orders Rosalind to flee his court. Celia and Rosalind
decide to flee together accompanied by the jester Touchstone, with
Rosalind disguised as a young man.</p>
<p>Rosalind, now known as Ganymede, and Celia, now known as Aliena,
arrive in the Forest of Arden, where the exiled Duke now lives with
some supporters, including Jacques. Orlando has found the Duke and
his men already and is living with them and posting love poems for
Rosalind on the trees. Rosalind, also in love with Orlando, meets
him as Ganymede and pretends to counsel him to cure him of being in
love. Meanwhile, the shepherdess Phebe, with whom Silvius is in
love, has fallen in love with Ganymede.</p>
<p>Orlando sees Oliver in the forest and rescues him from a
lioness, causing Oliver to repent of mistreating Orlando. Oliver
meets Aliena and falls in love with her, and they agree to marry.
Orlando and Rosalind, Oliver and Celia, Silvius and Phebe, and
Touchstone and Audrey all are married in the final scene, after
which they discover that Frederick has also repented his faults,
deciding to restore his legitimate brother to the dukedom and adopt
a religious life.</p>
<p>The elaborate gender reversals in the story are of particular
interest to many modern critics with their love of gender analysis.
At one point, Rosalind &#8212; who in Shakespeare&#8217;s day would
have been a boy playing a girl &#8212; becomes a girl pretending to
be a boy pretending to be a girl.</p>
<p>In Act II, Scene 7, line 138, it features one of
Shakespeare&#8217;s greatest monologues, which begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;All the world&#8217;s a stage<br>
And all the men and women merely players;<br>
They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages...&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> also features much humorous and clever
wordplay, and several entangled love affairs, all in a serene
pastoral setting which makes it often especially effective staged
outdoors in a park or similar site.</p>
<p><em>As You Like It</em> has always been among the most produced
of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays.</p>
