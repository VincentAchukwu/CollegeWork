- Grammar: {
            S->aSb,
            S->ab
            }

- Example: derivation of "aabb":
            S -> aSb -> aabb

- Type of language/grammar: I believe the grammar describes Type-2 Context-free grammar, since the rules are of the form A -> psi, where left-hand-side (A) is 
non-terminal, right-hand-side (psi) is terminal and non-terminal

- Grammar: {
            S->aaAB,
            A->aA,
            A->"",
            B->bbbB,
            B->""
            }

- Example: derivation of "aaabbb":
            S -> aaAB -> aaaAB -> aaaB -> aaabbbB -> aaabbb

- Type of language/grammar: I believe the grammar describes Type-1 Context-sensitive 
grammar as the rules suggest that they are non-shrinking. In all cases, there must 
be at least two a's (i.e when n is 0, there are two a's and zero b's)
