<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title="Scene I. Venice. A street.">
<h4>Scene I. Venice. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Roderigo and
Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly<br>
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse<br>
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Sblood, but you will not hear me:<br>
If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou told&#8217;st me thou didst hold him in thy
hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the
city,<br>
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,<br>
Off-capp&#8217;d to him: and, by the faith of man,<br>
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:<br>
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,<br>
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance<br>
Horribly stuff&#8217;d with epithets of war;<br>
And, in conclusion,<br>
Nonsuits my mediators; for, &#8216;Certes,&#8217; says he,<br>
&#8216;I have already chose my officer.&#8217;<br>
And what was he?<br>
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,<br>
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,<br>
A fellow almost damn&#8217;d in a fair wife;<br>
That never set a squadron in the field,<br>
Nor the division of a battle knows<br>
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,<br>
Wherein the toged consuls can propose<br>
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,<br>
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:<br>
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof<br>
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds<br>
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee&#8217;d and calm&#8217;d<br>
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,<br>
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,<br>
And I&#8212;God bless the mark!&#8212;his Moorship&#8217;s
ancient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I rather would have been his
hangman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there&#8217;s no remedy; &#8217;tis the
curse of service,<br>
Preferment goes by letter and affection,<br>
And not by old gradation, where each second<br>
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,<br>
Whether I in any just term am affined<br>
To love the Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I would not follow him then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, content you;<br>
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:<br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>
Cannot be truly follow&#8217;d. You shall mark<br>
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,<br>
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,<br>
Wears out his time, much like his master&#8217;s ass,<br>
For nought but provender, and when he&#8217;s old,
cashier&#8217;d:<br>
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are<br>
Who, trimm&#8217;d in forms and visages of duty,<br>
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,<br>
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,<br>
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats<br>
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;<br>
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,<br>
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,<br>
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:<br>
In following him, I follow but myself;<br>
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,<br>
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:<br>
For when my outward action doth demonstrate<br>
The native act and figure of my heart<br>
In compliment extern, &#8217;tis not long after<br>
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve<br>
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">What a full fortune does the thicklips owe<br>
If he can carry&#8217;t thus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Call up her father,<br>
Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,<br>
Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,<br>
And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,<br>
Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,<br>
Yet throw such changes of vexation on&#8217;t,<br>
As it may lose some colour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Here is her father&#8217;s house; I&#8217;ll call
aloud.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell<br>
As when, by night and negligence, the fire<br>
Is spied in populous cities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves!
thieves!<br>
Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!<br>
Thieves! thieves!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Brabantio appears above, at a
window</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">What is the reason of this terrible summons?<br>
What is the matter there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Signior, is all your family within?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Are your doors lock&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, wherefore ask you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, sir, you&#8217;re robb&#8217;d;
for shame, put on
your gown;<br>
Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;<br>
Even now, now, very now, an old black ram<br>
Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;<br>
Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,<br>
Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:<br>
Arise, I say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What, have you lost your wits?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Not I what are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">My name is Roderigo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">The worser welcome:<br>
I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:<br>
In honest plainness thou hast heard me say<br>
My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,<br>
Being full of supper and distempering draughts,<br>
Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come<br>
To start my quiet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sir, sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But thou must needs be sure<br>
My spirit and my place have in them power<br>
To make this bitter to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">What tell&#8217;st thou me of robbing? this is
Venice;<br>
My house is not a grange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Most grave Brabantio,<br>
In simple and pure soul I come to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, sir, you are one of those that
will not
serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
do you service and you think we are ruffians, you&#8217;ll
have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
you&#8217;ll have your nephews neigh to you; you&#8217;ll have
coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">What profane wretch art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your
daughter
and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You are&#8212;a senator.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">This thou shalt answer; I know thee,
Roderigo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech
you,<br>
If&#8217;t be your pleasure and most wise consent,<br>
As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,<br>
At this odd-even and dull watch o&#8217; the night,<br>
Transported, with no worse nor better guard<br>
But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,<br>
To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor&#8212;<br>
If this be known to you and your allowance,<br>
We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;<br>
But if you know not this, my manners tell me<br>
We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe<br>
That, from the sense of all civility,<br>
I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:<br>
Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,<br>
I say again, hath made a gross revolt;<br>
Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes<br>
In an extravagant and wheeling stranger<br>
Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:<br>
If she be in her chamber or your house,<br>
Let loose on me the justice of the state<br>
For thus deluding you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Strike on the tinder, ho!<br>
Give me a taper! call up all my people!<br>
This accident is not unlike my dream:<br>
Belief of it oppresses me already.<br>
Light, I say! light!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell; for I must leave you:<br>
It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,<br>
To be produced&#8212;as, if I stay, I shall&#8212;<br>
Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,<br>
However this may gall him with some cheque,<br>
Cannot with safety cast him, for he&#8217;s embark&#8217;d<br>
With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,<br>
Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,<br>
Another of his fathom they have none,<br>
To lead their business: in which regard,<br>
Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.<br>
Yet, for necessity of present life,<br>
I must show out a flag and sign of love,<br>
Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,<br>
Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;<br>
And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, below, Brabantio, and
Servants with torches</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">It is too true an evil: gone she is;<br>
And what&#8217;s to come of my despised time<br>
Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,<br>
Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!<br>
With the Moor, say&#8217;st thou? Who would be a father!<br>
How didst thou know &#8217;twas she? O she deceives me<br>
Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:<br>
Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I think they are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the
blood!<br>
Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters&#8217; minds<br>
By what you see them act. Is there not charms<br>
By which the property of youth and maidhood<br>
May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,<br>
Of some such thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir, I have indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!<br>
Some one way, some another. Do you know<br>
Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I think I can discover him, if you please,<br>
To get good guard and go along with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, lead on. At every house I&#8217;ll
call;<br>
I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!<br>
And raise some special officers of night.<br>
On, good Roderigo: I&#8217;ll deserve your pains.</p>

<div id="act1.2" class="scene" title="Scene II. Another street.">
<h4>Scene II. Another street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Othello, Iago, and
Attendants with torches</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Though in the trade of war I have slain men,<br>
Yet do I hold it very stuff o&#8217; the conscience<br>
To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity<br>
Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times<br>
I had thought to have yerk&#8217;d him here under the ribs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis better as it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but he prated,<br>
And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms<br>
Against your honour<br>
That, with the little godliness I have,<br>
I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,<br>
Are you fast married? Be assured of this,<br>
That the magnifico is much beloved,<br>
And hath in his effect a voice potential<br>
As double as the duke&#8217;s: he will divorce you;<br>
Or put upon you what restraint and grievance<br>
The law, with all his might to enforce it on,<br>
Will give him cable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Let him do his spite:<br>
My services which I have done the signiory<br>
Shall out-tongue his complaints. &#8217;Tis yet to know,&#8212;<br>
Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,<br>
I shall promulgate&#8212;I fetch my life and being<br>
From men of royal siege, and my demerits<br>
May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune<br>
As this that I have reach&#8217;d: for know, Iago,<br>
But that I love the gentle Desdemona,<br>
I would not my unhoused free condition<br>
Put into circumscription and confine<br>
For the sea&#8217;s worth. But, look! what lights come yond?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Those are the raised father and his friends:<br>
You were best go in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Not I I must be found:<br>
My parts, my title and my perfect soul<br>
Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">By Janus, I think no.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassio, and certain
Officers with torches</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.<br>
The goodness of the night upon you, friends!<br>
What is the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The duke does greet you,
general,<br>
And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,<br>
Even on the instant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Something from Cyprus as I may divine:<br>
It is a business of some heat: the galleys<br>
Have sent a dozen sequent messengers<br>
This very night at one another&#8217;s heels,<br>
And many of the consuls, raised and met,<br>
Are at the duke&#8217;s already: you have been
hotly call&#8217;d for;<br>
When, being not at your lodging to be found,<br>
The senate hath sent about three several guests<br>
To search you out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well I am found by you.<br>
I will but spend a word here in the house,<br>
And go with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ancient, what makes he here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land
carack:<br>
If it prove lawful prize, he&#8217;s made for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I do not understand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s married.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">To who?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Othello</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, to&#8212;Come, captain, will you go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Have with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes another troop to seek for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">It is Brabantio. General, be advised;<br>
He comes to bad intent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Brabantio, Roderigo,
and Officers with torches and weapons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Holla! stand there!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Signior, it is the Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Down with him, thief!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They draw on both
sides</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust
them.<br>
Good signior, you shall more command with years<br>
Than with your weapons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow&#8217;d
my daughter?<br>
Damn&#8217;d as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;<br>
For I&#8217;ll refer me to all things of sense,<br>
If she in chains of magic were not bound,<br>
Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,<br>
So opposite to marriage that she shunned<br>
The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,<br>
Would ever have, to incur a general mock,<br>
Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom<br>
Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.<br>
Judge me the world, if &#8217;tis not gross in sense<br>
That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,<br>
Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals<br>
That weaken motion: I&#8217;ll have&#8217;t disputed on;<br>
&#8217;Tis probable and palpable to thinking.<br>
I therefore apprehend and do attach thee<br>
For an abuser of the world, a practiser<br>
Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.<br>
Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,<br>
Subdue him at his peril.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Hold your hands,<br>
Both you of my inclining, and the rest:<br>
Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it<br>
Without a prompter. Where will you that I go<br>
To answer this your charge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">To prison, till fit time<br>
Of law and course of direct session<br>
Call thee to answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What if I do obey?<br>
How may the duke be therewith satisfied,<br>
Whose messengers are here about my side,<br>
Upon some present business of the state<br>
To bring me to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, most worthy signior;<br>
The duke&#8217;s in council and your noble self,<br>
I am sure, is sent for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">How! the duke in council!<br>
In this time of the night! Bring him away:<br>
Mine&#8217;s not an idle cause: the duke himself,<br>
Or any of my brothers of the state,<br>
Cannot but feel this wrong as &#8217;twere their own;<br>
For if such actions may have passage free,<br>
Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.</p>

<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">How say you by this change?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">This cannot be,<br>
By no assay of reason: &#8217;tis a pageant,<br>
To keep us in false gaze. When we consider<br>
The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,<br>
And let ourselves again but understand,<br>
That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,<br>
So may he with more facile question bear it,<br>
For that it stands not in such warlike brace,<br>
But altogether lacks the abilities<br>
That Rhodes is dress&#8217;d in: if we make thought of this,<br>
We must not think the Turk is so unskilful<br>
To leave that latest which concerns him first,<br>
Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,<br>
To wake and wage a danger profitless.</p>

<p class="speech">I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;<br>
We lack&#8217;d your counsel and your help tonight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;<br>
Neither my place nor aught I heard of business<br>
Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care<br>
Take hold on me, for my particular grief<br>
Is of so flood-gate and o&#8217;erbearing nature<br>
That it engluts and swallows other sorrows<br>
And it is still itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter! O, my daughter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speaker">Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to me;<br>
She is abused, stol&#8217;n from me, and corrupted<br>
By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;<br>
For nature so preposterously to err,<br>
Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,<br>
Sans witchcraft could not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">Whoe&#8217;er he be that in this foul

Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself<br>

your own part, can you say to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, but this is so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,<br>
My very noble and approved good masters,<br>
That I have ta&#8217;en away this old man&#8217;s daughter,<br>
It is most true; true, I have married her:<br>
The very head and front of my offending<br>
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,<br>
And little bless&#8217;d with the soft phrase of peace:<br>
For since these arms of mine had seven years&#8217; pith,<br>
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used<br>
Their dearest action in the tented field,<br>
And little of this great world can I speak,<br>
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,<br>
And therefore little shall I grace my cause<br>
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,<br>
I will a round unvarnish&#8217;d tale deliver<br>
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,<br>
What conjuration and what mighty magic,<br>
For such proceeding I am charged withal,<br>
I won his daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">A maiden never bold;<br>
Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion<br>
Blush&#8217;d at herself; and she, in spite of nature,<br>
Of years, of country, credit, every thing,<br>
To fall in love with what she fear&#8217;d to look on!<br>
It is a judgment maim&#8217;d and most imperfect<br>
That will confess perfection so could err<br>
Against all rules of nature, and must be driven<br>
To find out practises of cunning hell,<br>
Why this should be. I therefore vouch again<br>
That with some mixtures powerful o&#8217;er the blood,<br>
Or with some dram conjured to this effect,<br>
He wrought upon her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">To vouch this, is no proof,<br>
Without more wider and more overt test<br>
Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods<br>
Of modern seeming do prefer against him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">But, Othello, speak:<br>
Did you by indirect and forced courses<br>
Subdue and poison this young maid&#8217;s affections?<br>
Or came it by request and such fair question<br>
As soul to soul affordeth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you,<br>
Send for the lady to the Sagittary,<br>
And let her speak of me before her father:<br>
If you do find me foul in her report,<br>
The trust, the office I do hold of you,<br>
Not only take away, but let your sentence<br>
Even fall upon my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>

place.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Iago and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, till she come, as truly as to heaven<br>
I do confess the vices of my blood,<br>
So justly to your grave ears I&#8217;ll present<br>
How I did thrive in this fair lady&#8217;s love,<br>
And she in mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">Say it, Othello.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Her father loved me; oft invited me;<br>
Still question&#8217;d me the story of my life,<br>
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,<br>
That I have passed.<br>
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,<br>
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;<br>
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,<br>
Of moving accidents by flood and field<br>
Of hair-breadth scapes i&#8217; the imminent deadly breach,<br>
Of being taken by the insolent foe<br>
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence<br>
And portance in my travels&#8217; history:<br>
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,<br>
Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven<br>
It was my hint to speak,&#8212;such was the process;<br>
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,<br>
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads<br>
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear<br>
Would Desdemona seriously incline:<br>
But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:<br>
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,<br>
She&#8217;ld come again, and with a greedy ear<br>
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,<br>
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means<br>
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart<br>
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,<br>
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,<br>
But not intentively: I did consent,<br>
And often did beguile her of her tears,<br>
When I did speak of some distressful stroke<br>
That my youth suffer&#8217;d. My story being done,<br>
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:<br>
She swore, in faith, twas strange, &#8217;twas passing strange,<br>
&#8217;Twas pitiful, &#8217;twas wondrous pitiful:<br>
She wish&#8217;d she had not heard it, yet she wish&#8217;d<br>
That heaven had made her such a man: she thank&#8217;d me,<br>
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,<br>
I should but teach him how to tell my story.<br>
And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:<br>
She loved me for the dangers I had pass&#8217;d,<br>
And I loved her that she did pity them.<br>
This only is the witchcraft I have used:<br>
Here comes the lady; let her witness it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Desdemona, Iago, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">I think this tale would win my daughter too.<br>
Good Brabantio,<br>
Take up this mangled matter at the best:<br>
Men do their broken weapons rather use<br>
Than their bare hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, hear her speak:<br>
If she confess that she was half the wooer,<br>
Destruction on my head, if my bad blame<br>
Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:<br>
Do you perceive in all this noble company<br>
Where most you owe obedience?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">My noble father,<br>
I do perceive here a divided duty:<br>
To you I am bound for life and education;<br>
My life and education both do learn me<br>
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;<br>
I am hitherto your daughter: but here&#8217;s my husband,<br>
And so much duty as my mother show&#8217;d<br>
To you, preferring you before her father,<br>
So much I challenge that I may profess<br>
Due to the Moor my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">God be wi&#8217; you! I have done.<br>
Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:<br>
I had rather to adopt a child than get it.<br>
Come hither, Moor:<br>
I here do give thee that with all my heart<br>
Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart<br>
I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,<br>
I am glad at soul I have no other child:<br>
For thy escape would teach me tyranny,<br>
To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">Let me speak like yourself, and lay a
sentence,<br>
Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers<br>
Into your favour.<br>
When remedies are past, the griefs are ended<br>
By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.<br>
To mourn a mischief that is past and gone<br>
Is the next way to draw new mischief on.<br>
What cannot be preserved when fortune takes<br>
Patience her injury a mockery makes.<br>
The robb&#8217;d that smiles steals something from the thief;<br>
He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;<br>
We lose it not, so long as we can smile.<br>
He bears the sentence well that nothing bears<br>
But the free comfort which from thence he hears,<br>
But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow<br>
That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.<br>
These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,<br>
Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:<br>
But words are words; I never yet did hear<br>
That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.<br>
I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes
for
Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
known to you; and though we have there a substitute
of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
voice on you: you must therefore be content to
slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
more stubborn and boisterous expedition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">The tyrant custom, most grave senators,<br>
Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war<br>
My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise<br>
A natural and prompt alacrity<br>
I find in hardness, and do undertake<br>
These present wars against the Ottomites.<br>
Most humbly therefore bending to your state,<br>
I crave fit disposition for my wife.<br>
Due reference of place and exhibition,<br>
With such accommodation and besort<br>
As levels with her breeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">If you please,<br>
Be&#8217;t at her father&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brabantio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not have it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nor I; I would not there
reside,<br>
To put my father in impatient thoughts<br>
By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,<br>
To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;<br>
And let me find a charter in your voice,<br>
To assist my simpleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>
<p class="speech">What would You, Desdemona?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">That I did love the Moor to live with him,<br>
My downright violence and storm of fortunes<br>
May trumpet to the world: my heart&#8217;s subdued<br>
Even to the very quality of my lord:<br>
I saw Othello&#8217;s visage in his mind,<br>
And to his honour and his valiant parts<br>
Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.<br>
So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,<br>
A moth of peace, and he go to the war,<br>
The rites for which I love him are bereft me,<br>
And I a heavy interim shall support<br>
By his dear absence. Let me go with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Let her have your voices.<br>
Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,<br>
To please the palate of my appetite,<br>
Nor to comply with heat&#8212;the young affects<br>
In me defunct&#8212;and proper satisfaction.<br>
But to be free and bounteous to her mind:<br>
And heaven defend your good souls, that you think<br>
I will your serious and great business scant<br>
For she is with me: no, when light-wing&#8217;d toys<br>
Of feather&#8217;d Cupid seal with wanton dullness<br>
My speculative and officed instruments,<br>
That my disports corrupt and taint my business,<br>
Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,<br>
And all indign and base adversities<br>
Make head against my estimation!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Venice</p>

<p class="speech">What will I do, thinkest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, go to bed, and sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I will incontinently drown myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">If thou dost, I shall never love thee after.
Why,
thou silly gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">It is silliness to live when to live is torment;
and
then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O villainous! I have looked upon the world for
four
times seven years; and since I could distinguish
betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
would change my humanity with a baboon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be
so
fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Virtue! a fig! &#8217;tis in ourselves that we
are thus
or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
distract it with many, either to have it sterile
with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
you call love to be a sect or scion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">It cannot be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission
of
the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
love to the Moor,&#8212; put money in thy purse,&#8212;nor he
his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
shalt see an answerable sequestration:&#8212;put but
money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
their wills: fill thy purse with money:&#8212;the food
that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
she will find the error of her choice: she must
have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
to be drowned and go without her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
the issue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art sure of me:&#8212;go, make
money:&#8212;I have told
thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
of this to-morrow. Adieu.</p>

And it is thought abroad, that &#8217;twixt my sheets<br>
He has done my office: I know not if&#8217;t be true;<br>
But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,<br>
Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;<br>
The better shall my purpose work on him.<br>
Cassio&#8217;s a proper man: let me see now:<br>
To get his place and to plume up my will<br>
In double knavery&#8212;How, how? Let&#8217;s see:&#8212;<br>
After some time, to abuse Othello&#8217;s ear<br>
That he is too familiar with his wife.<br>
He hath a person and a smooth dispose<br>
To be suspected, framed to make women false.<br>
The Moor is of a free and open nature,<br>
That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,<br>
And will as tenderly be led by the nose<br>
As asses are.<br>
I have&#8217;t. It is engender&#8217;d. Hell and night<br>

The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.<br>
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</p>

If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<br>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>

<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst

But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>

You say true; &#8217;tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft, which now again you are most apt to play the

And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas<br>

Come
hither. If thou be&#8217;st valiant,&#8212; as, they say, base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them&#8212;list me. The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard:&#8212;first, I must tell thee this&#8212;Desdemona is
directly in love with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">With him! why, &#8217;tis not possible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be
instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
and will she love him still for prating? let not
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now, sir, this granted,&#8212;as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position&#8212;who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does? a knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
hath found him already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot believe that in her; she&#8217;s full
of
most blessed condition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Blessed fig&#8217;s-end! the wine she drinks is
made of
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
not mark that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure
prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
for the command, I&#8217;ll lay&#8217;t upon you. Cassio knows
you not. I&#8217;ll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and
haply
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
impediment most profitably removed, without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I will do this, if I can bring it to any
opportunity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the
citadel:<br>
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br>
That she loves him, &#8217;tis apt and of great credit:<br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<br>
And I dare think he&#8217;ll prove to Desdemona<br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;<br>
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure<br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin,<br>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>
Hath leap&#8217;d into my seat; the thought whereof<br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;<br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>
Till I am even&#8217;d with him, wife for wife,<br>
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br>
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br>
I&#8217;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb&#8212;<br>
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too&#8212;<br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.<br>
For making him egregiously an ass<br>
And practising upon his peace and quiet<br>
Even to madness. &#8217;Tis here, but yet confused:<br>

Let&#8217;s teach ourselves that honourable stop,<br>
Not to outsport discretion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Iago hath direction what to do;<br>
But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye<br>
Will I look to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Iago is most honest.<br>
Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest<br>
Let me have speech with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Desdemona</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, my dear love,<br>
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<br>
That profit&#8217;s yet to come &#8217;tween me and you.<br>
Good night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello, Desdemona,
and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Not this hour, lieutenant; &#8217;tis not yet ten
o&#8217; the
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a most exquisite lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And, I&#8217;ll warrant her, fun of game.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, she&#8217;s a most fresh and delicate
creature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley
of
provocation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">An inviting eye; and yet methinks right
modest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to
love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She is indeed perfection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Well, happiness to their sheets! Come,
lieutenant, I
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, they are our friends; but one cup: I&#8217;ll
drink for
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that
was
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
and dare not task my weakness with any more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What, man! &#8217;tis a night of revels: the
gallants
desire it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Where are they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t; but it dislikes me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">If I can fasten but one cup upon him,<br>
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,<br>
He&#8217;ll be as full of quarrel and offence<br>
As my young mistress&#8217; dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,<br>
Whom love hath turn&#8217;d almost the wrong side out,<br>
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused<br>
Potations pottle-deep; and he&#8217;s to watch:<br>
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,<br>
That hold their honours in a wary distance,<br>
The very elements of this warlike isle,<br>
Have I to-night fluster&#8217;d with flowing cups,<br>
And they watch too. Now, &#8217;mongst this flock of drunkards,<br>
Am I to put our Cassio in some action<br>
That may offend the isle.&#8212;But here they come:<br>
If consequence do but approve my dream,<br>
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Cassio; with him
Montano and Gentlemen; servants following with wine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, they have given me a rouse
already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I
am
a soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Some wine, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">And let me the canakin clink, clink;<br>
And let me the canakin clink<br>
A soldier&#8217;s a man;<br>
A life&#8217;s but a span;<br>
Why, then, let a soldier drink.<br>
Some wine, boys!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, an excellent song.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I learned it in England, where, indeed, they
are
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
your swag-bellied Hollander&#8212;Drink, ho!&#8212;are nothing
to your English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane
dead
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
can be filled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">To the health of our general!</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">I am for it, lieutenant; and I&#8217;ll do you
justice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O sweet England!<br>
King Stephen was a worthy peer,<br>
His breeches cost him but a crown;<br>
He held them sixpence all too dear,<br>
With that he call&#8217;d the tailor lown.<br>
He was a wight of high renown,<br>
And thou art but of low degree:<br>
&#8217;Tis pride that pulls the country down;<br>
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.<br>
Some wine, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is a more exquisite song than the
other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hear&#8217;t again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place
that
does those things. Well, God&#8217;s above all; and there
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">It&#8217;s true, good lieutenant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">For mine own part,&#8212;no offence to the
general, nor
any man of quality,&#8212;I hope to be saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And so do I too, lieutenant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let&#8217;s
have no more of this; let&#8217;s to our affairs.&#8212;Forgive
us our sins!&#8212;Gentlemen, let&#8217;s look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
speak well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well then; you must not think then that
I am drunk.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">To the platform, masters; come, let&#8217;s set
the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You see this fellow that is gone before;<br>
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<br>
And give direction: and do but see his vice;<br>
&#8217;Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<br>
The one as long as the other: &#8217;tis pity of him.<br>
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.<br>
On some odd time of his infirmity,<br>
Will shake this island.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">But is he often thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis evermore the prologue to his
sleep:<br>
He&#8217;ll watch the horologe a double set,<br>
If drink rock not his cradle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">It were well<br>
The general were put in mind of it.<br>
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature<br>
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,<br>
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Roderigo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to him]</span> How
now, Roderigo!<br>
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Roderigo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">And &#8217;tis great pity that the noble Moor<br>
Should hazard such a place as his own second<br>
With one of an ingraft infirmity:<br>
It were an honest action to say<br>
So to the Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not I, for this fair island:<br>
I do love Cassio well; and would do much<br>
To cure him of this evil&#8212;But, hark! what noise?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cry within: &#8216;Help!
help!&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">You rogue! you rascal!</p>

<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">A knave teach me my duty!<br>
I&#8217;ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>

<p class="speaker">Montano</p>

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the
death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Faints</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, ho!
Lieutenant,&#8212;sir&#8212;Montano,&#8212;gentlemen,&#8212;<br>
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<br>
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?<br>
Are we turn&#8217;d Turks, and to ourselves do that<br>
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<br>
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:<br>
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<br>
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<br>
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle<br>
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<br>
Honest Iago, that look&#8217;st dead with grieving,<br>
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know: friends all but now, even now,<br>
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom<br>
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now&#8212;<br>
As if some planet had unwitted men&#8212;<br>
Swords out, and tilting one at other&#8217;s breast,<br>
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<br>
Any beginning to this peevish odds;<br>
And would in action glorious I had lost<br>
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;<br>
The gravity and stillness of your youth<br>
The world hath noted, and your name is great<br>
In mouths of wisest censure: what&#8217;s the matter,<br>
That you unlace your reputation thus<br>
And spend your rich opinion for the name<br>
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:<br>
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,&#8212;<br>
While I spare speech, which something now
offends me,&#8212;<br>
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught<br>
By me that&#8217;s said or done amiss this night;<br>
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br>
And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br>
When violence assails us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by heaven,<br>
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;<br>
And passion, having my best judgment collied,<br>
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,<br>
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br>
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br>
How this foul rout began, who set it on;<br>
And he that is approved in this offence,<br>
Though he had twinn&#8217;d with me, both at a birth,<br>
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,<br>
Yet wild, the people&#8217;s hearts brimful of fear,<br>
To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br>
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!<br>
&#8217;Tis monstrous. Iago, who began&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">If partially affined, or leagued in office,<br>
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br>
Thou art no soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Touch me not so near:<br>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;<br>
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.<br>
Montano and myself being in speech,<br>
There comes a fellow crying out for help:<br>
And Cassio following him with determined sword,<br>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br>
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<br>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br>
Lest by his clamour&#8212;as it so fell out&#8212;<br>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<br>
Outran my purpose; and I return&#8217;d the rather<br>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<br>
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night<br>
I ne&#8217;er might say before. When I came back&#8212;<br>
For this was brief&#8212;I found them close together,<br>
At blow and thrust; even as again they were<br>
When you yourself did part them.<br>
More of this matter cannot I report:<br>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:<br>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<br>
Which patience could not pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I know, Iago,<br>
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<br>
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee<br>
But never more be officer of mine.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Desdemona,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!<br>
I&#8217;ll make thee an example.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">All&#8217;s well now, sweeting; come away to
bed.<br>
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:<br>
Lead him off.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Montano, who is led
off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Iago, look with care about the town,<br>
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.<br>
Come, Desdemona: &#8217;tis the soldiers&#8217; life<br>
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Iago and
Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, past all surgery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have
lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">As I am an honest man, I thought you had
received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again, and he&#8217;s yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive
so
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one&#8217;s own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
let us call thee devil!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What was he that you followed with your sword?<br>
What
had he done to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I remember a mass of things, but nothing
distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, but you are now well enough: how came you
thus
recovered?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give
place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another, to make me frankly despise myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the
time,
the place, and the condition of this country
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell
me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, good wine is a good familiar
creature,
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You or any man living may be drunk! at a time,
man.
I&#8217;ll tell you what you shall do. Our general&#8217;s wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">You advise me well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest
kindness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I
will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant;
I
must to the watch.
Cassio: Good night, honest Iago.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And what&#8217;s he then that says I play the
villain?<br>
When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>
Probal to thinking and indeed the course<br>
To win the Moor again? For &#8217;tis most easy<br>
The inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>
In any honest suit: she&#8217;s framed as fruitful<br>
As the free elements. And then for her<br>
To win the Moor&#8212;were&#8217;t to renounce his baptism,<br>
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,<br>
His soul is so enfetter&#8217;d to her love,<br>
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>
Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>
With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br>
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br>
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>
When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool<br>
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes<br>
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>
I&#8217;ll pour this pestilence into his ear,<br>
That she repeals him for her body&#8217;s lust;<br>
And by how much she strives to do him good,<br>
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>
And out of her own goodness make the net<br>
That shall enmesh them all.</p>

<p class="speech">How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound
that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.</p>

What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<br>
Thou know&#8217;st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;<br>

And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier&#8217;d Cassio:<br>
Though other things grow fair against the sun,<br>
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:<br>
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, &#8217;tis morning;<br>

But, masters, here&#8217;s money for you: and the general

That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,<br>
And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom<br>
He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you<br>
And needs no other suitor but his likings<br>
To take the safest occasion by the front<br>
To bring you in again.</p>

<p class="speech">Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,<br>
If I have any grace or power to move you,<br>
His present reconciliation take;<br>
For if he be not one that truly loves you,<br>
That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,<br>
I have no judgment in an honest face:<br>
I prithee, call him back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Went he hence now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>

<p class="speech">Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;<br>
On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:<br>
I prithee, name the time, but let it not<br>
Exceed three days: in faith, he&#8217;s penitent;<br>
And yet his trespass, in our common reason&#8212;<br>
Save that, they say, the wars must make examples<br>
Out of their best&#8212;is not almost a fault<br>
To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?<br>
Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,<br>
What you would ask me, that I should deny,<br>
Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,<br>
That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,<br>
When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,<br>
Hath ta&#8217;en your part; to have so much to do<br>
To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;<br>
I will deny thee nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is not a boon;<br>
&#8217;Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,<br>
Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,<br>
Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit<br>
To your own person: nay, when I have a suit<br>
Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,<br>
It shall be full of poise and difficult weight<br>
And fearful to be granted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I will deny thee nothing:<br>
Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,<br>
To leave me but a little to myself.</p>

ask?</p>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Think, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Think, my lord!<br>
By heaven, he echoes me,<br>
As if there were some monster in his thought<br>
Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:<br>
I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,<br>
When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?<br>
And when I told thee he was of my counsel<br>
In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst
&#8216;Indeed!&#8217;<br>
And didst contract and purse thy brow together,<br>
As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain<br>
Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,<br>
Show me thy thought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you know I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I think thou dost;<br>
And, for I know thou&#8217;rt full of love and honesty,<br>
And weigh&#8217;st thy words before thou givest them breath,<br>
Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:<br>
For such things in a false disloyal knave<br>
Are tricks of custom, but in a man that&#8217;s just<br>
They are close delations, working from the heart<br>
That passion cannot rule.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">For Michael Cassio,<br>
I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I think so too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Men should be what they seem;<br>
Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Certain, men should be what they seem.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I think Cassio&#8217;s an honest
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, yet there&#8217;s more in this:<br>
I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,<br>
As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts<br>
The worst of words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, pardon me:<br>
Though I am bound to every act of duty,<br>
I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.<br>
Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;<br>
As where&#8217;s that palace whereinto foul things<br>
Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,<br>
But some uncleanly apprehensions<br>
Keep leets and law-days and in session sit<br>
With meditations lawful?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,<br>
If thou but think&#8217;st him wrong&#8217;d and makest his ear<br>
A stranger to thy thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you&#8212;<br>
Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,<br>
As, I confess, it is my nature&#8217;s plague<br>
To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy<br>
Shapes faults that are not&#8212;that your wisdom yet,<br>
From one that so imperfectly conceits,<br>
Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble<br>
Out of his scattering and unsure observance.<br>
It were not for your quiet nor your good,<br>
Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,<br>
To let you know my thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,<br>
Is the immediate jewel of their souls:<br>
Who steals my purse steals trash; &#8217;tis something,
nothing;<br>
&#8217;Twas mine, &#8217;tis his, and has been slave to
thousands:<br>
But he that filches from me my good name<br>
Robs me of that which not enriches him<br>
And makes me poor indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I&#8217;ll know thy thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;<br>
Nor shall not, whilst &#8217;tis in my custody.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;<br>
It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock<br>
The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss<br>
Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;<br>
But, O, what damned minutes tells he o&#8217;er<br>
Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O misery!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Poor and content is rich and rich enough,<br>
But riches fineless is as poor as winter<br>
To him that ever fears he shall be poor.<br>
Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend<br>
From jealousy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, why is this?<br>
Think&#8217;st thou I&#8217;ld make a lie of jealousy,<br>
To follow still the changes of the moon<br>
With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt<br>
Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,<br>
When I shall turn the business of my soul<br>
To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,<br>
Matching thy inference. &#8217;Tis not to make me jealous<br>
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,<br>
Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;<br>
Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:<br>
Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw<br>
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;<br>
For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;<br>
I&#8217;ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;<br>
And on the proof, there is no more but this,&#8212;<br>
Away at once with love or jealousy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason<br>
To show the love and duty that I bear you<br>
With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,<br>
Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.<br>
Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;<br>
Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:<br>
I would not have your free and noble nature,<br>
Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to&#8217;t:<br>
I know our country disposition well;<br>
In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks<br>
They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience<br>
Is not to leave&#8217;t undone, but keep&#8217;t unknown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou say so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">She did deceive her father, marrying you;<br>
And when she seem&#8217;d to shake and fear your looks,<br>
She loved them most.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">And so she did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, go to then;<br>
She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,<br>
To seal her father&#8217;s eyes up close as oak-<br>
He thought &#8217;twas witchcraft&#8212;but I am much to blame;<br>
I humbly do beseech you of your pardon<br>
For too much loving you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I am bound to thee for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I see this hath a little dash&#8217;d your
spirits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Not a jot, not a jot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, I fear it has.<br>
I hope you will consider what is spoke<br>
Comes from my love. But I do see you&#8217;re moved:<br>
I am to pray you not to strain my speech<br>
To grosser issues nor to larger reach<br>
Than to suspicion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I will not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Should you do so, my lord,<br>
My speech should fall into such vile success<br>
As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio&#8217;s my worthy
friend&#8212;<br>
My lord, I see you&#8217;re moved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">No, not much moved:<br>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there&#8217;s the point: as&#8212;to be bold

Not to affect many proposed matches<br>
Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,<br>
Whereto we see in all things nature tends&#8212;<br>
Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,<br>
Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.<br>
But pardon me; I do not in position<br>
Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear<br>
Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,<br>
May fall to match you with her country forms<br>
And happily repent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, farewell:<br>
If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;<br>
Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Going]</span> My lord, I
take my leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Why did I marry? This honest creature
doubtless<br>
Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Returning]</span> My lord, I
would I might entreat
your honour<br>
To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:<br>
Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,<br>
For sure, he fills it up with great ability,<br>
Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,<br>
You shall by that perceive him and his means:<br>
Note, if your lady strain his entertainment<br>
With any strong or vehement importunity;<br>
Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,<br>
Let me be thought too busy in my fears&#8212;<br>
As worthy cause I have to fear I am&#8212;<br>
And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Fear not my government.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow&#8217;s of exceeding honesty,<br>
And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,<br>
Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,<br>
Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,<br>
I&#8217;ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,<br>
To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black<br>
And have not those soft parts of conversation<br>
That chamberers have, or for I am declined<br>
Into the vale of years,&#8212;yet that&#8217;s not much&#8212;<br>
She&#8217;s gone. I am abused; and my relief<br>
Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,<br>
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,<br>
And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,<br>
And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,<br>
Than keep a corner in the thing I love<br>
For others&#8217; uses. Yet, &#8217;tis the plague of great
ones;<br>
Prerogatived are they less than the base;<br>
&#8217;Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:<br>
Even then this forked plague is fated to us<br>
When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Desdemona and
Emilia</span></p>
<p class="speech">If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!<br>
I&#8217;ll not believe&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my dear Othello!<br>
Your dinner, and the generous islanders<br>
By you invited, do attend your presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I am to blame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why do you speak so faintly?<br>
Are you not well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I have a pain upon my forehead here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, that&#8217;s with watching;
&#8217;twill away again:<br>
Let me but bind it hard, within this hour<br>
It will be well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Your napkin is too little:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He puts the handkerchief from
him; and it drops</span></p>
<p class="speech">Let it alone. Come, I&#8217;ll go in with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I am very sorry that you are not well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello and
Desdemona</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad I have found this napkin:<br>
This was her first remembrance from the Moor:<br>
My wayward husband hath a hundred times<br>
Woo&#8217;d me to steal it; but she so loves the token,<br>
For he conjured her she should ever keep it,<br>
That she reserves it evermore about her<br>
To kiss and talk to. I&#8217;ll have the work ta&#8217;en out,<br>
And give&#8217;t Iago: what he will do with it<br>
Heaven knows, not I;<br>
I nothing but to please his fantasy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what do you here alone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">A thing for me? it is a common thing&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">To have a foolish wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">O, is that all? What will you give me now<br>
For the same handkerchief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What handkerchief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">What handkerchief?<br>
Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;<br>
That which so often you did bid me steal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Hast stol&#8217;n it from her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">No, &#8217;faith; she let it drop by
negligence.<br>
And, to the advantage, I, being here, took&#8217;t up.<br>
Look, here it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A good wench; give it me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">What will you do with &#8217;t, that you have
been
so earnest
To have me filch it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Snatching it]</span> Why,
what&#8217;s that to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">If it be not for some purpose of import,<br>
Give&#8217;t me again: poor lady, she&#8217;ll run mad<br>
When she shall lack it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Be not acknown on &#8217;t; I have use for
it.<br>
Go, leave me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Emilia</span></p>
<p class="speech">I will in Cassio&#8217;s lodging lose this
napkin,<br>
And let him find it. Trifles light as air<br>
Are to the jealous confirmations strong<br>
As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.<br>
The Moor already changes with my poison:<br>
Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.<br>
Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,<br>
But with a little act upon the blood.<br>
Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:<br>
Look, where he comes!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Othello</span></p>
<p class="speech">Not poppy, nor mandragora,<br>
Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,<br>
Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep<br>
Which thou owedst yesterday.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! ha! false to me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, general! no more of that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the
rack:<br>
I swear &#8217;tis better to be much abused<br>
Than but to know&#8217;t a little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What sense had I of her stol&#8217;n hours of
lust?<br>
I saw&#8217;t not, thought it not, it harm&#8217;d not me:<br>
I slept the next night well, was free and merry;<br>
I found not Cassio&#8217;s kisses on her lips:<br>
He that is robb&#8217;d, not wanting what is stol&#8217;n,<br>
Let him not know&#8217;t, and he&#8217;s not robb&#8217;d at
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry to hear this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I had been happy, if the general camp,<br>
Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,<br>
So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever<br>
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!<br>
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,<br>
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!<br>
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,<br>
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,<br>
The royal banner, and all quality,<br>
Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!<br>
And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats<br>
The immortal Jove&#8217;s dead clamours counterfeit,<br>
Farewell! Othello&#8217;s occupation&#8217;s gone!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,<br>
Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:<br>
Or by the worth of man&#8217;s eternal soul,<br>
Thou hadst been better have been born a dog<br>
Than answer my waked wrath!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t come to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Make me to see&#8217;t; or, at the least, so
prove it,<br>
That the probation bear no hinge nor loop<br>
To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">My noble lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">If thou dost slander her and torture me,<br>
Never pray more; abandon all remorse;<br>
On horror&#8217;s head horrors accumulate;<br>
Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;<br>
For nothing canst thou to damnation add<br>
Greater than that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O grace! O heaven forgive me!<br>
Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?<br>
God be wi&#8217; you; take mine office. O wretched fool.<br>
That livest to make thine honesty a vice!<br>
O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,<br>
To be direct and honest is not safe.<br>
I thank you for this profit; and from hence<br>
I&#8217;ll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I should be wise, for honesty&#8217;s a fool<br>
And loses that it works for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">By the world,<br>
I think my wife be honest and think she is not;<br>
I think that thou art just and think thou art not.<br>
I&#8217;ll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh<br>
As Dian&#8217;s visage, is now begrimed and black<br>
As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,<br>
Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,<br>
I&#8217;ll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:<br>
I do repent me that I put it to you.<br>
You would be satisfied?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Would! nay, I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?<br>
Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on&#8212;<br>
Behold her topp&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Death and damnation! O!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">It were a tedious difficulty, I think,<br>
To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,<br>
If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster<br>
More than their own! What then? how then?<br>
What shall I say? Where&#8217;s satisfaction?<br>
It is impossible you should see this,<br>
Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,<br>
As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross<br>
As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,<br>
If imputation and strong circumstances,<br>
Which lead directly to the door of truth,<br>
Will give you satisfaction, you may have&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Give me a living reason she&#8217;s disloyal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I do not like the office:<br>
But, sith I am enter&#8217;d in this cause so far,<br>
Prick&#8217;d to&#8217;t by foolish honesty and love,<br>
I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;<br>
And, being troubled with a raging tooth,<br>
I could not sleep.<br>
There are a kind of men so loose of soul,<br>
That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:<br>
One of this kind is Cassio:<br>
In sleep I heard him say &#8216;sweet Desdemona,<br>
Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;&#8217;<br>
And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,<br>
Cry &#8216;O sweet creature!&#8217; and then kiss me hard,<br>
As if he pluck&#8217;d up kisses by the roots<br>
That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg<br>
Over my thigh, and sigh&#8217;d, and kiss&#8217;d; and then<br>
Cried &#8216;Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous! monstrous!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, this was but his dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">But this denoted a foregone conclusion:<br>
&#8217;Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And this may help to thicken other proofs<br>
That do demonstrate thinly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tear her all to pieces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;<br>
She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,<br>
Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief<br>
Spotted with strawberries in your wife&#8217;s hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I gave her such a one; &#8217;twas my first
gift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I know not that; but such a
handkerchief&#8212;<br>
I am sure it was your wife&#8217;s&#8212;did I to-day<br>
See Cassio wipe his beard with.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">If it be that&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">If it be that, or any that was hers,<br>
It speaks against her with the other proofs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!<br>
One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.<br>
Now do I see &#8217;tis true. Look here, Iago;<br>
All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.<br>
&#8217;Tis gone.<br>
Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!<br>
Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne<br>
To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,<br>
For &#8217;tis of aspics&#8217; tongues!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Yet be content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O, blood, blood, blood!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may
change.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,<br>
Whose icy current and compulsive course<br>
Ne&#8217;er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on<br>
To the Propontic and the Hellespont,<br>
Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,<br>
Shall ne&#8217;er look back, ne&#8217;er ebb to humble love,<br>
Till that a capable and wide revenge<br>
Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels</span></p>
<p class="speech">In the due reverence of a sacred vow<br>
I here engage my words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Do not rise yet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels</span></p>
<p class="speech">Witness, you ever-burning lights above,<br>
You elements that clip us round about,<br>
Witness that here Iago doth give up<br>
The execution of his wit, hands, heart,<br>
To wrong&#8217;d Othello&#8217;s service! Let him command,<br>
And to obey shall be in me remorse,<br>
What bloody business ever.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They rise</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I greet thy love,<br>
Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,<br>
And will upon the instant put thee to&#8217;t:<br>
Within these three days let me hear thee say<br>
That Cassio&#8217;s not alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">My friend is dead; &#8217;tis done at your
request:<br>
But let her live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!<br>
Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,<br>
To furnish me with some swift means of death<br>
For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>

<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio

<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I dare not say he lies any where.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a soldier, and for one to say a

is stabbing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Go to: where lodges he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where
I lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Can any thing be made of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise
a
lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
to lie in mine own throat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Can you inquire him out, and be edified by
report?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I will catechise the world for him; that is,
make
questions, and by them answer.</p>

have
moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>

<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse<br>
Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor<br>
Is true of mind and made of no such baseness<br>
As jealous creatures are, it were enough<br>
To put him to ill thinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Is he not jealous?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Who, he? I think the sun where he was born<br>
Drew all such humours from him.</p>

How do you, Desdemona?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:<br>
Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires<br>
A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,<br>
Much castigation, exercise devout;<br>
For here&#8217;s a young and sweating devil here,<br>
That commonly rebels. &#8217;Tis a good hand,<br>
A frank one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You may, indeed, say so;<br>
For &#8217;twas that hand that gave away my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;<br>
But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot speak of this. Come now, your
promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What promise, chuck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, indeed, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">That is a fault.<br>
That handkerchief<br>
Did an Egyptian to my mother give;<br>
She was a charmer, and could almost read<br>
The thoughts of people: she told her, while
she kept it,<br>
&#8217;Twould make her amiable and subdue my father<br>
Entirely to her love, but if she lost it<br>
Or made gift of it, my father&#8217;s eye<br>
Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt<br>
After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;<br>
And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,<br>
To give it her. I did so: and take heed on&#8217;t;<br>
Make it a darling like your precious eye;<br>
To lose&#8217;t or give&#8217;t away were such perdition<br>
As nothing else could match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true: there&#8217;s magic in the web
of it:<br>
A sibyl, that had number&#8217;d in the world<br>
The sun to course two hundred compasses,<br>
In her prophetic fury sew&#8217;d the work;<br>
The worms were hallow&#8217;d that did breed the silk;<br>
And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful<br>
Conserved of maidens&#8217; hearts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed! is&#8217;t true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Most veritable; therefore look to&#8217;t
well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Then would to God that I had never
seen&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t lost? is&#8217;t gone? speak, is it
out
o&#8217; the way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven bless us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">It is not lost; but what an if it were?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">How!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I say, it is not lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch&#8217;t, let me see&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.<br>
This is a trick to put me from my suit:<br>
Pray you, let Cassio be received again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come;<br>
You&#8217;ll never meet a more sufficient man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">The handkerchief!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I pray, talk me of Cassio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">The handkerchief!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A man that all his time<br>
Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,<br>
Shared dangers with you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">The handkerchief!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">In sooth, you are to blame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Away!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this man jealous?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I ne&#8217;er saw this before.<br>
Sure, there&#8217;s some wonder in this handkerchief:<br>
I am most unhappy in the loss of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not a year or two shows us a man:<br>
They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;<br>
To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,<br>
They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassio and
Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">There is no other way; &#8217;tis she must
do&#8217;t:<br>
And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">How now, good Cassio! what&#8217;s the news with
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you<br>
That by your virtuous means I may again<br>
Exist, and be a member of his love<br>
Whom I with all the office of my heart<br>
Entirely honour: I would not be delay&#8217;d.<br>
If my offence be of such mortal kind<br>
That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,<br>
Nor purposed merit in futurity,<br>
Can ransom me into his love again,<br>
But to know so must be my benefit;<br>
So shall I clothe me in a forced content,<br>
And shut myself up in some other course,<br>
To fortune&#8217;s alms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!<br>
My advocation is not now in tune;<br>
My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,<br>
Were he in favour as in humour alter&#8217;d.<br>
So help me every spirit sanctified,<br>
As I have spoken for you all my best<br>
And stood within the blank of his displeasure<br>
For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:<br>
What I can do I will; and more I will<br>
Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Is my lord angry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He went hence but now,<br>
And certainly in strange unquietness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,<br>
When it hath blown his ranks into the air,<br>
And, like the devil, from his very arm<br>
Puff&#8217;d his own brother:&#8212;and can he be angry?<br>
Something of moment then: I will go meet him:<br>
There&#8217;s matter in&#8217;t indeed, if he be angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, do so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Iago</span></p>
<p class="speech">Something, sure, of state,<br>
Either from Venice, or some unhatch&#8217;d practise<br>
Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,<br>
Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases<br>
Men&#8217;s natures wrangle with inferior things,<br>
Though great ones are their object. &#8217;Tis even so;<br>
For let our finger ache, and it indues<br>
Our other healthful members even to that sense<br>
Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,<br>
Nor of them look for such observances<br>
As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,<br>
I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,<br>
Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;<br>
But now I find I had suborn&#8217;d the witness,<br>
And he&#8217;s indicted falsely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you
think,<br>
And no conception nor no jealous toy<br>
Concerning you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Alas the day! I never gave him cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">But jealous souls will not be answer&#8217;d
so;<br>
They are not ever jealous for the cause,<br>
But jealous for they are jealous: &#8217;tis a monster<br>
Begot upon itself, born on itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven keep that monster from Othello&#8217;s
mind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:<br>
If I do find him fit, I&#8217;ll move your suit<br>
And seek to effect it to my uttermost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly thank your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Desdemona and
Emilia</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Save you, friend Cassio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">What make you from home?<br>
How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?<br>
I&#8217; faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.<br>
What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?<br>
Eight score eight hours? and lovers&#8217; absent hours,<br>
More tedious than the dial eight score times?<br>
O weary reckoning!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Pardon me, Bianca:<br>
I have this while with leaden thoughts been press&#8217;d:<br>
But I shall, in a more continuate time,<br>
Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving her Desdemona&#8217;s
handkerchief</span></p>
<p class="speech">Take me this work out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">O Cassio, whence came this?<br>
This is some token from a newer friend:<br>
To the felt absence now I feel a cause:<br>
Is&#8217;t come to this? Well, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, woman!<br>
Throw your vile guesses in the devil&#8217;s teeth,<br>
From whence you have them. You are jealous now<br>
That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:<br>
No, in good troth, Bianca.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, whose is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.<br>
I like the work well: ere it be demanded&#8212;<br>
As like enough it will&#8212;I&#8217;ld have it copied:<br>
Take it, and do&#8217;t; and leave me for this time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Leave you! wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I do attend here on the general;<br>
And think it no addition, nor my wish,<br>
To have him see me woman&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Not that I love you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">But that you do not love me.<br>
I pray you, bring me on the way a little,<br>
And say if I shall see you soon at night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis but a little way that I can bring
you;<br>
For I attend here: but I&#8217;ll see you soon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very good; I must be
circumstanced.</p>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Will you think so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Think so, Iago!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What,<br>
To kiss in private?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">An unauthorized kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Or to be naked with her friend in bed<br>
An hour or more, not meaning any harm?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!<br>
It is hypocrisy against the devil:<br>
They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,<br>
The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">So they do nothing, &#8217;tis a venial slip:<br>
But if I give my wife a handkerchief,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, &#8217;tis hers, my lord; and, being
hers,<br>
She may, I think, bestow&#8217;t on any man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">She is protectress of her honour too:<br>
May she give that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Her honour is an essence that&#8217;s not
seen;<br>
They have it very oft that have it not:<br>
But, for the handkerchief,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot
it.<br>
Thou said&#8217;st, it comes o&#8217;er my memory,<br>
As doth the raven o&#8217;er the infected house,<br>
Boding to all&#8212;he had my handkerchief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, what of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That&#8217;s not so good now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What,<br>
If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?<br>
Or heard him say,&#8212;as knaves be such abroad,<br>
Who having, by their own importunate suit,<br>
Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,<br>
Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose<br>
But they must blab&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he said any thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,<br>
No more than he&#8217;ll unswear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What hath he said?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, that he did&#8212;I know not what
he did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What? what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Lie&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;With her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">With her, on her; what you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her,
when
they belie her. Lie with her! that&#8217;s fulsome.
&#8212;Handkerchief&#8212;confessions&#8212;handkerchief!&#8212;To

confess, and be hanged for his labour;&#8212;first, to be
hanged, and then to confess.&#8212;I tremble at it.
Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
passion without some instruction. It is not words
that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
&#8212;Is&#8217;t
possible?&#8212;Confess&#8212;handkerchief!&#8212;O
devil!&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Falls in a trance</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>

My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;<br>
And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,<br>
All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!<br>
My lord, I say! Othello!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Cassio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">My lord is fall&#8217;n into an epilepsy:<br>
This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Rub him about the temples.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">No, forbear;<br>
The lethargy must have his quiet course:<br>
If not, he foams at mouth and by and by<br>
Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:<br>
Do you withdraw yourself a little while,<br>
He will recover straight: when he is gone,<br>
I would on great occasion speak with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speech">How is it, general? have you not hurt your
head?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou mock me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I mock you! no, by heaven.<br>
Would you would bear your fortune like a man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">A horned man&#8217;s a monster and a beast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s many a beast then in a populous
city,<br>
And many a civil monster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Did he confess it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Good sir, be a man;<br>
Think every bearded fellow that&#8217;s but yoked<br>
May draw with you: there&#8217;s millions now alive<br>
That nightly lie in those unproper beds<br>
Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.<br>
O, &#8217;tis the spite of hell, the fiend&#8217;s arch-mock,<br>
To lip a wanton in a secure couch,<br>
And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;<br>
And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou art wise; &#8217;tis certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Stand you awhile apart;<br>
Confine yourself but in a patient list.<br>
Whilst you were here o&#8217;erwhelmed with your grief&#8212;<br>
A passion most unsuiting such a man&#8212;<br>
Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,<br>
And laid good &#8217;scuse upon your ecstasy,<br>
Bade him anon return and here speak with me;<br>
The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,<br>
And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,<br>
That dwell in every region of his face;<br>
For I will make him tell the tale anew,<br>
Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when<br>
He hath, and is again to cope your wife:<br>
I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;<br>
Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,<br>
And nothing of a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou hear, Iago?<br>
I will be found most cunning in my patience;<br>
But&#8212;dost thou hear?&#8212;most bloody.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not amiss;<br>
But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Othello retires</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,<br>
A housewife that by selling her desires<br>
Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature<br>
That dotes on Cassio; as &#8217;tis the strumpet&#8217;s plague<br>
To beguile many and be beguiled by one:<br>
He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain<br>
From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speech">As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;<br>
And his unbookish jealousy must construe<br>
Poor Cassio&#8217;s smiles, gestures and light behavior,<br>
Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">The worser that you give me the addition<br>
Whose want even kills me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure
on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Speaking lower</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, if this suit lay in Bianco&#8217;s
power,<br>
How quickly should you speed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor caitiff!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how he laughs already!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I never knew woman love man so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor rogue! I think, i&#8217; faith, she
loves me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear, Cassio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Now he importunes him<br>
To tell it o&#8217;er: go to; well said, well said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">She gives it out that you shall marry hey:<br>
Do you intend it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear
some
charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, say true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I am a very villain else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Have you scored me? Well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">This is the monkey&#8217;s own giving out: she
is
persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
flattery, not out of my promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She was here even now; she haunts me in every
place.
I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Crying &#8216;O dear Cassio!&#8217; as it were:
his gesture
imports it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so
hales,
and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber.
O,
I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
throw it to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I must leave her company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Before me! look, where she comes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed
one.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speech">What do you mean by this haunting of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did
you
mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
work?&#8212;A likely piece of work, that you should find
it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
This is some minx&#8217;s token, and I must take out the
work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
you had it, I&#8217;ll take out no work on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">An you&#8217;ll come to supper to-night, you may;
an you
will not, come when you are next prepared for.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">After her, after her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, I must; she&#8217;ll rail in the

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Will you sup there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, I intend so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very
fain
speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, come; will you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; say no more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Cassio</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Roderigo</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I do not find that thou dealest justly with
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What in the contrary?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Every day thou daffest me with some device,
Iago;
and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
already I have foolishly suffered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hear me, Roderigo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, I have heard too much, for your
words and
performances are no kin together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You charge me most unjustly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out
of
my means. The jewels you have had from me to
deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
votarist: you have told me she hath received them
and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
respect and acquaintance, but I find none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Well; go to; very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor
&#8217;tis
not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
to find myself fobbed in it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you &#8217;tis not very well. I will make
myself
known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
will seek satisfaction of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You have said now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and said nothing but what I protest
intendment of doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, now I see there&#8217;s mettle in thee, and
even from
this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">It hath not appeared.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
take me from this world with treachery and devise
engines for my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what is it? is it within reason and
compass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, there is especial commission come from
Venice
to depute Cassio in Othello&#8217;s place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
return again to Venice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away
with
him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
so determinate as the removing of Cassio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">How do you mean, removing of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, by making him uncapable of Othello&#8217;s
place;
knocking out his brains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">And that you would have me to do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a
right.
He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
to waste: about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I will hear further reason for this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And you shall be satisfied.</p>

She was in love, and he she loved proved mad<br>
And did forsake her: she had a song of &#8216;willow;&#8217;<br>

And she died singing it: that song to-night<br>

<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the

<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">In troth, I think I should; and undo&#8217;t when
I had
done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
exhibition; but for the whole world,&#8212;why, who would
not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
monarch? I should venture purgatory for&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong<br>
For the whole world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Why the wrong is but a wrong i&#8217; the world:
and
having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
own world, and you might quickly make it right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I do not think there is any such woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as
would
store the world they played for.<br>
But I do think it is their husbands&#8217; faults<br>
If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,<br>
And pour our treasures into foreign laps,<br>
Or else break out in peevish jealousies,<br>
Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,<br>
Or scant our former having in despite;<br>
Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,<br>
Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know<br>
Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell<br>
And have their palates both for sweet and sour,<br>
As husbands have. What is it that they do<br>
When they change us for others? Is it sport?<br>
I think it is: and doth affection breed it?<br>
I think it doth: is&#8217;t frailty that thus errs?<br>
It is so too: and have not we affections,<br>
Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?<br>
Then let them use us well: else let them know,<br>
The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>

the matter, husband?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Cassio hath here been set on in the dark<br>
By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:<br>
He&#8217;s almost slain, and Roderigo dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee,
Emilia,<br>
Go know of Cassio where he supp&#8217;d to-night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, do you shake at that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">He supp&#8217;d at my house; but I therefore
shake not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">I am no strumpet; but of life as honest<br>
As you that thus abuse me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">As I! foh! fie upon thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Kind gentlemen, let&#8217;s go see poor Cassio
dress&#8217;d.<br>
Come, mistress, you must tell&#8217;s another tale.<br>
Emilia run you to the citadel,<br>
And tell my lord and lady what hath happ&#8217;d.<br>
Will you go on? I pray.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. A bedchamber in the castle: Desdemona in bed
asleep;</h4>
<p class="speech">a light burning.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Othello</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">It is the cause, it is the cause, my
soul,&#8212;<br>
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!&#8212;<br>
It is the cause. Yet I&#8217;ll not shed her blood;<br>
Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,<br>
And smooth as monumental alabaster.<br>
Yet she must die, else she&#8217;ll betray more men.<br>
Put out the light, and then put out the light:<br>
If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,<br>
I can again thy former light restore,<br>
Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,<br>
Thou cunning&#8217;st pattern of excelling nature,<br>
I know not where is that Promethean heat<br>
That can thy light relume. When I have pluck&#8217;d the rose,<br>
I cannot give it vital growth again.<br>
It must needs wither: I&#8217;ll smell it on the tree.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing her</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade<br>
Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.<br>
Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,<br>
And love thee after. One more, and this the last:<br>
So sweet was ne&#8217;er so fatal. I must weep,<br>
But they are cruel tears: this sorrow&#8217;s heavenly;<br>
It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s there? Othello?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ay. Desdemona.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Will you come to bed, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Have you pray&#8217;d to-night, Desdemona?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">If you bethink yourself of any crime<br>
Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,<br>
Solicit for it straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:<br>
I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;<br>
No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Talk you of killing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Then heaven<br>
Have mercy on me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Amen, with all my heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Hum!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then<br>
When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,<br>
Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Think on thy sins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;They are loves I bear to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and for that thou diest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">That death&#8217;s unnatural that kills for
loving.<br>
Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?<br>
Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:<br>
These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,<br>
They do not point on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, and be still!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I will so. What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">That handkerchief which I so loved and gave
thee<br>
Thou gavest to Cassio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my life and soul!<br>
Send for the man, and ask him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet soul, take heed,<br>
Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but not yet to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, presently:<br>
Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;<br>
For to deny each article with oath<br>
Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception<br>
That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Then Lord have mercy on me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I say, amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">And have you mercy too! I never did<br>
Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio<br>
But with such general warranty of heaven<br>
As I might love: I never gave him token.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in&#8217;s
hand.<br>
O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,<br>
And makest me call what I intend to do<br>
A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:<br>
I saw the handkerchief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">He found it then;<br>
I never gave it him: send for him hither;<br>
Let him confess a truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">He hath confess&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">What, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">That he hath used thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">How? unlawfully?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">He will not say so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">No, his mouth is stopp&#8217;d;<br>
Honest Iago hath ta&#8217;en order for&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Had all his hairs been lives, my great
revenge<br>
Had stomach for them all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! he is betray&#8217;d and I undone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Out, strumpet! weep&#8217;st thou for him to my
face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Down, strumpet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if you strive&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">But half an hour!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Being done, there is no pause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">But while I say one prayer!</p>

<p class="speech">Yes: &#8217;tis Emilia. By and by. She&#8217;s
dead.<br>
&#8217;Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio&#8217;s
death.&#8212;<br>
The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?<br>
Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were&#8217;t
good?&#8212;<br>
I think she stirs again:&#8212;no. What&#8217;s best to do?<br>
If she come in, she&#8217;ll sure speak to my wife:<br>
My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.<br>
O insupportable! O heavy hour!<br>
Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse<br>
Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe<br>
Should yawn at alteration.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> I do beseech
you<br>
That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What, now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">But now, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">It is the very error of the moon;<br>
She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,<br>
And makes men mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Cassio, my lord, hath kill&#8217;d a young
Venetian<br>
Call&#8217;d Roderigo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>

<p class="speech">No, Cassio is not kill&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Not Cassio kill&#8217;d! then murder&#8217;s out

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">You heard her say herself, it was not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">She was false as water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art rash as fire, to say<br>
That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.<br>
O, I were damn&#8217;d beneath all depth in hell,<br>
But that I did proceed upon just grounds<br>
To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,<br>
If heaven would make me such another world<br>
Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,<br>

I say thy husband: dost understand the word?<br>
My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">If he say so, may his pernicious soul<br>

Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.<br>
And die in music.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Singing</span></p>
<p class="speech">Willow, willow, willow,&#8212;<br>
Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;<br>
So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;<br>
So speaking as I think, I die, I die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I have another weapon in this chamber;<br>
It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook&#8217;s temper:&#8212;<br>
O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> If thou
attempt it, it will cost thee dear:<br>
Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Look in upon me then and speak with me,<br>
Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Gratiano</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Behold, I have a weapon;<br>
A better never did itself sustain<br>
Upon a soldier&#8217;s thigh: I have seen the day,<br>
That, with this little arm and this good sword,<br>
I have made my way through more impediments<br>
Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!<br>
Who can control his fate? &#8217;tis not so now.<br>
Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon&#8217;d;<br>
Here is my journey&#8217;s end, here is my butt,<br>
And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.<br>
Do you go back dismay&#8217;d? &#8217;tis a lost fear;<br>
Man but a rush against Othello&#8217;s breast,<br>
And he retires. Where should Othello go?<br>
Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr&#8217;d wench!<br>
Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,<br>
This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,<br>
And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!<br>
Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!<br>
Whip me, ye devils,<br>
From the possession of this heavenly sight!<br>
Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!<br>
Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!<br>
O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!<br>
Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lodovico. Montano,
Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with Iago,
prisoner</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s he that was Othello: here I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I look down towards his feet; but that&#8217;s a
fable.<br>
If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Wounds Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">Wrench his sword from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I bleed, sir; but not kill&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I am not sorry neither: I&#8217;ld have thee
live;<br>
For, in my sense, &#8217;tis happiness to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,<br>
Fall&#8217;n in the practise of a damned slave,<br>
What shall be said to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, any thing:<br>
An honourable murderer, if you will;<br>
For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">This wretch hath part confess&#8217;d his
villany:<br>
Did you and he consent in Cassio&#8217;s death?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Dear general, I never gave you cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.<br>
Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil<br>
Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:<br>
From this time forth I never will speak word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">What, not to pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Torments will ope your lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou dost best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you shall understand what hath
befall&#8217;n,<br>
Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter<br>
Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;<br>
And here another: the one of them imports<br>
The death of Cassio to be undertook<br>
By Roderigo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O villain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Most heathenish and most gross!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">Now here&#8217;s another discontented paper,<br>
Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,<br>
Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;<br>
But that belike Iago in the interim<br>
Came in and satisfied him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O the pernicious caitiff!<br>
How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief<br>
That was my wife&#8217;s?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I found it in my chamber:<br>
And he himself confess&#8217;d but even now<br>
That there he dropp&#8217;d it for a special purpose<br>
Which wrought to his desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O fool! fool! fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">There is besides in Roderigo&#8217;s letter,<br>
How he upbraids Iago, that he made him<br>
Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came<br>
That I was cast: and even but now he spake,<br>
After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,<br>
Iago set him on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">You must forsake this room, and go with us:<br>
Your power and your command is taken off,<br>
And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,<br>
If there be any cunning cruelty<br>
That can torment him much and hold him long,<br>
It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,<br>
Till that the nature of your fault be known<br>
To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Soft you; a word or two before you go.<br>
I have done the state some service, and they know&#8217;t.<br>
No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,<br>
When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,<br>
Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,<br>
Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak<br>
Of one that loved not wisely but too well;<br>
Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought<br>
Perplex&#8217;d in the extreme; of one whose hand,<br>
Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away<br>
Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,<br>
Albeit unused to the melting mood,<br>
Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees<br>
Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;<br>
And say besides, that in Aleppo once,<br>
Where a malignant and a turban&#8217;d Turk<br>
Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,<br>
I took by the throat the circumcised dog,<br>
And smote him, thus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabs himself</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech">O bloody period!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;All that&#8217;s spoke is
marr&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I kiss&#8217;d thee ere I kill&#8217;d thee: no
way but this;<br>
Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Falls on the bed, and
dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">This did I fear, but thought he had no
weapon;<br>
For he was great of heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lodovico</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Iago]</span> O Spartan
dog,<br>
More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!<br>
Look on the tragic loading of this bed;<br>
This is thy work: the object poisons sight;<br>
Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,<br>
And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,<br>
For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,<br>
Remains the censure of this hellish villain;<br>
The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!<br>
Myself will straight aboard: and to the state<br>
This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</p>
