<h4>Scene I. Duke Orsino&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Orsino, Curio, and
other Lords; Musicians attending</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">If music be the food of love, play on;<br>
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,<br>
The appetite may sicken, and so die.<br>
That strain again! it had a dying fall:<br>
O, it came o&#8217;er my ear like the sweet sound,<br>
That breathes upon a bank of violets,<br>
Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:<br>
&#8217;Tis not so sweet now as it was before.<br>
O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,<br>
That, notwithstanding thy capacity<br>
Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,<br>
Of what validity and pitch soe&#8217;er,<br>
But falls into abatement and low price,<br>
Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy<br>
That it alone is high fantastical.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curio</p>
<p class="speech">Will you go hunt, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">What, Curio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curio</p>
<p class="speech">The hart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, so I do, the noblest that I
have:<br>
O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,<br>
Methought she purged the air of pestilence!<br>
That instant was I turn&#8217;d into a hart;<br>
And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,<br>
E&#8217;er since pursue me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! what news from her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">So please my lord, I might not be admitted;<br>
But from her handmaid do return this answer:<br>
The element itself, till seven years&#8217; heat,<br>
Shall not behold her face at ample view;<br>
But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk<br>
And water once a day her chamber round<br>
With eye-offending brine: all this to season<br>
A brother&#8217;s dead love, which she would keep fresh<br>
And lasting in her sad remembrance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame<br>
To pay this debt of love but to a brother,<br>
How will she love, when the rich golden shaft<br>
Hath kill&#8217;d the flock of all affections else<br>
That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,<br>
These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill&#8217;d<br>
Her sweet perfections with one self king!<br>
Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:<br>
Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The sea-coast.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Viola, a Captain, and
Sailors</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">What country, friends, is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">This is Illyria, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">And what should I do in Illyria?<br>
My brother he is in Elysium.<br>
Perchance he is not drown&#8217;d: what think you, sailors?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">It is perchance that you yourself were saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">O my poor brother! and so perchance may he
be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,<br>
Assure yourself, after our ship did split,<br>
When you and those poor number saved with you<br>
Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,<br>
Most provident in peril, bind himself,<br>
Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,<br>
To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;<br>
Where, like Arion on the dolphin&#8217;s back,<br>
I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves<br>
So long as I could see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">For saying so, there&#8217;s gold:<br>
Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,<br>
Whereto thy speech serves for authority,<br>
The like of him. Know&#8217;st thou this country?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born<br>
Not three hours&#8217; travel from this very place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Who governs here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">A noble duke, in nature as in name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">What is the name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Orsino.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Orsino! I have heard my father name him:<br>
He was a bachelor then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">And so is now, or was so very late;<br>
For but a month ago I went from hence,<br>
And then &#8217;twas fresh in murmur,&#8212;as, you know,<br>
What great ones do the less will prattle of,&#8212;<br>
That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count<br>
That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her<br>
In the protection of his son, her brother,<br>
Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,<br>
They say, she hath abjured the company<br>
And sight of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O that I served that lady<br>
And might not be delivered to the world,<br>
Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,<br>
What my estate is!</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">That were hard to compass;<br>
Because she will admit no kind of suit,<br>
No, not the duke&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;<br>
And though that nature with a beauteous wall<br>
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee<br>
I will believe thou hast a mind that suits<br>
With this thy fair and outward character.<br>
I prithee, and I&#8217;ll pay thee bounteously,<br>
Conceal me what I am, and be my aid<br>
For such disguise as haply shall become<br>
The form of my intent. I&#8217;ll serve this duke:<br>
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:<br>
It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing<br>
And speak to him in many sorts of music<br>
That will allow me very worth his service.<br>
What else may hap to time I will commit;<br>
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Be you his eunuch, and your mute I&#8217;ll
be:<br>
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee: lead me on.</p>

<h4>Scene III. Olivia&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Toby Belch and
Maria</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">What a plague means my niece, to take the death
of
her brother thus? I am sure care&#8217;s an enemy to life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier
o&#8217;
nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
exceptions to your ill hours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Why, let her except, before excepted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but you must confine yourself within the
modest
limits of order.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Confine! I&#8217;ll confine myself no finer than
I am:
these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
themselves in their own straps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I
heard
my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s as tall a man as any&#8217;s in
Illyria.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that to the purpose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but he&#8217;ll have but a year in all these
ducats:
he&#8217;s a very fool and a prodigal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, that you&#8217;ll say so! he plays o&#8217;
the
viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
word for word without book, and hath all the good
gifts of nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides
that
he&#8217;s a fool, he&#8217;s a great quarreller: and but that
he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
hath in quarrelling, &#8217;tis thought among the prudent
he would quickly have the gift of a grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">By this hand, they are scoundrels and
subtractors
that say so of him. Who are they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">They that add, moreover, he&#8217;s drunk nightly
in your company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">With drinking healths to my niece: I&#8217;ll
drink to
her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
drink in Illyria: he&#8217;s a coward and a coystrill
that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
o&#8217; the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Andrew</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Sir Andrew!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Bless you, fair shrew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">And you too, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">My niece&#8217;s chambermaid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Good Mistress Accost, I desire better
acquaintance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">My name is Mary, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Good Mistress Mary Accost,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake, knight; &#8216;accost&#8217; is
front her, board
her, woo her, assail her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I would not undertake her in
this
company. Is that the meaning of &#8216;accost&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Fare you well, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou
mightst
never draw sword again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">An you part so, mistress, I would I might
never
draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
fools in hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I have not you by the hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, but you shall have; and here&#8217;s my
hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, &#8216;thought is free:&#8217; I pray
you, bring
your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore, sweet-heart? what&#8217;s your
metaphor?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">It&#8217;s dry, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I
can
keep my hand dry. But what&#8217;s your jest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">A dry jest, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Are you full of them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers&#8217; ends:
marry,
now I let go your hand, I am barren.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did
I
see thee so put down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Never in your life, I think; unless you see
canary
put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">No question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">An I thought that, I&#8217;ld forswear it.
I&#8217;ll ride home
to-morrow, Sir Toby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Pourquoi, my dear knight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">What is &#8216;Pourquoi&#8217;? do or not do? I
would I had
bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
followed the arts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Then hadst thou had an excellent head of
hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Why, would that have mended my hair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by
nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">But it becomes me well enough, does&#8217;t
not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and
I
hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
and spin it off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I&#8217;ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your
niece
will not be seen; or if she be, it&#8217;s four to one
she&#8217;ll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;ll none o&#8217; the count:
she&#8217;ll not match above
her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
have heard her swear&#8217;t. Tut, there&#8217;s life
in&#8217;t,
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow
o&#8217; the
strangest mind i&#8217; the world; I delight in masques
and revels sometimes altogether.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under
the
degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
with an old man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I can cut a caper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">And I can cut the mutton to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">And I think I have the back-trick simply as
strong
as any man in Illyria.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore
have
these gifts a curtain before &#8217;em? are they like to
take dust, like Mistress Mall&#8217;s picture? why dost
thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, &#8217;tis strong, and it does indifferent
well in a
flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">What shall we do else? were we not born under
Taurus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Taurus! That&#8217;s sides and heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see
the
caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!</p>

<p class="speech">On your attendance, my lord; here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st no less but all; I have unclasp&#8217;d<br>
To thee the book even of my secret soul:<br>
Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;<br>
Be not denied access, stand at her doors,<br>
And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow<br>
Till thou have audience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, my noble lord,<br>
If she be so abandon&#8217;d to her sorrow<br>
As it is spoke, she never will admit me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds<br>
Rather than make unprofited return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">O, then unfold the passion of my love,<br>
Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:<br>
It shall become thee well to act my woes;<br>
She will attend it better in thy youth<br>
Than in a nuncio&#8217;s of more grave aspect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I think not so, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Dear lad, believe it;<br>
For they shall yet belie thy happy years,<br>
That say thou art a man: Diana&#8217;s lip<br>
Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe<br>
Is as the maiden&#8217;s organ, shrill and sound,<br>
And all is semblative a woman&#8217;s part.<br>
I know thy constellation is right apt<br>
For this affair. Some four or five attend him;<br>
All, if you will; for I myself am best<br>
When least in company. Prosper well in this,<br>
And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,<br>
To call his fortunes thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll do my best<br>
To woo your lady:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">yet, a barful strife!<br>
Whoe&#8217;er I woo, myself would be his wife.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Maria and
Clown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I
will
not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in
this
world needs to fear no colours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Make that good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">He shall see none to fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where
that
saying was born, of &#8216;I fear no colours.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Where, good Mistress Mary?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in
your foolery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and
those
that are fools, let them use their talents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent;
or,
to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage;
and,
for turning away, let summer bear it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">You are resolute, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two
points.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">That if one break, the other will hold; or, if
both
break, your gaskins fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way;
if
Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
piece of Eve&#8217;s flesh as any in Illyria.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, you rogue, no more o&#8217; that. Here
comes my
lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Wit, an&#8217;t be thy will, put me into good
fooling!
Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
&#8216;Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Olivia with
Malvolio</span></p>
<p class="speech">God bless thee, lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Take the fool away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, you&#8217;re a dry fool; I&#8217;ll no
more of you:
besides, you grow dishonest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Two faults, madonna, that drink and good
counsel
will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
that&#8217;s mended is but patched: virtue that
transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
calamity, so beauty&#8217;s a flower. The lady bade take
away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I bade them take away you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus
non
facit monachum; that&#8217;s as much to say as I wear not
motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
prove you a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Can you do it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Dexterously, good madonna.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Make your proof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my
mouse
of virtue, answer me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I&#8217;ll
bide your proof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Good madonna, why mournest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Good fool, for my brother&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I think his soul is in hell, madonna.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">I know his soul is in heaven, fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your
brother&#8217;s
soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he
not mend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake
him:
infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
better fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for
the
better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
word for two pence that you are no fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">How say you to that, Malvolio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such
a
barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
than a stone. Look you now, he&#8217;s out of his guard
already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
than the fools&#8217; zanies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and
taste
with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
man, though he do nothing but reprove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
speakest well of fools!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Maria</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman
much
desires to speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">From the Count Orsino, is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">I know not, madam: &#8217;tis a fair young man,
and well attended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Who of my people hold him in delay?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing
but
madman: fie on him!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Maria</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count,
I
am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Malvolio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
and
people dislike it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy
eldest
son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
brains! for,&#8212;here he comes,&#8212;one of thy kin has a
most weak pia mater.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Toby
Belch</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the
gate, cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">A gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">A gentleman! what gentleman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a gentle man here&#8212;a plague
o&#8217; these
pickle-herring! How now, sot!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Good Sir Toby!</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by
this lethargy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Lechery! I defy lechery. There&#8217;s one at the
gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, what is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not:
give
me faith, say I. Well, it&#8217;s all one.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s a drunken man like, fool?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
him; and a third drowns him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit
o&#8217; my
coz; for he&#8217;s in the third degree of drink, he&#8217;s
drowned: go, look after him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall
look
to the madman.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Malvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak
with
you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
lady? he&#8217;s fortified against any denial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him he shall not speak with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Has been told so; and he says, he&#8217;ll stand
at your
door like a sheriff&#8217;s post, and be the supporter to
a bench, but he&#8217;ll speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What kind o&#8217; man is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, of mankind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What manner of man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Of very ill manner; he&#8217;ll speak with you,
will you or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Of what personage and years is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough
for
a boy; as a squash is before &#8217;tis a peascod, or a
cooling when &#8217;tis almost an apple: &#8217;tis with him
in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
would think his mother&#8217;s milk were scarce out of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlewoman, my lady calls.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Give me my veil: come, throw it o&#8217;er my
face.<br>
We&#8217;ll once more hear Orsino&#8217;s embassy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Viola, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">The honourable lady of the house, which is
she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Speak to me; I shall answer for her.<br>
Your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable
beauty,&#8212;I
pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
comptible, even to the least sinister usage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Whence came you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I can say little more than I have studied, and
that
question&#8217;s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
that I may proceed in my speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Are you a comedian?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very
fangs
of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
the lady of the house?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">If I do not usurp myself, I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
the heart of my message.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Come to what is important in&#8217;t: I forgive
you the praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, I took great pains to study it, and
&#8217;tis poetical.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">It is the more like to be feigned: I pray
you,
keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
you have reason, be brief: &#8217;tis not that time of
moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver,
when
the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture
of
war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
divinity, to any other&#8217;s, profanation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Give us the place alone: we will hear this
divinity.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Maria and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, what is your text?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Most sweet lady,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of
it.<br>
Where lies your text?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">In Orsino&#8217;s bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">To answer by the method, in the first of his
heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more
to say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Good madam, let me see your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Have you any commission from your lord to
negotiate
with my face? You are now out of your text: but
we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is&#8217;t
not well done?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Unveiling</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Excellently done, if God did all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis in grain, sir; &#8217;twill endure
wind and weather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and
white<br>
Nature&#8217;s own sweet and cunning hand laid on:<br>
Lady, you are the cruell&#8217;st she alive,<br>
If you will lead these graces to the grave<br>
And leave the world no copy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will
give
out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
inventoried, and every particle and utensil
labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
you sent hither to praise me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I see you what you are, you are too proud;<br>
But, if you were the devil, you are fair.<br>
My lord and master loves you: O, such love<br>
Could be but recompensed, though you were crown&#8217;d<br>
The nonpareil of beauty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">How does he love me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">With adorations, fertile tears,<br>
With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love
him:<br>
Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,<br>
Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;<br>
In voices well divulged, free, learn&#8217;d and valiant;<br>
And in dimension and the shape of nature<br>
A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;<br>
He might have took his answer long ago.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">If I did love you in my master&#8217;s flame,<br>
With such a suffering, such a deadly life,<br>
In your denial I would find no sense;<br>
I would not understand it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what would you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Make me a willow cabin at your gate,<br>
And call upon my soul within the house;<br>
Write loyal cantons of contemned love<br>
And sing them loud even in the dead of night;<br>
Halloo your name to the reverberate hills<br>
And make the babbling gossip of the air<br>
Cry out &#8216;Olivia!&#8217; O, You should not rest<br>
Between the elements of air and earth,<br>
But you should pity me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">You might do much.<br>
What is your parentage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:<br>
I am a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Get you to your lord;<br>
I cannot love him: let him send no more;<br>
Unless, perchance, you come to me again,<br>
To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:<br>
I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I am no fee&#8217;d post, lady; keep your
purse:<br>
My master, not myself, lacks recompense.<br>
Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;<br>
And let your fervor, like my master&#8217;s, be<br>
Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.</p>

Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,<br>
Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
soft, soft!<br>
Unless the master were the man. How now!<br>
Even so quickly may one catch the plague?<br>
Methinks I feel this youth&#8217;s perfections<br>

<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I
go with you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly
over
me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
Antonio: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
me in manners the rather to express myself. You
must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
which I called Roderigo. My father was that
Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
for some hour before you took me from the breach of
the sea was my sister drowned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas the day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A lady, sir, though it was said she much
resembled
me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
though I could not with such estimable wonder
overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">If you will not murder me for my love, let me
be
your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">If you will not undo what you have done, that
is,
kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino&#8217;s court:
farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!<br>
I have many enemies in Orsino&#8217;s court,<br>
Else would I very shortly see thee there.<br>
But, come what may, I do adore thee so,<br>
That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.</p>

have
saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
your lord&#8217;s taking of this. Receive it so.</p>

For she did speak in starts distractedly.<br>
She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion<br>
Invites me in this churlish messenger.<br>
None of my lord&#8217;s ring! why, he sent her none.<br>
I am the man: if it be so, as &#8217;tis,<br>

How easy is it for the proper-false<br>

Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!<br>
For such as we are made of, such we be.<br>
How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;<br>
And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;<br>
And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.<br>
What will become of this? As I am man,<br>
My state is desperate for my master&#8217;s love;<br>
As I am woman,&#8212;now alas the day!&#8212;<br>

To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is

constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
that cons state without book and utters it by great
swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so

his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
notable cause to work.</p>

<p class="speech">What wilt thou do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">I will drop in his way some obscure epistles
of
love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
himself most feelingly personated. I can write very

My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:<br>
A thousand thousand sighs to save,<br>
Lay me, O, where<br>
Sad true lover never find my grave,<br>
To weep there!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s for thy pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing,
sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll pay thy pleasure then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time
or another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Give me now leave to leave thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
constancy put to sea, that their business might be
every thing and their intent every where; for that&#8217;s
it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Let all the rest give place.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Curio and Attendants
retire</span></p>
<p class="speech">Once more, Cesario,<br>
Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:<br>
Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,<br>
Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;<br>
The parts that fortune hath bestow&#8217;d upon her,<br>
Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;<br>
But &#8217;tis that miracle and queen of gems<br>
That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">But if she cannot love you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot be so answer&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Sooth, but you must.<br>
Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,<br>
Hath for your love a great a pang of heart<br>
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;<br>
You tell her so; must she not then be answer&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">There is no woman&#8217;s sides<br>
Can bide the beating of so strong a passion<br>
As love doth give my heart; no woman&#8217;s heart<br>
So big, to hold so much; they lack retention<br>
Alas, their love may be call&#8217;d appetite,<br>
No motion of the liver, but the palate,<br>
That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;<br>
But mine is all as hungry as the sea,<br>
And can digest as much: make no compare<br>
Between that love a woman can bear me<br>
And that I owe Olivia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but I know&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Too well what love women to men may owe:<br>
In faith, they are as true of heart as we.<br>
My father had a daughter loved a man,<br>
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,<br>
I should your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">And what&#8217;s her history?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">A blank, my lord. She never told her love,<br>
But let concealment, like a worm i&#8217; the bud,<br>
Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,<br>
And with a green and yellow melancholy<br>
She sat like patience on a monument,<br>
Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?<br>
We men may say more, swear more: but indeed<br>
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove<br>
Much in our vows, but little in our love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">But died thy sister of her love, my boy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I am all the daughters of my father&#8217;s
house,<br>
And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.<br>
Sir, shall I to this lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that&#8217;s the theme.<br>
To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,<br>
My love can give no place, bide no denay.</p>

<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Get ye all three into the box-tree:
Malvolio&#8217;s
coming down this walk: he has been yonder i&#8217; the
sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half

know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,</p>

once told
me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one

exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
What should I think on&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s an overweening rogue!</p>

<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;I may command where I adore.&#8217; Why,
she may command
me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
evident to any formal capacity; there is no
obstruction in this: and the end,&#8212;what should
that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
that resemble something in me,&#8212;Softly! M, O, A,
I,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or I&#8217;ll cudgel him, and make him cry

<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might

<p class="speech">&#8216;If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my
stars I
am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
have greatness thrust upon &#8217;em. Thy Fates open
their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
not worthy to touch Fortune&#8217;s fingers. Farewell.<br>
She that would alter services with thee,<br>
The Fortunate-Unhappy.&#8217;
<p class="speech">Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a

unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him

but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
wrong side may be turned outward!</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s certain; they that dally nicely

<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, her name&#8217;s a word; and to dally

<p class="speech">Thy reason, man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>

words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
reason with them.</p>

nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in
my

to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Art not thou the Lady Olivia&#8217;s fool?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly:
she
will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
herrings; the husband&#8217;s the bigger: I am indeed not
her fool, but her corrupter of words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I saw thee late at the Count Orsino&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the

the fool should be as oft with your master as with
my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.</p>

<p class="speaker">Viola</p>

begged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging
but
a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
within, sir. I will construe to them whence you

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Will you encounter the house? my niece is
desirous
you should enter, if your trade be to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is
the

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>

odours on you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>

odours;&#8217; well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">My matter hath no voice, to your own most

<p class="speech">&#8216;Odours,&#8217; &#8216;pregnant&#8217; and
&#8216;vouchsafed:&#8217; I&#8217;ll get &#8217;em
all three all ready.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Sir Toby Belch, Sir

<p class="speech">Give me your hand, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">My duty, madam, and most humble service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What is your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Cesario is your servant&#8217;s name, fair
princess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">My servant, sir! &#8217;Twas never merry
world<br>
Since lowly feigning was call&#8217;d compliment:<br>
You&#8217;re servant to the Count Orsino, youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:<br>
Your servant&#8217;s servant is your servant, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">For him, I think not on him: for his
thoughts,<br>
Would they were blanks, rather than fill&#8217;d with me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts<br>
On his behalf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, by your leave, I pray you,<br>
I bade you never speak again of him:<br>
But, would you undertake another suit,<br>
I had rather hear you to solicit that<br>
Than music from the spheres.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Dear lady,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,<br>
After the last enchantment you did here,<br>
A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse<br>
Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:<br>
Under your hard construction must I sit,<br>
To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,<br>
Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?<br>
Have you not set mine honour at the stake<br>
And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts<br>
That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving<br>
Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,<br>
Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I pity you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That&#8217;s a degree to love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a grize; for &#8217;tis a vulgar
proof,<br>
That very oft we pity enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, methinks &#8217;tis time to smile
again.<br>
O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!<br>
If one should be a prey, how much the better<br>
To fall before the lion than the wolf!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clock strikes</span></p>
<p class="speech">The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.<br>
Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:<br>
And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,<br>
Your were is alike to reap a proper man:<br>
There lies your way, due west.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition<br>
Attend your ladyship!<br>
You&#8217;ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Stay:<br>
I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">That you do think you are not what you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">If I think so, I think the same of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Then think you right: I am not what I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">I would you were as I would have you be!</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Would it be better, madam, than I am?<br>
I wish it might, for now I am your fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful<br>
In the contempt and anger of his lip!<br>
A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon<br>
Than love that would seem hid: love&#8217;s night is noon.<br>
Cesario, by the roses of the spring,<br>
By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,<br>
I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,<br>
Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.<br>
Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,<br>
For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,<br>
But rather reason thus with reason fetter,<br>
Love sought is good, but given unsought better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">By innocence I swear, and by my youth<br>
I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,<br>
And that no woman has; nor never none<br>
Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.<br>
And so adieu, good madam: never more<br>
Will I my master&#8217;s tears to you deplore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move<br>
That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.</p>

Andrew, and Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">No, faith, I&#8217;ll not stay a jot longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to
the
count&#8217;s serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
I saw&#8217;t i&#8217; the orchard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">As plain as I see you now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">This was a great argument of love in her toward
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Slight, will you make an ass o&#8217;
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths
of
judgment and reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">And they have been grand-jury-men since before
Noah
was a sailor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">She did show favour to the youth in your sight
only
to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
You should then have accosted her; and with some
excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
lady&#8217;s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
on a Dutchman&#8217;s beard, unless you do redeem it by
some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t be any way, it must be with valour;
for policy
I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
politician.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis
of
valour. Challenge me the count&#8217;s youth to fight
with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
love-broker in the world can more prevail in man&#8217;s
commendation with woman than report of valour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Will either of you bear me a challenge to
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and
brief;
it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
if thou thou&#8217;st him some thrice, it shall not be
amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
bed of Ware in England, set &#8217;em down: go, about it.
Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Where shall I find you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll call thee at the cubiculo: go.</p>

<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.</p>

<p class="speech">I have been dear to him, lad, some two
thousand
strong, or so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">We shall have a rare letter from him: but
you&#8217;ll
not deliver&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on
the
youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
will clog the foot of a flea, I&#8217;ll eat the rest of
the anatomy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>

no

<p class="speech">Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">If you desire the spleen, and will laugh
yourself
into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
Christian, that means to be saved by believing
rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
of grossness. He&#8217;s in yellow stockings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">And cross-gartered?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a
school
i&#8217; the church. I have dogged him, like his
murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
face into more lines than is in the new map with the
augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
a thing as &#8217;tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,

More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;<br>
And not all love to see you, though so much<br>
As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,<br>

I do not without danger walk these streets:<br>
Once, in a sea-fight, &#8217;gainst the count his galleys<br>

<p class="speech">The offence is not of such a bloody nature;<br>
Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel<br>
Might well have given us bloody argument.<br>
It might have since been answer&#8217;d in repaying<br>
What we took from them; which, for traffic&#8217;s sake,<br>
Most of our city did: only myself stood out;<br>
For which, if I be lapsed in this place,<br>
I shall pay dear.</p>

Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with

&#8216;be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
thyself into the trick of singularity;&#8217; and
consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
limed her; but it is Jove&#8217;s doing, and Jove make me
thankful! And when she went away now, &#8216;Let this
fellow be looked to:&#8217; fellow! not Malvolio, nor
after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
or unsafe circumstance&#8212;What can be said? Nothing
that can be can come between me and the full
prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the

it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Carry his water to the wise woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if
I

<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way:
do
you not see you move him? let me alone with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend
is
rough, and will not be roughly used.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou,
chuck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! &#8217;tis
not for
gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
him, foul collier!</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get
him to pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">My prayers, minx!</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">No, I warrant you, he will not hear of
godliness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>

things: I am not of your element: you shall know

condemn it as an improbable fiction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">His very genius hath taken the infection of the
device, man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and
taint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Why, we shall make him mad indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">The house will be the quieter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Come, we&#8217;ll have him in a dark room and
bound. My
niece is already in the belief that he&#8217;s mad: we
may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
finder of madmen. But see, but see.</p>

<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, is&#8217;t, I warrant him: do but read.</p>

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;Thou

<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Very brief, and to exceeding good

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>

thee well; and God have mercy upon
one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy

Andrew Aguecheek.&#8217;
<p class="speech">If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:<br>
I&#8217;ll give&#8217;t him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">You may have very fit occasion for&#8217;t: he is
now in
some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner
the
orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
more approbation than ever proof itself would have
earned him. Away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let me alone for swearing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Now will not I deliver his letter: for the
behavior
of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
capacity and breeding; his employment between his
lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
This will so fright them both that they will kill
one another by the look, like cockatrices.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Olivia, with
Viola</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Here he comes with your niece: give them way

he take leave, and presently after him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">I will meditate the while upon some horrid
message
for a challenge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Sir Toby Belch,
Fabian, and Maria</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">I have said too much unto a heart of stone<br>
And laid mine honour too unchary out:<br>
There&#8217;s something in me that reproves my fault;<br>
But such a headstrong potent fault it is,<br>
That it but mocks reproof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">With the same &#8217;havior that your passion
bears<br>
Goes on my master&#8217;s grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Here, wear this jewel for me, &#8217;tis my

Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;<br>

What shall you ask of me that I&#8217;ll deny,<br>
That honour saved may upon asking give?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but this; your true love for my
master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">How with mine honour may I give him that<br>

<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I will acquit you.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Sir Toby Belch and
Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Gentleman, God save thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">And you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">That defence thou hast, betake thee to&#8217;t:
of what
nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any
quarrel
to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
any image of offence done to any man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll find it otherwise, I assure you:
therefore,
if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, what is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and
on
carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give&#8217;t or
take&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I will return again into the house and desire
some
conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
of that quirk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of
a
very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
house, unless you undertake that with me which with
as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
must, that&#8217;s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do
me
this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
my offence to him is: it is something of my
negligence, nothing of my purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by
this
gentleman till my return.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">I know the knight is incensed against you, even
to a
mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him
by
his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I shall be much bound to you for&#8217;t: I am
one that
had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
care not who knows so much of my mettle.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

Sir Andrew</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, he&#8217;s a very devil; I have not
seen such a
firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Pox on&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll not meddle with
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian
can
scarce hold him yonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Plague on&#8217;t, an I thought he had been
valiant and so
cunning in fence, I&#8217;ld have seen him damned ere
I&#8217;ld
have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
and I&#8217;ll give him my horse, grey Capilet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Fabian and
Viola</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speech">I have his horse to take up the quarrel:<br>
I have persuaded him the youth&#8217;s a devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants
and
looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Viola]</span>
There&#8217;s no remedy, sir; he will fight
with you for&#8217;s oath sake: marry, he hath better
bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Pray God
defend me! A little thing would
make me tell them how much I lack of a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Give ground, if you see him furious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Sir Andrew, there&#8217;s no remedy; the
gentleman
will, for his honour&#8217;s sake, have one bout with you;
he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
will not hurt you. Come on; to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">Pray God, he keep his oath!</p>

<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">You, sir! why, what are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more<br>

<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>

<p class="speech">This is the man; do thy office.</p>

Orsino.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>

<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,<br>
Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.<br>
Take him away: he knows I know him well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I must obey.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Viola</span></p>
<p class="speech">This comes with seeking you:<br>
But there&#8217;s no remedy; I shall answer it.<br>
What will you do, now my necessity<br>
Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me<br>
Much more for what I cannot do for you<br>
Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;<br>
But be of comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I must entreat of you some of that money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">What money, sir?<br>
For the fair kindness you have show&#8217;d me here,<br>
And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,<br>
Out of my lean and low ability<br>
I&#8217;ll lend you something: my having is not much;<br>
I&#8217;ll make division of my present with you:<br>
Hold, there&#8217;s half my coffer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Will you deny me now?<br>
Is&#8217;t possible that my deserts to you<br>
Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,<br>
Lest that it make me so unsound a man<br>
As to upbraid you with those kindnesses<br>
That I have done for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">I know of none;<br>
Nor know I you by voice or any feature:<br>
I hate ingratitude more in a man<br>
Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,<br>
Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption<br>
Inhabits our frail blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O heavens themselves!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, I pray you, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Let me speak a little. This youth that you see
here<br>
I snatch&#8217;d one half out of the jaws of death,<br>
Relieved him with such sanctity of love,<br>
And to his image, which methought did promise<br>
Most venerable worth, did I devotion.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that to us? The time goes by:
away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">But O how vile an idol proves this god<br>
Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.<br>
In nature there&#8217;s no blemish but the mind;<br>
None can be call&#8217;d deform&#8217;d but the unkind:<br>
Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil<br>
Are empty trunks o&#8217;erflourish&#8217;d by the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come,

Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune<br>

A bawbling vessel was he captain of,<br>
For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;<br>
With which such scathful grapple did he make<br>
With the most noble bottom of our fleet,<br>
That very envy and the tongue of loss<br>
Cried fame and honour on him. What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>

Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:<br>
Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,<br>

Orsino&#8217;s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:<br>
That most ingrateful boy there by your side,<br>
From the rude sea&#8217;s enraged and foamy mouth<br>
Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:<br>
His life I gave him and did thereto add<br>
My love, without retention or restraint,<br>
All his in dedication; for his sake<br>
Did I expose myself, pure for his love,<br>
Into the danger of this adverse town;<br>
Drew to defend him when he was beset:<br>
Where being apprehended, his false cunning,<br>
Not meaning to partake with me in danger,<br>
Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,<br>
And grew a twenty years removed thing<br>
While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,<br>
Which I had recommended to his use<br>
Not half an hour before.</p>

That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:<br>
Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,<br>
And that I partly know the instrument<br>
That screws me from my true place in your favour,<br>
Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;<br>
But this your minion, whom I know you love,<br>
And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,<br>
Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,<br>
Where he sits crowned in his master&#8217;s spite.<br>
Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:<br>
I&#8217;ll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,<br>
To spite a raven&#8217;s heart within a dove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>

Be that thou know&#8217;st thou art, and then thou art<br>
As great as that thou fear&#8217;st.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Priest</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, welcome, father!<br>
Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,<br>
Here to unfold, though lately we intended<br>
To keep in darkness what occasion now<br>
Reveals before &#8217;tis ripe, what thou dost know<br>
Hath newly pass&#8217;d between this youth and me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Priest</p>
<p class="speech">A contract of eternal bond of love,<br>
Confirm&#8217;d by mutual joinder of your hands,<br>
Attested by the holy close of lips,<br>
Strengthen&#8217;d by interchangement of your rings;<br>
And all the ceremony of this compact<br>
Seal&#8217;d in my function, by my testimony:<br>
Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave<br>
I have travell&#8217;d but two hours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be<br>
When time hath sow&#8217;d a grizzle on thy case?<br>
Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,<br>
That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?<br>
Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet<br>
Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I do protest&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not swear!<br>
Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Andrew</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one
presently
to Sir Toby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">He has broke my head across and has given Sir
Toby
a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Who has done this, Sir Andrew?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">The count&#8217;s gentleman, one Cesario: we took
him for
a coward, but he&#8217;s the very devil incardinate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">My gentleman, Cesario?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Od&#8217;s lifelings, here he is! You
broke my head for
nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do&#8217;t
by Sir Toby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:<br>
You drew your sword upon me without cause;<br>
But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me:
I
think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Toby Belch and
Clown</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear
more:
but if he had not been in drink, he would have
tickled you othergates than he did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">How now, gentleman! how is&#8217;t with you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s all one: has hurt me, and
there&#8217;s the end
on&#8217;t. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">O, he&#8217;s drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his
eyes
were set at eight i&#8217; the morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Then he&#8217;s a rogue, and a passy measures
panyn: I
hate a drunken rogue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with
them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Andrew</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll help you, Sir Toby, because well be
dressed together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Toby Belch</p>
<p class="speech">Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and
a
knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look&#8217;d
to.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Clown, Fabian, Sir
Toby Belch, and Sir Andrew</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sebastian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:<br>
But, had it been the brother of my blood,<br>
I must have done no less with wit and safety.<br>
You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that<br>
I do perceive it hath offended you:<br>
Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows<br>
We made each other but so late ago.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">One face, one voice, one habit, and two
persons,<br>
A natural perspective, that is and is not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Antonio, O my dear Antonio!<br>
How have the hours rack&#8217;d and tortured me,<br>
Since I have lost thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Sebastian are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fear&#8217;st thou that,
Antonio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">How have you made division of yourself?<br>
An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin<br>
Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Most wonderful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Do I stand there? I never had a brother;<br>
Nor can there be that deity in my nature,<br>
Of here and every where. I had a sister,<br>
Whom the blind waves and surges have devour&#8217;d.<br>
Of charity, what kin are you to me?<br>
What countryman? what name? what parentage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;<br>
Such a Sebastian was my brother too,<br>
So went he suited to his watery tomb:<br>
If spirits can assume both form and suit<br>
You come to fright us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A spirit I am indeed;<br>
But am in that dimension grossly clad<br>
Which from the womb I did participate.<br>
Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,<br>
I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,<br>
And say &#8216;Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">My father had a mole upon his brow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">And so had mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">And died that day when Viola from her birth<br>
Had number&#8217;d thirteen years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">O, that record is lively in my soul!<br>
He finished indeed his mortal act<br>
That day that made my sister thirteen years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">If nothing lets to make us happy both<br>
But this my masculine usurp&#8217;d attire,<br>
Do not embrace me till each circumstance<br>
Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump<br>
That I am Viola: which to confirm,<br>
I&#8217;ll bring you to a captain in this town,<br>
Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help<br>
I was preserved to serve this noble count.<br>
All the occurrence of my fortune since<br>
Hath been between this lady and this lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Olivia]</span> So comes
it, lady, you have been mistook:<br>
But nature to her bias drew in that.<br>
You would have been contracted to a maid;<br>
Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,<br>
You are betroth&#8217;d both to a maid and man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.<br>
If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,<br>
I shall have share in this most happy wreck.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Viola</span></p>
<p class="speech">Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times<br>
Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">And all those sayings will I overswear;<br>
And those swearings keep as true in soul<br>
As doth that orbed continent the fire<br>
That severs day from night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand;<br>
And let me see thee in thy woman&#8217;s weeds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Viola</p>
<p class="speech">The captain that did bring me first on shore<br>
Hath my maid&#8217;s garments: he upon some action<br>
Is now in durance, at Malvolio&#8217;s suit,<br>
A gentleman, and follower of my lady&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:<br>
And yet, alas, now I remember me,<br>
They say, poor gentleman, he&#8217;s much distract.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Clown with a letter,
and Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speech">A most extracting frenzy of mine own<br>
From my remembrance clearly banish&#8217;d his.<br>
How does he, sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the
staves&#8217;s end as
well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
letter to you; I should have given&#8217;t you to-day
morning, but as a madman&#8217;s epistles are no gospels,
so it skills not much when they are delivered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Open&#8217;t, and read it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Look then to be well edified when the fool
delivers
the madman.</p>

<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">How now! art thou mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam, I do but read madness: an your
ladyship
will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, read i&#8217; thy right wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is
to
read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Read it you, sirrah.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;By the
Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
world shall know it: though you have put me into
darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
unthought of and speak out of my injury.
The Madly-Used Malvolio.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Did he write this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">This savours not much of distraction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">See him deliver&#8217;d, Fabian; bring him
hither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Fabian</span></p>
<p class="speech">My lord so please you, these things further
thought on,<br>
To think me as well a sister as a wife,<br>
One day shall crown the alliance on&#8217;t, so please you,<br>
Here at my house and at my proper cost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Viola</span></p>
<p class="speech">Your master quits you; and for your service done
him,<br>
So much against the mettle of your sex,<br>
So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,<br>
And since you call&#8217;d me master for so long,<br>
Here is my hand: you shall from this time be<br>
Your master&#8217;s mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">A sister! you are she.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Fabian, with
Malvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Orsino</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the madman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord, this same.<br>
How now, Malvolio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Madam, you have done me wrong,<br>
Notorious wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Have I, Malvolio? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.<br>
You must not now deny it is your hand:<br>
Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;<br>
Or say &#8217;tis not your seal, nor your invention:<br>
You can say none of this: well, grant it then<br>
And tell me, in the modesty of honour,<br>
Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,<br>
Bade me come smiling and cross-garter&#8217;d to you,<br>
To put on yellow stockings and to frown<br>
Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;<br>
And, acting this in an obedient hope,<br>
Why have you suffer&#8217;d me to be imprison&#8217;d,<br>
Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,<br>
And made the most notorious geck and gull<br>
That e&#8217;er invention play&#8217;d on? tell me why.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,<br>
Though, I confess, much like the character<br>
But out of question &#8217;tis Maria&#8217;s hand.<br>
And now I do bethink me, it was she<br>
First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,<br>
And in such forms which here were presupposed<br>
Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:<br>
This practise hath most shrewdly pass&#8217;d upon thee;<br>
But when we know the grounds and authors of it,<br>
Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge<br>
Of thine own cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fabian</p>
<p class="speech">Good madam, hear me speak,<br>
And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come<br>
Taint the condition of this present hour,<br>
Which I have wonder&#8217;d at. In hope it shall not,<br>
Most freely I confess, myself and Toby<br>
Set this device against Malvolio here,<br>
Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts<br>
We had conceived against him: Maria writ<br>
The letter at Sir Toby&#8217;s great importance;<br>
In recompense whereof he hath married her.<br>
How with a sportful malice it was follow&#8217;d,<br>
May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;<br>
If that the injuries be justly weigh&#8217;d<br>
That have on both sides pass&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Olivia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8216;some are born great, some achieve
greatness,
and some have greatness thrown upon them.&#8217; I was
one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
that&#8217;s all one. &#8216;By the Lord, fool, I am not
mad.&#8217;
But do you remember? &#8216;Madam, why laugh you at such
a barren rascal? an you smile not, he&#8217;s gagged:&#8217;
and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be revenged on the whole pack of
you.</p>

He hath not told us of the captain yet:<br>
When that is known and golden time convents,<br>
A solemn combination shall be made<br>
Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,<br>
We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;<br>
For so you shall be, while you are a man;<br>
But when in other habits you are seen,<br>

With hey, ho, &amp; c.<br>
&#8217;Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,<br>
For the rain, &amp; c.<br>

By swaggering could I never thrive,<br>
For the rain, &amp; c.<br>
But when I came unto my beds,<br>
With hey, ho, &amp; c.<br>
With toss-pots still had drunken heads,<br>
For the rain, &amp; c.<br>
A great while ago the world begun,<br>
