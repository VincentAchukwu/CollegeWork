<h3>Introduction <a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
<p>Coriolanus is one of Shakespeare's later plays, appearing about 1607.

<p>This tragedy revolves around Caius Martius Coriolanus, a brilliant Roman
general who ultimately is banished from Rome and leads an assault on
that same city. Only the pleadings of his mother stop him from sacking
Rome, a change of heart which leads to his destruction.

<p>Coriolanus is a legendary figure who is said to
have lived during the 5th century BC. Born Gaius Marcius, he was given
the surname as a result of his action in capturing the Volscian town of
Corioli in 439 BC.

<p>According to Plutarch<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>,
Coriolanus represented the Roman aristocracy and
was well respected in the Roman Senate for arguing against the
democratic inclinations of the plebians. He was perpetually banished
from Rome upon being convicted on charges of misapropriation of public
funds. He later turned against Rome and made allegiance with the same
Volscians he had once fought against. Plutarch's account of his
defection tells that Coriolanus donned a disguise and snuck into the
home of a wealthy Volcian noble, a certain Tullus Aufidius, and appealed
to him as a suppliant. Coriolanus and Aufidius then persuaded the
Volscians to break their truce with Rome and raise an army to invade.
When Coriolanus' Volscian troops threatened the city, Roman matrons,
including his wife and mother, were sent to persuade him to call off the
attack. At the sight of his mother, wife and children throwing
themselves at his feet in supplication, Coriolanus relented, withdrew
his troops from the border of Rome, and retired to Aufidius' home city
of Antium. Aufidius then raised support to have Coriolanus put on trial
by the Volcians, and then formed a conspiracy to assassinate him before
the trial had ended.

<p>The tale of Coriolanus' appeal to Aufidius is quite similar to a tale
from the life of Themistocles, a leader of the Athenian_democracy who
was a contemporary of Coriolanus (given the important dictinction that
Themistocles was an actual historical figure and Coriolanus was not).
During Themistocles' exile from Athens, he travelled to the home of
Admetus, King of the Molossians, a man who was his personal enemy.
Themistocles came to Admetus in disguise and appealed to him as a
fugitive, just as Coriolanus appealed to Aufidius. Themistocles,
however, never attempted military retailiation against Athens.

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a company of mutinous
Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You are all resolved rather to die than to
famish?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Resolved. resolved.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to
the people.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">We know&#8217;t, we know&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Let us kill him, and we&#8217;ll have corn at our
own price.<br>
Is&#8217;t a verdict?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">No more talking on&#8217;t; let it be done: away,
away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">One word, good citizens.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians
good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Would you proceed especially against Caius
Marcius?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Against him first: he&#8217;s a very dog to the
commonalty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Consider you what services he has done for his
country?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Very well; and could be content to give him
good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but speak not maliciously.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he
did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">What he cannot help in his nature, you account
a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If I must not, I need not be barren of
accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Shouts within</span></p>
<p class="speech">What shouts are these? The other side o&#8217;
the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Soft! who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Menenius
Agrippa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always
loved
the people.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s one honest enough: would all the rest
were so!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What work&#8217;s, my countrymen, in hand? where
go you<br>
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Our business is not unknown to the senate; they
have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest
neighbours,<br>
Will you undo yourselves?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you, friends, most charitable care<br>
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,<br>
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well<br>
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them<br>
Against the Roman state, whose course will on<br>
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs<br>
Of more strong link asunder than can ever<br>
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,<br>
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br>
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br>
You are transported by calamity<br>
Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br>
The helms o&#8217; the state, who care for you like fathers,<br>
When you curse them as enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Care for us! True, indeed! They ne&#8217;er cared
for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there&#8217;s all the love they bear us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Either you must<br>
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,<br>
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you<br>
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;<br>
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture<br>
To stale &#8217;t a little more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I&#8217;ll hear it, sir: yet you must not
think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an &#8217;t please
you, deliver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">There was a time when all the body&#8217;s
members<br>
Rebell&#8217;d against the belly, thus accused it:<br>
That only like a gulf it did remain<br>
I&#8217; the midst o&#8217; the body, idle and unactive,<br>
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing<br>
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments<br>
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,<br>
And, mutually participate, did minister<br>
Unto the appetite and affection common<br>
Of the whole body. The belly answer&#8217;d&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,<br>
Which ne&#8217;er came from the lungs, but even thus&#8212;<br>
For, look you, I may make the belly smile<br>
As well as speak&#8212;it tauntingly replied<br>
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts<br>
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly<br>
As you malign our senators for that<br>
They are not such as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Your belly&#8217;s answer? What!<br>
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,<br>
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,<br>
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.<br>
With other muniments and petty helps<br>
In this our fabric, if that they&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What then?<br>
&#8217;Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Should by the cormorant belly be
restrain&#8217;d,<br>
Who is the sink o&#8217; the body,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">The former agents, if they did complain,<br>
What could the belly answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you<br>
If you&#8217;ll bestow a small&#8212;of what you have
little&#8212;<br>
Patience awhile, you&#8217;ll hear the belly&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Ye&#8217;re long about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Note me this, good friend;<br>
Your most grave belly was deliberate,<br>
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer&#8217;d:<br>
&#8216;True is it, my incorporate friends,&#8217; quoth he,<br>
&#8216;That I receive the general food at first,<br>
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,<br>
Because I am the store-house and the shop<br>
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,<br>
I send it through the rivers of your blood,<br>
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o&#8217; the brain;<br>
And, through the cranks and offices of man,<br>
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins<br>
From me receive that natural competency<br>
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,<br>
You, my good friends,&#8217;&#8212;this says the belly, mark
me,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; well, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Though all at once cannot<br>
See what I do deliver out to each,<br>
Yet I can make my audit up, that all<br>
From me do back receive the flour of all,<br>
And leave me but the bran.&#8217; What say you to&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">It was an answer: how apply you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Rome are this good belly,<br>
And you the mutinous members; for examine<br>
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly<br>
Touching the weal o&#8217; the common, you shall find<br>
No public benefit which you receive<br>
But it proceeds or comes from them to you<br>
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,<br>
You, the great toe of this assembly?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">I the great toe! why the great toe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">For that, being one o&#8217; the lowest, basest,
poorest,<br>
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go&#8217;st foremost:<br>
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,<br>
Lead&#8217;st first to win some vantage.<br>
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:<br>
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;<br>
The one side must have bale.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Caius
Marcius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hail, noble Marcius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks. What&#8217;s the matter, you dissentious
rogues,<br>
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,<br>
Make yourselves scabs?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We have ever your good word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">He that will give good words to thee will
flatter<br>
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,<br>
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,<br>
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,<br>
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;<br>
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,<br>
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,<br>
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is<br>
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him<br>
And curse that justice did it.<br>
Who deserves greatness<br>
Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br>
A sick man&#8217;s appetite, who desires most that<br>
Which would increase his evil. He that depends<br>
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead<br>
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?<br>
With every minute you do change a mind,<br>
And call him noble that was now your hate,<br>
Him vile that was your garland. What&#8217;s the matter,<br>
That in these several places of the city<br>
You cry against the noble senate, who,<br>
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br>
Would feed on one another? What&#8217;s their seeking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">For corn at their own rates; whereof, they
say,<br>
The city is well stored.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Hang &#8217;em! They say!<br>
They&#8217;ll sit by the fire, and presume to know<br>
What&#8217;s done i&#8217; the Capitol; who&#8217;s like to
rise,<br>
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and give out<br>
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong<br>
And feebling such as stand not in their liking<br>
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there&#8217;s
grain enough!<br>
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,<br>
And let me use my sword, I&#8217;ll make a quarry<br>
With thousands of these quarter&#8217;d slaves, as high<br>
As I could pick my lance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;<br>
For though abundantly they lack discretion,<br>
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,<br>
What says the other troop?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">They are dissolved: hang &#8217;em!<br>
They said they were an-hungry; sigh&#8217;d forth proverbs,<br>
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,<br>
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not<br>
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds<br>
They vented their complainings; which being answer&#8217;d,<br>
And a petition granted them, a strange one&#8212;<br>
To break the heart of generosity,<br>
And make bold power look pale&#8212;they threw their caps<br>
As they would hang them on the horns o&#8217; the moon,<br>
Shouting their emulation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What is granted them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,<br>
Of their own choice: one&#8217;s Junius Brutus,<br>
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not&#8212;&#8217;sdeath!<br>
The rabble should have first unroof&#8217;d the city,<br>
Ere so prevail&#8217;d with me: it will in time<br>
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes<br>
For insurrection&#8217;s arguing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">This is strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Go, get you home, you fragments!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger,

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Caius Marcius?</p>

<p class="speech">Marcius, &#8217;tis true that you have lately
told us;<br>
The Volsces are in arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">They have a leader,<br>
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to &#8217;t.<br>
I sin in envying his nobility,<br>
And were I any thing but what I am,<br>
I would wish me only he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">You have fought together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Were half to half the world by the ears and
he.<br>
Upon my party, I&#8217;ld revolt to make<br>
Only my wars with him: he is a lion<br>
That I am proud to hunt.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Then, worthy Marcius,<br>
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">It is your former promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is;<br>
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou<br>
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus&#8217; face.<br>
What, art thou stiff? stand&#8217;st out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Caius Marcius;<br>
I&#8217;ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t&#8217;other,<br>
Ere stay behind this business.</p>

To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,<br>
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.</p>

<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Be-mock the modest moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The present wars devour him: he is grown<br>
Too proud to be so valiant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Such a nature,<br>
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow<br>
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder<br>
His insolence can brook to be commanded<br>
Under Cominius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Fame, at the which he aims,<br>
In whom already he&#8217;s well graced, can not<br>
Better be held nor more attain&#8217;d than by<br>
A place below the first: for what miscarries<br>
Shall be the general&#8217;s fault, though he perform<br>
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure<br>
Will then cry out of Marcius &#8216;O if he<br>
Had borne the business!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, if things go well,<br>
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall<br>
Of his demerits rob Cominius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Come:<br>
Half all Cominius&#8217; honours are to Marcius.<br>
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults<br>
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed<br>
In aught he merit not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s hence, and hear<br>
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,<br>

in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings&#8217; entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.</p>

therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love

Though you were born in Rome:&#8217; his bloody brow<br>
With his mail&#8217;d hand then wiping, forth he goes,<br>

I&#8217;ll swear,&#8217;tis a
very pretty boy. O&#8217; my troth, I looked upon him o&#8217;
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how &#8217;twas, he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!</p>

from
him last night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">In earnest, it&#8217;s true; I heard a senator
speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>

every
thing hereafter.</p>

but
disease our better mirth.</p>

Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy

Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight<br>
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:<br>

Further than seen and one infect another<br>
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,<br>
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run<br>
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!<br>
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale<br>

<p class="speech">I do beseech you,<br>
By all the battles wherein we have fought,<br>
By the blood we have shed together, by the vows<br>
We have made to endure friends, that you directly<br>
Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;<br>
And that you not delay the present, but,<br>
Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,<br>
We prove this very hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>

But is four Volsces? none of you but is<br>
Able to bear against the great Aufidius<br>
A shield as hard as his. A certain number,<br>
Though thanks to all, must I select

though I must be content to bear with those that say
you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that

second day of audience. When you are hearing a
matter between party and party, if you chance to be
pinched with the colic, you make faces like
mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
a pair of strange ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you are well understood to be a
perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
bencher in the Capitol.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Our very priests must become mockers, if they
shall
encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher&#8217;s
cushion, or to be entombed in an ass&#8217;s pack-
saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
best of &#8217;em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
your worships: more of your conversation would
infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Brutus and Sicinius go
aside</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and
Valeria</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, my as fair as noble ladies,&#8212;and
the moon,
were she earthly, no nobler,&#8212;whither do you follow
your eyes so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches;
for
the love of Juno, let&#8217;s go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! Marcius coming home!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
approbation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!<br>
Marcius coming home!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay,&#8217;tis true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Look, here&#8217;s a letter from him: the state
hath
another, his wife another; and, I think, there&#8217;s one
at home for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter
for
me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, certain, there&#8217;s a letter for you; I
saw&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">A letter for me! it gives me an estate of
seven
years&#8217; health; in which time I will make a lip at
the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, no, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">O, he is wounded; I thank the gods
for&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">So do I too, if it be not too much: brings
a&#8217;
victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">On&#8217;s brows: Menenius, he comes the third
time home
with the oaken garland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Titus Lartius writes, they fought together,
but<br>
Aufidius got off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">And &#8217;twas time for him too, I&#8217;ll
warrant him that:
an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
that&#8217;s in them. Is the senate possessed of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Good ladies, let&#8217;s go. Yes, yes, yes; the
senate
has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
action outdone his former deeds doubly</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">In troth, there&#8217;s wondrous things spoke of
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without
his
true purchasing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">The gods grant them true!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">True! pow, wow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">True! I&#8217;ll be sworn they are true.<br>
Where is he wounded?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To the Tribunes</span></p>
<p class="speech">God save your good worships! Marcius is
coming
home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; the shoulder and i&#8217; the left arm
there will be
large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
Tarquin seven hurts i&#8217; the body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">One i&#8217; the neck, and two i&#8217; the
thigh,&#8212;there&#8217;s
nine that I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">He had, before this last expedition,
twenty-five
wounds upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Now it&#8217;s twenty-seven: every gash was an
enemy&#8217;s grave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A shout and
flourish</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark! the trumpets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">These are the ushers of Marcius: before him
he
carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:<br>
Death, that dark spirit, in &#8217;s nervy arm doth lie;<br>
Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A sennet. Trumpets sound.

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep<br>
And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.<br>
A curse begin at very root on&#8217;s heart,<br>
That is not glad to see thee! You are three<br>
That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,<br>
We have some old crab-trees here
at home that will not<br>
Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:<br>
We call a nettle but a nettle and<br>
The faults of fools but folly.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in
state, as before. Brutus and Sicinius come forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">All tongues speak of him, and the bleared
sights<br>
Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse<br>
Into a rapture lets her baby cry<br>
While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins<br>
Her richest lockram &#8217;bout her reechy neck,<br>
Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,<br>
Are smother&#8217;d up, leads fill&#8217;d, and ridges horsed<br>
With variable complexions, all agreeing<br>
In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens<br>
Do press among the popular throngs and puff<br>
To win a vulgar station: or veil&#8217;d dames<br>
Commit the war of white and damask in<br>
Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil<br>
Of Phoebus&#8217; burning kisses: such a pother<br>
As if that whatsoever god who leads him<br>
Were slily crept into his human powers<br>
And gave him graceful posture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">On the sudden,<br>
I warrant him consul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Then our office may,<br>
During his power, go sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot temperately transport his honours<br>
From where he should begin and end, but will<br>
Lose those he hath won.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">In that there&#8217;s comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Doubt not<br>
The commoners, for whom we stand, but they<br>
Upon their ancient malice will forget<br>
With the least cause these his new honours, which<br>
That he will give them make I as little question<br>
As he is proud to do&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I heard him swear,<br>
Were he to stand for consul, never would he<br>
Appear i&#8217; the market-place nor on him put<br>
The napless vesture of humility;<br>
Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds<br>
To the people, beg their stinking breaths.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">It was his word: O, he would miss it rather<br>
Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,<br>
And the desire of the nobles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">I wish no better<br>
Than have him hold that purpose and to put it<br>
In execution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis most like he will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">It shall be to him then as our good wills,<br>
A sure destruction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">So it must fall out<br>
To him or our authorities. For an end,<br>
We must suggest the people in what hatred<br>
He still hath held them; that to&#8217;s power he would<br>
Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and<br>
Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,<br>
In human action and capacity,<br>
Of no more soul nor fitness for the world<br>
Than camels in the war, who have their provand<br>
Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows<br>
For sinking under them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">This, as you say, suggested<br>
At some time when his soaring insolence<br>
Shall touch the people&#8212;which time shall not want,<br>
If he be put upon &#8217;t; and that&#8217;s as easy<br>
As to set dogs on sheep&#8212;will be his fire<br>

<p class="speech">You are sent for to the Capitol. &#8217;Tis
thought<br>
That Marcius shall be consul:<br>
I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and<br>
The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,<br>
Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,<br>
Upon him as he pass&#8217;d: the nobles bended,<br>
As to Jove&#8217;s statue, and the commons made<br>
A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:<br>
I never saw the like.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two Officers, to lay
cushions</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, they are almost here. How many
stand
for consulships?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Three, they say: but &#8217;tis thought of every
one<br>
Coriolanus will carry it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a brave fellow; but he&#8217;s
vengeance proud, and
loves not the common people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, there had been many great men that
have
flattered the people, who ne&#8217;er loved them; and there
be many that they have loved, they know not
wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
them plainly see&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">If he did not care whether he had their love or
no,
he waved indifferently &#8217;twixt doing them neither
good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
devotion than can render it him; and leaves
nothing undone that may fully discover him their
opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
dislikes, to flatter them for their love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Officer</p>
<p class="speech">He hath deserved worthily of his country: and
his
ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
having been supple and courteous to the people,
bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Officer</p>
<p class="speech">No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way,
they
are coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A sennet. Enter, with actors

Most reverend and grave elders, to desire<br>
The present consul, and last general<br>
In our well-found successes, to report<br>
A little of that worthy work perform&#8217;d<br>

With honours like himself.</p>

But yet my caution was more pertinent<br>
Than the rebuke you give it.</p>

<p class="speech">Nay, keep your place.</p>

<p class="speech">Sir, I hope<br>
My words disbench&#8217;d you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir: yet oft,<br>
When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.<br>
You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
your people,<br>
I love them as they weigh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Pray now, sit down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather have one scratch my head i&#8217;

When the alarum were struck than idly sit<br>
To hear my nothings monster&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Masters of the people,<br>
Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter&#8212;<br>
That&#8217;s thousand to one good one&#8212;when you now see<br>
He had rather venture all his limbs for honour<br>
Than one on&#8217;s ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus<br>
Should not be utter&#8217;d feebly. It is held<br>
That valour is the chiefest virtue, and<br>
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,<br>
The man I speak of cannot in the world<br>
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,<br>
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought<br>
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,<br>
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,<br>
When with his Amazonian chin he drove<br>
The bristled lips before him: be bestrid<br>
An o&#8217;er-press&#8217;d Roman and i&#8217; the consul&#8217;s
view<br>
Slew three opposers: Tarquin&#8217;s self he met,<br>
And struck him on his knee: in that day&#8217;s feats,<br>
When he might act the woman in the scene,<br>
He proved best man i&#8217; the field, and for his meed<br>
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age<br>
Man-enter&#8217;d thus, he waxed like a sea,<br>
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since<br>
He lurch&#8217;d all swords of the garland. For this last,<br>
Before and in Corioli, let me say,<br>
I cannot speak him home: he stopp&#8217;d the fliers;<br>
And by his rare example made the coward<br>
Turn terror into sport: as weeds before<br>
A vessel under sail, so men obey&#8217;d<br>
And fell below his stem: his sword, death&#8217;s stamp,<br>
Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot<br>
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion<br>
Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter&#8217;d<br>
The mortal gate of the city, which he painted<br>
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,<br>
And with a sudden reinforcement struck<br>
Corioli like a planet: now all&#8217;s his:<br>
When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce<br>
His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit<br>
Re-quicken&#8217;d what in flesh was fatigate,<br>
And to the battle came he; where he did<br>
Run reeking o&#8217;er the lives of men, as if<br>
&#8217;Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call&#8217;d<br>
Both field and city ours, he never stood<br>
To ease his breast with panting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy man!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot but with measure fit the honours<br>
Which we devise him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Our spoils he kick&#8217;d at,<br>
And look&#8217;d upon things precious as they were<br>
The common muck of the world: he covets less<br>
Than misery itself would give; rewards<br>
His deeds with doing them, and is content<br>
To spend the time to end it.</p>

That I may pass this doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>

One jot of ceremony.</p>

Pray you, go fit you to the custom and<br>
Take to you, as your predecessors have,<br>
Your honour with your form.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>

Citizens</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not
to deny him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We may, sir, if we will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is
a
power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
monstrous members.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">And to make us no better thought of, a little
help
will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We have been called so of many; not that our
heads
are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
and their consent of one direct way should be at
once to all the points o&#8217; the compass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit
would
fly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another
man&#8217;s
will;&#8217;tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
if it were at liberty, &#8217;twould, sure, southward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Why that way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">To lose itself in a fog, where being three
parts
melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You are never without your tricks: you may, you
may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
that&#8217;s no matter, the greater part carries it. I
say, if he would incline to the people, there was
never a worthier man.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Coriolanus in a gown of
humility, with Menenius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark
his
behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
by threes. He&#8217;s to make his requests by
particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
you shall go by him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">What must I say?<br>
&#8216;I Pray, sir&#8217;&#8212;Plague upon&#8217;t! I cannot
bring<br>
My tongue to such a pace:&#8212;&#8216;Look, sir, my wounds!<br>
I got them in my country&#8217;s service, when<br>
Some certain of your brethren roar&#8217;d and ran<br>
From the noise of our own drums.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">O me, the gods!<br>
You must not speak of that: you must desire them<br>
To think upon you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Think upon me! hang &#8217;em!<br>
I would they would forget me, like the virtues<br>
Which our divines lose by &#8217;em.</p>

to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Mine own desert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Your own desert!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but not mine own desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">How not your own desire?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir,&#8217;twas never my desire yet to
trouble the
poor with begging.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope
to

<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Well then, I pray, your price o&#8217; the
consulship?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">The price is to ask it kindly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha&#8217;t: I have
wounds to
show you, which shall be yours in private. Your

<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You shall ha&#8217; it, worthy sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">A match, sir. There&#8217;s in all two worthy
voices
begged. I have your alms: adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">But this is something odd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>

<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Your enigma?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You have been a scourge to her enemies, you
have
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
the common people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">You should account me the more virtuous that I
have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; &#8217;tis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fifth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We hope to find you our friend; and therefore

Better it is to die, better to starve,<br>

To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,<br>
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to&#8217;t:<br>
What custom wills, in all things should we do&#8217;t,<br>
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,<br>
And mountainous error be too highly heapt<br>
For truth to o&#8217;er-peer. Rather than fool it so,<br>
Let the high office and the honour go<br>
To one that would do thus. I am half through;<br>
The one part suffer&#8217;d, the other will I do.</p>

Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six<br>
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have<br>
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:<br>
Indeed I would be consul.</p>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,<br>
He mock&#8217;d us when he begg&#8217;d our voices.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Certainly<br>
He flouted us downright.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">No,&#8217;tis his kind of speech: he did not mock
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says<br>
He used us scornfully: he should have show&#8217;d us<br>
His marks of merit, wounds received for&#8217;s country.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so he did, I am sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; no man saw &#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;<br>
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,<br>
&#8216;I would be consul,&#8217; says he: &#8216;aged custom,<br>
But by your voices, will not so permit me;<br>
Your voices therefore.&#8217; When we granted that,<br>
Here was &#8216;I thank you for your voices: thank you:<br>
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,<br>
I have no further with you.&#8217; Was not this mockery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Why either were you ignorant to see&#8217;t,<br>
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness<br>
To yield your voices?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Could you not have told him<br>
As you were lesson&#8217;d, when he had no power,<br>
But was a petty servant to the state,<br>
He was your enemy, ever spake against<br>
Your liberties and the charters that you bear<br>
I&#8217; the body of the weal; and now, arriving<br>
A place of potency and sway o&#8217; the state,<br>
If he should still malignantly remain<br>
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might<br>
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said<br>
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less<br>
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature<br>
Would think upon you for your voices and<br>
Translate his malice towards you into love,<br>
Standing your friendly lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Thus to have said,<br>
As you were fore-advised, had touch&#8217;d his spirit<br>
And tried his inclination; from him pluck&#8217;d<br>
Either his gracious promise, which you might,<br>
As cause had call&#8217;d you up, have held him to<br>
Or else it would have gall&#8217;d his surly nature,<br>
Which easily endures not article<br>
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,<br>
You should have ta&#8217;en the advantage of his choler<br>
And pass&#8217;d him unelected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Did you perceive<br>
He did solicit you in free contempt<br>
When he did need your loves, and do you think<br>
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,<br>
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies<br>
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry<br>
Against the rectorship of judgment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Have you<br>
Ere now denied the asker? and now again<br>
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow<br>
Your sued-for tongues?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s not confirm&#8217;d; we may deny him
yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">And will deny him:<br>
I&#8217;ll have five hundred voices of that sound.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">I twice five hundred and their friends to piece
&#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Get you hence instantly, and tell those
friends,<br>
They have chose a consul that will from them take<br>
Their liberties; make them of no more voice<br>
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking<br>
As therefore kept to do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Let them assemble,<br>
And on a safer judgment all revoke<br>
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,<br>
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not<br>
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,<br>
How in his suit he scorn&#8217;d you; but your loves,<br>
Thinking upon his services, took from you<br>
The apprehension of his present portance,<br>
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion<br>
After the inveterate hate he bears you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Lay<br>
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,<br>
No impediment between, but that you must<br>
Cast your election on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Say, you chose him<br>
More after our commandment than as guided<br>
By your own true affections, and that your minds,<br>
Preoccupied with what you rather must do<br>
Than what you should, made you against the grain<br>
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to
you.<br>
How youngly he began to serve his country,<br>
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,<br>
The noble house o&#8217; the Marcians, from whence came<br>
That Ancus Marcius, Numa&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s son,<br>
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;<br>
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,<br>
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;<br>
And <span class="stage">[Censorinus,]</span> nobly named so,<br>
Twice being <span class="stage">[by the people chosen]</span>
censor,<br>
Was his great ancestor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">One thus descended,<br>
That hath beside well in his person wrought<br>
To be set high in place, we did commend<br>
To your remembrances: but you have found,<br>
Scaling his present bearing with his past,<br>
That he&#8217;s your fixed enemy, and revoke<br>
Your sudden approbation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Say, you ne&#8217;er had done&#8217;t&#8212;<br>
Harp on that still&#8212;but by our putting on;<br>
And presently, when you have drawn your number,<br>
Repair to the Capitol.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>

Repent in their election.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Citizens</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Let them go on;<br>
This mutiny were better put in hazard,<br>
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:<br>
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage<br>
With their refusal, both observe and answer<br>
The vantage of his anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">To the Capitol, come:<br>
We will be there before the stream o&#8217; the people;<br>

market-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The people are incensed against him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Stop,<br>
Or all will fall in broil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Are these your herd?<br>
Must these have voices, that can yield them now<br>
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?<br>
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?<br>
Have you not set them on?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Be calm, be calm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,<br>
To curb the will of the nobility:<br>
Suffer&#8217;t, and live with such as cannot rule<br>
Nor ever will be ruled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Call&#8217;t not a plot:<br>
The people cry you mock&#8217;d them, and of late,<br>
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;<br>
Scandal&#8217;d the suppliants for the people, call&#8217;d
them<br>
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this was known before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Not to them all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Have you inform&#8217;d them sithence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">How! I inform them!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">You are like to do such business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Not unlike,<br>
Each way, to better yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,<br>
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me<br>
Your fellow tribune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">You show too much of that<br>
For which the people stir: if you will pass<br>
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,<br>
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,<br>
Or never be so noble as a consul,<br>
Nor yoke with him for tribune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s be calm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">The people are abused; set on. This paltering<br>
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus<br>
Deserved this so dishonour&#8217;d rub, laid falsely<br>
I&#8217; the plain way of his merit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me of corn!<br>
This was my speech, and I will speak&#8217;t again&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Not now, not now.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not in this heat, sir, now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,<br>
I crave their pardons:<br>
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them<br>
Regard me as I do not flatter, and<br>
Therein behold themselves: I say again,<br>
In soothing them, we nourish &#8217;gainst our senate<br>
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,<br>
Which we ourselves have plough&#8217;d for, sow&#8217;d,
and scatter&#8217;d,<br>
By mingling them with us, the honour&#8217;d number,<br>
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that<br>
Which they have given to beggars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">No more words, we beseech you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">How! no more!<br>
As for my country I have shed my blood,<br>
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs<br>
Coin words till their decay against those measles,<br>
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought<br>
The very way to catch them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You speak o&#8217; the people,<br>
As if you were a god to punish, not<br>
A man of their infirmity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere well<br>
We let the people know&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What, what? his choler?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Choler!<br>
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,<br>
By Jove, &#8217;twould be my mind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">It is a mind<br>
That shall remain a poison where it is,<br>
Not poison any further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Shall remain!<br>
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you<br>
His absolute &#8216;shall&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas from the canon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;shall&#8217;!<br>
O good but most unwise patricians! why,<br>
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus<br>
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,<br>
That with his peremptory &#8216;shall,&#8217; being but<br>
The horn and noise o&#8217; the monster&#8217;s, wants not
spirit<br>
To say he&#8217;ll turn your current in a ditch,<br>
And make your channel his? If he have power<br>
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake<br>
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn&#8217;d,<br>
Be not as common fools; if you are not,<br>
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,<br>
If they be senators: and they are no less,<br>
When, both your voices blended, the great&#8217;st taste<br>
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,<br>
And such a one as he, who puts his &#8216;shall,&#8217;<br>
His popular &#8216;shall&#8217; against a graver bench<br>
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!<br>
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches<br>
To know, when two authorities are up,<br>
Neither supreme, how soon confusion<br>
May enter &#8217;twixt the gap of both and take<br>
The one by the other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, on to the market-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth<br>
The corn o&#8217; the storehouse gratis, as &#8217;twas used<br>
Sometime in Greece,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, no more of that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Though there the people had more absolute
power,<br>
I say, they nourish&#8217;d disobedience, fed<br>
The ruin of the state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, shall the people give<br>
One that speaks thus their voice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll give my reasons,<br>
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn<br>
Was not our recompense, resting well assured<br>
That ne&#8217;er did service for&#8217;t: being press&#8217;d to
the war,<br>
Even when the navel of the state was touch&#8217;d,<br>
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service<br>
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i&#8217; the war<br>
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show&#8217;d<br>
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation<br>
Which they have often made against the senate,<br>
All cause unborn, could never be the motive<br>
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?<br>
How shall this bisson multitude digest<br>
The senate&#8217;s courtesy? Let deeds express<br>
What&#8217;s like to be their words: &#8216;we did request it;<br>
We are the greater poll, and in true fear<br>
They gave us our demands.&#8217; Thus we debase<br>
The nature of our seats and make the rabble<br>
Call our cares fears; which will in time<br>
Break ope the locks o&#8217; the senate and bring in<br>
The crows to peck the eagles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, with over-measure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">No, take more:<br>
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,<br>
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,<br>
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other<br>
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,<br>
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no<br>
Of general ignorance,&#8212;it must omit<br>
Real necessities, and give way the while<br>
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr&#8217;d,
it follows,<br>
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,&#8212;<br>
You that will be less fearful than discreet,<br>
That love the fundamental part of state<br>
More than you doubt the change on&#8217;t, that prefer<br>
A noble life before a long, and wish<br>
To jump a body with a dangerous physic<br>
That&#8217;s sure of death without it, at once pluck out<br>
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick<br>
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour<br>
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state<br>
Of that integrity which should become&#8217;t,<br>
Not having the power to do the good it would,<br>
For the in which doth control&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Has said enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer<br>
As traitors do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou wretch, despite
o&#8217;erwhelm thee!<br>
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?<br>
On whom depending, their obedience fails<br>
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,<br>
When what&#8217;s not meet, but what must be, was law,<br>
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,<br>
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,<br>
And throw their power i&#8217; the dust.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Manifest treason!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;This a consul? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The aediles, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an Aedile</span></p>
<p class="speech">Let him be apprehended.</p>

<p class="speech">in whose name myself<br>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What is about to be? I am out of breath;<br>
Confusion&#8217;s near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes<br>
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!<br>
Speak, good Sicinius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, people; peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak,
speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">You are at point to lose your liberties:<br>
Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,<br>
Whom late you have named for consul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie, fie!<br>
This is the way to kindle, not to quench.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">What is the city but the people?</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">True,<br>
The people are the city.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">By the consent of all, we were

<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">And so are like to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">That is the way to lay the city flat;<br>
To bring the roof to the foundation,<br>
And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,<br>
In heaps and piles of ruin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">This deserves death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Or let us stand to our authority,<br>
Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,<br>
Upon the part o&#8217; the people, in whose power<br>
We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy<br>
Of present death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Therefore lay hold of him;<br>

Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,<br>

<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Speak briefly then;<br>
For we are peremptory to dispatch<br>
This viperous traitor: to eject him hence<br>

Our certain death: therefore it is decreed<br>
He dies to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.<br>
What has he done to Rome that&#8217;s worthy death?<br>
Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost&#8212;<br>
Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,<br>
By many an ounce&#8212;he dropp&#8217;d it for his country;<br>
And what is left, to lose it by his country,<br>

In bolted language; meal and bran together<br>
He throws without distinction. Give me leave,<br>

In peace, to his utmost peril.</p>

I would have had you put your power well on,<br>

Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that<br>

<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>

Though therein you can never be too noble,<br>
But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,<br>
Honour and policy, like unsever&#8217;d friends,<br>
I&#8217; the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,<br>
In peace what each of them by the other lose,<br>
That they combine not there.</p>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

The same you are not, which, for your best ends,<br>
You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,<br>
That it shall hold companionship in peace<br>
With honour, as in war, since that to both<br>
It stands in like request?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Why force you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Because that now it lies you on to speak<br>
To the people; not by your own instruction,<br>
Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,<br>
But with such words that are but rooted in<br>
Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables<br>
Of no allowance to your bosom&#8217;s truth.<br>
Now, this no more dishonours you at all<br>
Than to take in a town with gentle words,<br>
Which else would put you to your fortune and<br>
The hazard of much blood.<br>
I would dissemble with my nature where<br>
My fortunes and my friends at stake required<br>
I should do so in honour: I am in this,<br>
Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;<br>
And you will rather show our general louts<br>
How you can frown than spend a fawn upon &#8217;em,<br>
For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard<br>
Of what that want might ruin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Noble lady!<br>
Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,<br>
Not what is dangerous present, but the loss<br>
Of what is past.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I prithee now, my son,<br>
Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;<br>
And thus far having stretch&#8217;d it&#8212;here be with
them&#8212;<br>
Thy knee bussing the stones&#8212;for in such business<br>
Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant<br>
More learned than the ears&#8212;waving thy head,<br>
Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,<br>
Now humble as the ripest mulberry<br>
That will not hold the handling: or say to them,<br>
Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils<br>
Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,<br>
Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,<br>
In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame<br>
Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far<br>
As thou hast power and person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">This but done,<br>
Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;<br>
For they have pardons, being ask&#8217;d, as free<br>
As words to little purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee now,<br>
Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather<br>
Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf<br>
Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I have been i&#8217; the market-place; and,
sir,&#8217;tis fit<br>
You make strong party, or defend yourself<br>
By calmness or by absence: all&#8217;s in anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Only fair speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I think &#8217;twill serve, if

<p class="speech">He must, and will<br>
Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?<br>
Must I with base tongue give my noble heart<br>
A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do&#8217;t:<br>
Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,<br>
This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it<br>
And throw&#8217;t against the wind. To the market-place!<br>
You have put me now to such a part which never<br>
I shall discharge to the life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, we&#8217;ll prompt you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said<br>
My praises made thee first a soldier, so,<br>
To have my praise for this, perform a part<br>
Thou hast not done before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I must do&#8217;t:<br>
Away, my disposition, and possess me<br>
Some harlot&#8217;s spirit! my throat of war be turn&#8217;d,<br>
Which quired with my drum, into a pipe<br>
Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice<br>
That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves<br>
Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys&#8217; tears take up<br>
The glasses of my sight! a beggar&#8217;s tongue<br>
Make motion through my lips, and my arm&#8217;d knees,<br>
Who bow&#8217;d but in my stirrup, bend like his<br>
That hath received an alms! I will not do&#8217;t,<br>
Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth<br>
And by my body&#8217;s action teach my mind<br>
A most inherent baseness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">At thy choice, then:<br>
To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour<br>
Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let<br>
Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear<br>
Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death<br>
With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list<br>
Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck&#8217;dst it from me,<br>
But owe thy pride thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, be content:<br>
Mother, I am going to the market-place;<br>
Chide me no more. I&#8217;ll mountebank their loves,<br>
Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved<br>
Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:<br>
Commend me to my wife. I&#8217;ll return consul;<br>
Or never trust to what my tongue can do<br>
I&#8217; the way of flattery further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Do your will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm
yourself<br>
To answer mildly; for they are prepared<br>

Than are upon you yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">The word is &#8216;mildly.&#8217; Pray you, let

Rome</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the
beast<br>
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,<br>
Where is your ancient courage? you were used<br>
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;<br>
That common chances common men could bear;<br>
That when the sea was calm all boats alike<br>
Show&#8217;d mastership in floating; fortune&#8217;s blows,<br>
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves<br>
A noble cunning: you were used to load me<br>
With precepts that would make invincible<br>
The heart that conn&#8217;d them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">O heavens! O heavens!</p>

I shall be loved when I am lack&#8217;d. Nay, mother.<br>
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,<br>
If you had been the wife of Hercules,<br>
Six of his labours you&#8217;ld have done, and saved<br>
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,<br>
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:<br>
I&#8217;ll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,<br>
Thy tears are salter than a younger man&#8217;s,<br>
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,<br>
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld<br>
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women<br>
&#8217;Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,<br>
As &#8217;tis to laugh at &#8217;em. My mother, you wot well<br>
My hazards still have been your solace: and<br>
Believe&#8217;t not lightly&#8212;though I go alone,<br>
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen<br>
Makes fear&#8217;d and talk&#8217;d of more than seen&#8212;your
son<br>
Will or exceed the common or be caught<br>
With cautelous baits and practise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">My first son.<br>
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius<br>
With thee awhile: determine on some course,<br>
More than a wild exposture to each chance<br>
That starts i&#8217; the way before thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">O the gods!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>

thee<br>
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us<br>
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth<br>
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send<br>
O&#8217;er the vast world to seek a single man,<br>
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool<br>
I&#8217; the absence of the needer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Fare ye well:<br>
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full<br>
Of the wars&#8217; surfeits, to go rove with one<br>
That&#8217;s yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.<br>
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and<br>
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,<br>
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.<br>
While I remain above the ground, you shall<br>
Hear from me still, and never of me aught<br>
But what is like me formerly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s worthily<br>
As any ear can hear. Come, let&#8217;s not weep.<br>

meeting</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I am a Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against &#8217;em: know you me yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Nicanor? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The same, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">You had more beard when I last saw you; but
your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What&#8217;s the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;
the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks
not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The main blaze of it is past, but a small
thing
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Coriolanus banished!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">Banished, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">You will be welcome with this intelligence,
Nicanor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The day serves well for them now. I have heard
it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man&#8217;s wife is
when she&#8217;s fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I shall, between this and supper, tell you
most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">A most royal one; the centurions and their
charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
and to be on foot at an hour&#8217;s warning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am
the
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.</p>

The extreme dangers and the drops of blood<br>
Shed for my thankless country are requited<br>
But with that surname; a good memory,<br>
And witness of the malice and displeasure<br>
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;<br>
The cruelty and envy of the people,<br>
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who<br>
Have all forsook me, hath devour&#8217;d the rest;<br>
And suffer&#8217;d me by the voice of slaves to be<br>
Whoop&#8217;d out of Rome. Now this extremity<br>
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope&#8212;<br>
Mistake me not&#8212;to save my life, for if<br>
I had fear&#8217;d death, of all the men i&#8217; the world<br>
I would have &#8217;voided thee, but in mere spite,<br>
To be full quit of those my banishers,<br>
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast<br>
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge<br>
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims<br>
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,<br>
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it<br>
That my revengeful services may prove<br>
As benefits to thee, for I will fight<br>
Against my canker&#8217;d country with the spleen<br>
Of all the under fiends. But if so be<br>
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes<br>
Thou&#8217;rt tired, then, in a word, I also am<br>
Longer to live most weary, and present<br>
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;<br>
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,<br>
Since I have ever follow&#8217;d thee with hate,<br>
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country&#8217;s breast,<br>
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless<br>
It be to do thee service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">O Marcius, Marcius!<br>
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart<br>
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter<br>
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,<br>
And say &#8217;Tis true,&#8217; I&#8217;ld not believe them
more<br>
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine<br>
Mine arms about that body, where against<br>
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke<br>
And scarr&#8217;d the moon with splinters: here I clip<br>
The anvil of my sword, and do contest<br>
As hotly and as nobly with thy love<br>
As ever in ambitious strength I did<br>
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,<br>
I loved the maid I married; never man<br>
Sigh&#8217;d truer breath; but that I see thee here,<br>
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart<br>
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw<br>
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,<br>
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose<br>
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,<br>
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out<br>
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since<br>
Dreamt of encounters &#8217;twixt thyself and me;<br>
We have been down together in my sleep,<br>
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other&#8217;s throat,<br>
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,<br>
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that<br>
Thou art thence banish&#8217;d, we would muster all<br>
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war<br>
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,<br>
Like a bold flood o&#8217;er-bear. O, come, go in,<br>
And take our friendly senators by the hands;<br>
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,<br>
Who am prepared against your territories,<br>
Though not for Rome itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">You bless me, gods!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt
have<br>
The leading of thine own revenges, take<br>
The one half of my commission; and set down&#8212;<br>
As best thou art experienced, since thou know&#8217;st<br>
Thy country&#8217;s strength and weakness,&#8212;thine own
ways;<br>
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,<br>
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,<br>
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:<br>
Let me commend thee first to those that shall<br>
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!<br>
And more a friend than e&#8217;er an enemy;<br>
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Coriolanus and
Aufidius. The two Servingmen come forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s a strange alteration!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him
with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">What an arm he has! he turned me about with
his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I knew by his face that there was something
in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,&#8212;I
cannot tell how to term it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">He had so; looking as it were&#8212;would I were
hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">So did I, I&#8217;ll be sworn: he is simply the
rarest
man i&#8217; the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you
wot on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Who, my master?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, it&#8217;s no matter for that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Worth six on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say
that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and for an assault too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter third
Servingman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">O slaves, I can tell you news,&#8212; news, you
rascals!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">What, what, what? let&#8217;s partake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had
as
lieve be a condemned man.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore? wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s he that was wont to thwack our
general,<br>
Caius Marcius.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you say &#8217;thwack our general
&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I do not say &#8217;thwack our general;&#8217;
but he was always
good enough for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever
too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">He was too hard for him directly, to say the
troth
on&#8217;t: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">An he had been cannibally given, he might
have
broiled and eaten him too.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But, more of thy news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were
son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o&#8217; the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with&#8217;s hand and
turns up the white o&#8217; the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i&#8217;
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He&#8217;ll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">And he&#8217;s as like to do&#8217;t as any man I
can imagine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Do&#8217;t! he will do&#8217;t; for, look you,
sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he&#8217;s in directitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Directitude! what&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But when they shall see, sir, his crest up
again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But when goes this forward?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have
the
drum struck up this afternoon: &#8217;tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then we shall have a stirring world
again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far
as
day does night; it&#8217;s spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war&#8217;s a destroyer of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be
said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Reason; because they then less need one
another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>

Before you find it other. All the regions<br>
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist<br>

And perish constant fools. Who is&#8217;t can blame him?<br>
Your enemies and his find something in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

The noble man have mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Who shall ask it?<br>
The tribunes cannot do&#8217;t for shame; the people<br>
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf<br>
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they<br>
Should say &#8216;Be good to Rome,&#8217; they charged him even<br>
As those should do that had deserved his hate,<br>
And therein show&#8217;d like enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

And not a hair upon a soldier&#8217;s head<br>
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs<br>
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,<br>

Join&#8217;d in commission with him; but either<br>
Had borne the action of yourself, or else<br>
To him had left it solely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">I understand thee well; and be thou sure,<br>
When he shall come to his account, he knows not<br>
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,<br>
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent<br>
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.<br>
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,<br>
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon<br>
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone<br>
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,<br>
Whene&#8217;er we come to our account.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I beseech you, think you he&#8217;ll carry
Rome?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">All places yield to him ere he sits down;<br>
And the nobility of Rome are his:<br>
The senators and patricians love him too:<br>
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people<br>
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty<br>
To expel him thence. I think he&#8217;ll be to Rome<br>
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br>
By sovereignty of nature. First he was<br>
A noble servant to them; but he could not<br>
Carry his honours even: whether &#8217;twas pride,<br>
Which out of daily fortune ever taints<br>
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,<br>
To fail in the disposing of those chances<br>
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,<br>
Not to be other than one thing, not moving<br>
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace<br>
Even with the same austerity and garb<br>
As he controll&#8217;d the war; but one of these&#8212;<br>
As he hath spices of them all, not all,<br>
For I dare so far free him&#8212;made him fear&#8217;d,<br>
So hated, and so banish&#8217;d: but he has a merit,<br>
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues<br>
Lie in the interpretation of the time:<br>
And power, unto itself most commendable,<br>
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair<br>
To extol what it hath done.<br>
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;<br>
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.<br>
Come, let&#8217;s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,<br>
Thou art poor&#8217;st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</p>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll not go: you hear what he hath
said<br>
Which was sometime his general; who loved him<br>
In a most dear particular. He call&#8217;d me father:<br>
But what o&#8217; that? Go, you that banish&#8217;d him;<br>
A mile before his tent fall down, and knee<br>

<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Yet one time he did call me by my name:<br>
I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops<br>
That we have bled together. Coriolanus<br>
He would not answer to: forbad all names;<br>
He was a kind of nothing, titleless,<br>
Till he had forged himself a name o&#8217; the fire<br>
Of burning Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so: you have made good work!<br>
A pair of tribunes that have rack&#8217;d for Rome,<br>
To make coals cheap,&#8212;a noble memory!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I minded him how royal &#8217;twas to pardon<br>
When it was less expected: he replied,<br>
It was a bare petition of a state<br>
To one whom they had punish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Very well:<br>
Could he say less?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I offer&#8217;d to awaken his regard<br>
For&#8217;s private friends: his answer to me was,<br>
He could not stay to pick them in a pile<br>
Of noisome musty chaff: he said &#8217;twas folly,<br>
For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,<br>
And still to nose the offence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">For one poor grain or two!<br>
I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,<br>
And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:<br>
You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt<br>
Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid<br>
In this so never-needed help, yet do not<br>
Upbraid&#8217;s with our distress. But, sure, if you<br>
Would be your country&#8217;s pleader, your good tongue,<br>
More than the instant army we can make,<br>
Might stop our countryman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll not meddle.</p>

<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Only make trial what your love can do<br>
For Rome, towards Marcius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, and say that Marcius<br>
Return me, as Cominius is return&#8217;d,<br>
Unheard; what then?<br>
But as a discontented friend, grief-shot<br>
With his unkindness? say&#8217;t be so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Yet your good will
must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
As you intended well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll undertake &#8217;t:<br>
I think he&#8217;ll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip<br>
And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.<br>
He was not taken well; he had not dined:<br>
The veins unfill&#8217;d, our blood is cold, and then<br>
We pout upon the morning, are unapt<br>
To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff&#8217;d<br>
These and these conveyances of our blood<br>
With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls<br>
Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I&#8217;ll watch him<br>
Till he be dieted to my request,<br>
And then I&#8217;ll set upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You know the very road into his kindness,<br>
And cannot lose your way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge<br>
Of my success.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye<br>
Red as &#8217;twould burn Rome; and his injury<br>

dismiss&#8217;d me<br>
Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,<br>
He sent in writing after me; what he would not,<br>
Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:<br>
So that all hope is vain.<br>
Unless his noble mother, and his wife;<br>
Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him<br>
For mercy to his country. Therefore, let&#8217;s hence,<br>

And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,<br>
My name hath touch&#8217;d your ears it is Menenius.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name<br>
Is not here passable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, fellow,<br>
The general is my lover: I have been<br>
The book of his good acts, whence men have read<br>
His name unparallel&#8217;d, haply amplified;<br>
For I have ever verified my friends,<br>
Of whom he&#8217;s chief, with all the size that verity<br>
Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,<br>
Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,<br>
I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise<br>
Have almost stamp&#8217;d the leasing: therefore, fellow,<br>
I must have leave to pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in
his
behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, fellow, remember my name is
Menenius,
always factionary on the party of your general.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say
you
have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would
not
speak with him till after dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">You are a Roman, are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I am, as thy general is.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can
you,
when you have pushed out your gates the very
defender of them, and, in a violent popular
ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
front his revenges with the easy groans of old
women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
you out of reprieve and pardon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>

<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Now, you companion, I&#8217;ll say an errand for
you:
You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
with him, if thou standest not i&#8217; the state of
hanging, or of some death more long in
spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
presently, and swoon for what&#8217;s to come upon thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Coriolanus</span></p>
<p class="speech">The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about
thy
particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here&#8217;s
water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
thee; but being assured none but myself could move
thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
here,&#8212;this, who, like a block, hath denied my
access to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">How! away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs<br>
Are servanted to others: though I owe<br>
My revenge properly, my remission lies<br>
In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,<br>
Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather<br>
Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.<br>
Mine ears against your suits are stronger than<br>
Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,<br>
Take this along; I writ it for thy sake</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gives a letter</span></p>
<p class="speech">And would have rent it. Another word,
Menenius,<br>
I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,<br>

<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I neither care for the world nor your general:
for
such things as you, I can scarce think there&#8217;s any,
ye&#8217;re so slight. He that hath a will to die by
himself fears it not from another: let your general
do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
your misery increase with your age! I say to you,

Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
with comforts,<br>
Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;<br>
Making the mother, wife and child to see<br>
The son, the husband and the father tearing<br>

Thine enmity&#8217;s most capital: thou barr&#8217;st us<br>
Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort<br>
That all but we enjoy; for how can we,<br>
Alas, how can we for our country pray.<br>
Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,<br>
Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose<br>
The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,<br>
Our comfort in the country. We must find<br>
An evident calamity, though we had<br>
Our wish, which side should win: for either thou<br>
Must, as a foreign recreant, be led<br>
With manacles thorough our streets, or else<br>
triumphantly tread on thy country&#8217;s ruin,<br>
And bear the palm for having bravely shed<br>
Thy wife and children&#8217;s blood. For myself, son,<br>
I purpose not to wait on fortune till<br>

Rather to show a noble grace to both parts<br>

<p class="speech">Nay, go not from us thus.<br>
If it were so that our request did tend<br>
To save the Romans, thereby to destroy<br>
The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,<br>
As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit<br>
Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces<br>
May say &#8216;This mercy we have show&#8217;d;&#8217; the
Romans,<br>
&#8216;This we received;&#8217; and each in either side<br>
Give the all-hail to thee and cry &#8216;Be blest<br>
For making up this peace!&#8217; Thou know&#8217;st, great son,<br>
The end of war&#8217;s uncertain, but this certain,<br>
That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit<br>
Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,<br>
Whose repetition will be dogg&#8217;d with curses;<br>
Whose chronicle thus writ: &#8216;The man was noble,<br>
But with his last attempt he wiped it out;<br>
Destroy&#8217;d his country, and his name remains<br>
To the ensuing age abhorr&#8217;d.&#8217; Speak to me, son:<br>
Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,<br>
To imitate the graces of the gods;<br>
To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o&#8217; the air,<br>
And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt<br>
That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?<br>
Think&#8217;st thou it honourable for a noble man<br>
Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:<br>
He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:<br>
Perhaps thy childishness will move him more<br>
Than can our reasons. There&#8217;s no man in the world<br>
More bound to &#8217;s mother; yet here he lets me prate<br>
Like one i&#8217; the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life<br>
Show&#8217;d thy dear mother any courtesy,<br>
When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,<br>
Has cluck&#8217;d thee to the wars and safely home,<br>
Loaden with honour. Say my request&#8217;s unjust,<br>
And spurn me back: but if it be not so,<br>
Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,<br>
That thou restrain&#8217;st from me the duty which<br>
To a mother&#8217;s part belongs. He turns away:<br>
Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.<br>
To his surname Coriolanus &#8217;longs more pride<br>
Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;<br>
This is the last: so we will home to Rome,<br>
And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold &#8217;s:<br>
This boy, that cannot tell what he would have<br>
But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,<br>
Does reason our petition with more strength<br>
Than thou hast to deny &#8217;t. Come, let us go:<br>
This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;<br>
His wife is in Corioli and his child<br>
Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:<br>
I am hush&#8217;d until our city be a-fire,<br>
And then I&#8217;ll speak a little.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He holds her by the hand,

<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">O mother, mother!<br>
What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,<br>
The gods look down, and this unnatural scene<br>
They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!<br>
You have won a happy victory to Rome;<br>
But, for your son,&#8212;believe it, O, believe it,<br>
Most dangerously you have with him prevail&#8217;d,<br>
If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.<br>
Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,<br>
I&#8217;ll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,<br>
Were you in my stead, would you have heard<br>
A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>

<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>

Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,<br>
What peace you&#8217;ll make, advise me: for my part,<br>
I&#8217;ll not to Rome, I&#8217;ll back with you; and pray you,<br>
Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!</p>

<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">See you yond coign o&#8217; the Capitol, yond

<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">If it be possible for you to displace it with
your
little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
But I say there is no hope in&#8217;t: our throats are
sentenced and stay upon execution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>

condition of a man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">There is differency between a grub and a
butterfly;
yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
from man to dragon: he has wings; he&#8217;s more than a
creeping thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">He loved his mother dearly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">So did he me: and he no more remembers his
mother
now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
and a heaven to throne in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy
his
mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">The gods be good unto us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">No, in such a case the gods will not be good

us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.</p>

No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.</p>

<p class="speaker">Third Conspirator</p>
<p class="speech">The people will remain uncertain whilst<br>
&#8217;Twixt you there&#8217;s difference; but the fall of
either<br>

<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">I know it;<br>
And my pretext to strike at him admits<br>
A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn&#8217;d<br>
Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten&#8217;d,<br>
He water&#8217;d his new plants with dews of flattery,<br>
Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,<br>

Being banish&#8217;d for&#8217;t, he came unto my hearth;<br>

Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way<br>
In all his own desires; nay, let him choose<br>
Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,<br>
My best and freshest men; served his designments<br>
In mine own person; holp to reap the fame<br>
Which he did end all his; and took some pride<br>
To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,<br>
I seem&#8217;d his follower, not partner, and<br>
He waged me with his countenance, as if<br>
I had been mercenary.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Conspirator</p>

The army marvell&#8217;d at it, and, in the last,<br>

Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting<br>
Under your great command. You are to know<br>
That prosperously I have attempted and<br>
With bloody passage led your wars even to<br>
The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home<br>
Do more than counterpoise a full third part<br>
The charges of the action. We have made peace<br>
With no less honour to the Antiates<br>
Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,<br>
Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,<br>
Together with the seal o&#8217; the senate, what<br>

Breaking his oath and resolution like<br>
A twist of rotten silk, never admitting<br>
Counsel o&#8217; the war, but at his nurse&#8217;s tears<br>
He whined and roar&#8217;d away your victory,<br>
