<h3>Epilogue</h3>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">It is not the fashion to see the lady the
epilogue;
but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
no bush, &#8217;tis true that a good play needs no
epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
and good plays prove the better by the help of good
epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
become me: my way is to conjure you; and I&#8217;ll begin
with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
you bear to women&#8212;as I perceive by your simpering,
none of you hates them&#8212;that between you and the
women the play may please. If I were a woman I
would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.</p>
