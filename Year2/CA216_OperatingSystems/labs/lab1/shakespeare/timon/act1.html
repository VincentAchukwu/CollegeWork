<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Poet, Painter,
Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Good day, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I am glad you&#8217;re well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I have not seen you long: how goes the world?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">It wears, sir, as it grows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that&#8217;s well known:<br>
But what particular rarity? what strange,<br>
Which manifold record not matches? See,<br>
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power<br>
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I know them both; th&#8217; other&#8217;s a
jeweller.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;tis a worthy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s most fix&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">A most incomparable man, breathed, as it
were,<br>
To an untirable and continuate goodness:<br>
He passes.<br>
Jeweller: I have a jewel here&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">O, pray, let&#8217;s see&#8217;t: for the Lord
Timon, sir?<br>
Jeweller: If he will touch the estimate: but, for that&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reciting to himself]</span>
&#8216;When we for recompense have
praised the vile,<br>
It stains the glory in that happy verse<br>
Which aptly sings the good.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a good form.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Looking at the
jewel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">And rich: here is a water, look ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">You are rapt, sir, in some work, some
dedication<br>
To the great lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A thing slipp&#8217;d idly from
me.<br>
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes<br>
From whence &#8217;tis nourish&#8217;d: the fire i&#8217; the
flint<br>
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame<br>
Provokes itself and like the current flies<br>
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.<br>
Let&#8217;s see your piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a good piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">So &#8217;tis: this comes off well and
excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Indifferent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Admirable: how this grace<br>
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power<br>
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination<br>
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture<br>
One might interpret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">It is a pretty mocking of the life.<br>
Here is a touch; is&#8217;t good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I will say of it,<br>
It tutors nature: artificial strife<br>
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter certain Senators, and
pass over</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">How this lord is follow&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Athens: happy man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Look, more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">You see this confluence, this great flood
of visitors.<br>
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,<br>
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug<br>
With amplest entertainment: my free drift<br>
Halts not particularly, but moves itself<br>
In a wide sea of wax: no levell&#8217;d malice<br>
Infects one comma in the course I hold;<br>
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,<br>
Leaving no tract behind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">How shall I understand you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I will unbolt to you.<br>
You see how all conditions, how all minds,<br>
As well of glib and slippery creatures as<br>
Of grave and austere quality, tender down<br>
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune<br>
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging<br>
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance<br>
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer<br>
To Apemantus, that few things loves better<br>
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down<br>
The knee before him, and returns in peace<br>
Most rich in Timon&#8217;s nod.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I saw them speak together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill<br>
Feign&#8217;d Fortune to be throned: the base o&#8217; the
mount<br>
Is rank&#8217;d with all deserts, all kind of natures,<br>
That labour on the bosom of this sphere<br>
To propagate their states: amongst them all,<br>
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix&#8217;d,<br>
One do I personate of Lord Timon&#8217;s frame,<br>
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;<br>
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants<br>
Translates his rivals.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis conceived to scope.<br>
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,<br>
With one man beckon&#8217;d from the rest below,<br>
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount<br>
To climb his happiness, would be well express&#8217;d<br>
In our condition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, sir, but hear me on.<br>
All those which were his fellows but of late,<br>
Some better than his value, on the moment<br>
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,<br>
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,<br>
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him<br>
Drink the free air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, what of these?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood<br>
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants<br>
Which labour&#8217;d after him to the mountain&#8217;s top<br>
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,<br>
Not one accompanying his declining foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis common:<br>
A thousand moral paintings I can show<br>
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune&#8217;s<br>
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well<br>
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen<br>
The foot above the head.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sound. Enter Timon,
addressing himself courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
Ventidius talking with him; Lucilius and other servants
following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Imprison&#8217;d is he, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,<br>
His means most short, his creditors most strait:<br>
Your honourable letter he desires<br>
To those have shut him up; which failing,<br>
Periods his comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Ventidius! Well;<br>
I am not of that feather to shake off<br>
My friend when he must need me. I do know him<br>
A gentleman that well deserves a help:<br>
Which he shall have: I&#8217;ll pay the debt,
and free him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship ever binds him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;<br>
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.<br>
&#8217;Tis not enough to help the feeble up,<br>
But to support him after. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">All happiness to your honour!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an old
Athenian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Timon, hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Freely, good father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I have so: what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Here, at your lordship&#8217;s service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy
creature,<br>
By night frequents my house. I am a man<br>
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;<br>
And my estate deserves an heir more raised<br>
Than one which holds a trencher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well; what further?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">One only daughter have I, no kin else,<br>
On whom I may confer what I have got:<br>
The maid is fair, o&#8217; the youngest for a bride,<br>
And I have bred her at my dearest cost<br>
In qualities of the best. This man of thine<br>
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,<br>
Join with me to forbid him her resort;<br>
Myself have spoke in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">The man is honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore he will be, Timon:<br>
His honesty rewards him in itself;<br>
It must not bear my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Does she love him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">She is young and apt:<br>
Our own precedent passions do instruct us<br>
What levity&#8217;s in youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Lucilius]</span> Love you
the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">If in her marriage my consent be missing,<br>
I call the gods to witness, I will choose<br>
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,<br>
And dispossess her all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How shall she be endow&#8217;d,
if she be mated with an equal husband?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Three talents on the present; in future, all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">This gentleman of mine hath served me long:<br>
To build his fortune I will strain a little,<br>
For &#8217;tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:<br>
What you bestow, in him I&#8217;ll counterpoise,<br>
And make him weigh with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble lord,<br>
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Humbly I thank your lordship: never may<br>
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,<br>
Which is not owed to you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucilius and Old
Athenian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your
lordship!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:<br>
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of painting, which I do beseech<br>
Your lordship to accept.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Painting is welcome.<br>
The painting is almost the natural man;<br>
or since dishonour traffics with man&#8217;s nature,<br>
He is but outside: these pencill&#8217;d figures are<br>
Even such as they give out. I like your work;<br>
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance<br>
Till you hear further from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">The gods preserve ye!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;<br>
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel<br>
Hath suffer&#8217;d under praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">What, my lord! dispraise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">A more satiety of commendations.<br>
If I should pay you for&#8217;t as &#8217;tis extoll&#8217;d,<br>
It would unclew me quite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, &#8217;tis rated<br>
As those which sell would give: but you well know,<br>
Things of like value differing in the owners<br>
Are prized by their masters: believe&#8217;t, dear lord,<br>
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well mock&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; he speaks the common
tongue,<br>
Which all men speak with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Look, who comes here: will you be chid?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Apemantus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Jeweller: We&#8217;ll bear, with your
lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll spare none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good
morrow;<br>
When thou art Timon&#8217;s dog, and these knaves honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou call them knaves? thou
know&#8217;st them not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Are they not Athenians?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Then I repent not.<br>
Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st I do: I call&#8217;d thee by
thy name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art proud, Apemantus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Of nothing so much as that I am not like
Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Whither art going?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">To knock out an honest Athenian&#8217;s
brains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a deed thou&#8217;lt die for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">The best, for the innocence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wrought he not well that painted it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">He wrought better that made the painter; and
yet
he&#8217;s but a filthy piece of work.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re a dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thy mother&#8217;s of my generation: what&#8217;s
she, if I be a dog?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No; I eat not lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">An thou shouldst, thou &#8217;ldst anger
ladies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">O, they eat lords; so they come by great
bellies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a lascivious apprehension.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy
labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost
a
man a doit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou think &#8217;tis worth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">How now, philosopher!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Art not one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Then I lie not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Art not a poet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where
thou
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not feigned; he is so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for
thy
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o&#8217;
the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord
with my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What, thyself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">That I had no angry wit to be a lord.<br>
Art not thou a merchant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Apemantus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">If traffic do it, the gods do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Traffic&#8217;s thy god; and thy god confound
thee!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpet sounds. Enter a
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What trumpet&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,<br>
All of companionship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt some
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">You must needs dine with me: go not you hence<br>
Till I have thank&#8217;d you: when dinner&#8217;s done,<br>
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alcibiades, with the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speech">Most welcome, sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;So, so, there!<br>
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!<br>
That there should be small love &#8217;mongst these
sweet knaves,<br>
And all this courtesy! The strain of man&#8217;s bred out<br>
Into baboon and monkey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed<br>
Most hungerly on your sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Right welcome, sir!<br>
Ere we depart, we&#8217;ll share a bounteous time<br>
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except
Apemantus</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">What time o&#8217; day is&#8217;t, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Time to be honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">That time serves still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">The more accursed thou, that still omitt&#8217;st
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art going to Lord Timon&#8217;s feast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat
fools.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well, fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean
to
give thee none.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Hang thyself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make
thy

<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we
in,<br>
And taste Lord Timon&#8217;s bounty? he outgoes<br>
The very heart of kindness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,<br>
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays<br>
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,<br>
But breeds the giver a return exceeding<br>
All use of quittance.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The noblest mind he carries<br>
That ever govern&#8217;d man.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hautboys playing loud music.
A great banquet served in; Flavius and others attending; then enter
Timon, Alcibiades, Lords, Senators, and Ventidius. Then comes,
dropping, after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like
himself</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">Most honour&#8217;d Timon,<br>
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father&#8217;s age,<br>
And call him to long peace.<br>
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:<br>
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound<br>
To your free heart, I do return those talents,<br>
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help<br>
I derived liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, by no means,<br>
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:<br>
I gave it freely ever; and there&#8217;s none<br>
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:<br>
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare<br>
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">A noble spirit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, my lords,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They all stand ceremoniously
looking on Timon</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ceremony was but devised at first<br>
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,<br>
Recanting goodness, sorry ere &#8217;tis shown;<br>
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.<br>
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes<br>
Than my fortunes to me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They sit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we always have confess&#8217;d it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, ho, confess&#8217;d it! hang&#8217;d it, have
you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No;<br>
You shall not make me welcome:<br>
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, thou&#8217;rt a churl; ye&#8217;ve got a
humour there<br>
Does not become a man: &#8217;tis much to blame.<br>
They say, my lords, &#8216;ira furor brevis est;&#8217; but
yond
man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
he fit for&#8217;t, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come
to
observe; I give thee warning on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I take no heed of thee; thou&#8217;rt an
Athenian,
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I scorn thy meat; &#8217;twould choke me, for I
should
ne&#8217;er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
men eat Timon, and he sees &#8217;em not! It grieves me
to see so many dip their meat in one man&#8217;s blood;
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.<br>
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:<br>
Methinks they should invite them without knives;<br>
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.<br>
There&#8217;s much example for&#8217;t; the fellow that sits
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
man to kill him: &#8217;t has been proved. If I were a
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;<br>
Lest they should spy my windpipe&#8217;s dangerous notes:<br>
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, in heart; and let the health go
round.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Let it flow this way, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his
tides
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill, Timon. Here&#8217;s that which is too weak to
be a sinner, honest water, which ne&#8217;er left man i&#8217; the
mire:<br>
This and my food are equals; there&#8217;s no odds:<br>
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.<br>
Apemantus&#8217; grace.<br>
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;<br>
I pray for no man but myself:<br>
Grant I may never prove so fond,<br>
To trust man on his oath or bond;<br>
Or a harlot, for her weeping;<br>
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:<br>
Or a keeper with my freedom;<br>
Or my friends, if I should need &#8217;em.<br>
Amen. So fall to&#8217;t:<br>
Rich men sin, and I eat root.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Eats and drinks</span></p>
<p class="speech">Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Captain Alcibiades, your heart&#8217;s in the
field now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than
a
dinner of friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there&#8217;s
no meat
like &#8217;em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Would all those fatterers were thine enemies
then,
that then thou mightst kill &#8217;em and bid me to &#8217;em!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that
you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
for ever perfect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
have you that charitable title from thousands, did
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
friends, if we should ne&#8217;er have need of &#8217;em? they
were the most needless creatures living, should we
ne&#8217;er have use for &#8217;em, and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits: and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends? O, what a precious comfort &#8217;tis, to have
so many, like brothers, commanding one another&#8217;s
fortunes! O joy, e&#8217;en made away ere &#8217;t can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
forget their faults, I drink to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Joy had the like conception in our eyes<br>
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Much!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Tucket, within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What means that trump?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, my lord, there are certain
ladies most desirous of admittance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ladies! what are their wills?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">There comes with them a forerunner, my lord,
which
bears that office, to signify their pleasures.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I pray, let them be admitted.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cupid</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cupid</p>
<p class="speech">Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all<br>
That of his bounties taste! The five best senses<br>
Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely<br>
To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th&#8217; ear,<br>
Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;<br>
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">They&#8217;re welcome all; let &#8217;em have
kind admittance:<br>
Music, make their welcome!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Cupid</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">You see, my lord, how ample you&#8217;re
beloved.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music. Re-enter Cupid with a
mask of Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and
playing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this
way!<br>
They dance! they are mad women.<br>
Like madness is the glory of this life.<br>
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.<br>
We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;<br>
And spend our flatteries, to drink those men<br>
Upon whose age we void it up again,<br>
With poisonous spite and envy.<br>
Who lives that&#8217;s not depraved or depraves?<br>
Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves<br>
Of their friends&#8217; gift?<br>
I should fear those that dance before me now<br>
Would one day stamp upon me: &#8217;t has been done;<br>
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Lords rise from table,
with much adoring of Timon; and to show their loves, each singles
out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two
to the hautboys, and cease</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You have done our pleasures much grace, fair
ladies,<br>
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,<br>
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;<br>
You have added worth unto &#8217;t and lustre,<br>
And entertain&#8217;d me with mine own device;<br>
I am to thank you for &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lady</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you take us even at the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would
not hold
taking, I doubt me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:<br>
Please you to dispose yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">All Ladies</p>
<p class="speech">Most thankfully, my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Cupid and
Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Flavius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The little casket bring me
hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!<br>
There is no crossing him in &#8217;s humour;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Else I should tell him,&#8212;well, i&#8217;
faith I should,<br>
When all&#8217;s spent, he &#8217;ld be cross&#8217;d then, an he
could.<br>
&#8217;Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,<br>
That man might ne&#8217;er be wretched for his mind.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Where be our men?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Here, my lord, in readiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Our horses!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Flavius, with the
casket</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O my friends,<br>
I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,<br>
I must entreat you, honour me so much<br>
As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,<br>
Kind my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I am so far already in your gifts,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">So are we all.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, there are certain nobles of the
senate<br>
Newly alighted, and come to visit you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">They are fairly welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your honour,<br>
Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Near! why then, another time I&#8217;ll hear
thee:<br>
I prithee, let&#8217;s be provided to show them
entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I scarce know
how.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Second
Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,<br>
Out of his free love, hath presented to you<br>
Four milk-white horses, trapp&#8217;d in silver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I shall accept them fairly; let the presents<br>
Be worthily entertain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a third
Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, my lord, that honourable
gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
two brace of greyhounds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll hunt with him; and let them be
received,<br>
Not without fair reward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What will this
come to?<br>
He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,<br>
And all out of an empty coffer:<br>
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,<br>
To show him what a beggar his heart is,<br>
Being of no power to make his wishes good:<br>
His promises fly so beyond his state<br>
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes<br>
For every word: he is so kind that he now<br>
Pays interest for &#8217;t; his land&#8217;s put to their
books.<br>
Well, would I were gently put out of office<br>
Before I were forced out!<br>
Happier is he that has no friend to feed<br>
Than such that do e&#8217;en enemies exceed.<br>
I bleed inwardly for my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You do yourselves<br>
Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:<br>
Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">With more than common thanks I will receive
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Lord</p>
<p class="speech">O, he&#8217;s the very soul of bounty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">And now I remember, my lord, you gave<br>
Good words the other day of a bay courser<br>
I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man<br>
Can justly praise but what he does affect:<br>
I weigh my friend&#8217;s affection with mine own;<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you true. I&#8217;ll call to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">All Lords</p>
<p class="speech">O, none so welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I take all and your several visitations<br>
So kind to heart, &#8217;tis not enough to give;<br>
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,<br>
And ne&#8217;er be weary. Alcibiades,<br>
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;<br>
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living<br>
Is &#8217;mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast<br>
Lie in a pitch&#8217;d field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, defiled land, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">We are so virtuously bound&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">And so<br>
Am I to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">So infinitely endear&#8217;d&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">All to you. Lights, more lights!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The best of happiness,<br>
Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ready for his friends.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Apemantus and
Timon</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">What a coil&#8217;s here!<br>
Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!<br>
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums<br>
That are given for &#8217;em. Friendship&#8217;s full of dregs:<br>
Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,<br>
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court&#8217;sies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would
be
good to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll nothing: for if I should be bribed
too,
there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
vain-glories?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I
am
sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
with better music.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">So:<br>
Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:<br>
I&#8217;ll lock thy heaven from thee.<br>
O, that men&#8217;s ears should be<br>
To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!</p>
