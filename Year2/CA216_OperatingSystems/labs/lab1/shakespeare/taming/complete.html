<h4>Scene I. Before an alehouse on a heath.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hostess and
Sly</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll pheeze you, in faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">A pair of stocks, you rogue!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look
in
the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">You will not pay for the glasses you have
burst?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy
cold
bed, and warm thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
third&#8212;borough.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I&#8217;ll
answer him
by law: I&#8217;ll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
and kindly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Falls asleep</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Horns winded. Enter a Lord
from hunting, with his train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my
hounds:<br>
Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss&#8217;d;<br>
And couple Clowder with the deep&#8212;mouth&#8217;d brach.<br>
Saw&#8217;st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good<br>
At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?<br>
I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;<br>
He cried upon it at the merest loss<br>
And twice to-day pick&#8217;d out the dullest scent:<br>
Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,<br>
I would esteem him worth a dozen such.<br>
But sup them well and look unto them all:<br>
To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth
he breathe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm&#8217;d
with ale,<br>
This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!<br>
Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!<br>
Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.<br>
What think you, if he were convey&#8217;d to bed,<br>
Wrapp&#8217;d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,<br>
A most delicious banquet by his bed,<br>
And brave attendants near him when he wakes,<br>
Would not the beggar then forget himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Even as a flattering dream or worthless
fancy.<br>
Then take him up and manage well the jest:<br>
Carry him gently to my fairest chamber<br>
And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:<br>
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters<br>
And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:<br>
Procure me music ready when he wakes,<br>
To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;<br>
And if he chance to speak, be ready straight<br>
And with a low submissive reverence<br>
Say &#8216;What is it your honour will command?&#8217;<br>
Let one attend him with a silver basin<br>
Full of rose-water and bestrew&#8217;d with flowers,<br>
Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,<br>
And say &#8216;Will&#8217;t please your lordship cool your
hands?&#8217;<br>
Some one be ready with a costly suit<br>
And ask him what apparel he will wear;<br>
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,<br>
And that his lady mourns at his disease:<br>
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;<br>
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,<br>
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.<br>
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:<br>
It will be pastime passing excellent,<br>
If it be husbanded with modesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Huntsman</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,<br>
As he shall think by our true diligence<br>
He is no less than what we say he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Take him up gently and to bed with him;<br>
And each one to his office when he wakes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Some bear out Sly. A trumpet
sounds</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, go see what trumpet &#8217;tis that
sounds:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servingman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Belike, some noble gentleman that means,<br>
Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter
Servingman</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! who is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t please your honour, players<br>
That offer service to your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Bid them come near.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Players</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, fellows, you are welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Players</p>
<p class="speech">We thank your honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</p>
<p class="speaker">A Player</p>
<p class="speech">So please your lordship to accept our duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart. This fellow I remember,<br>
Since once he play&#8217;d a farmer&#8217;s eldest son:<br>
&#8217;Twas where you woo&#8217;d the gentlewoman so well:<br>
I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part<br>
Was aptly fitted and naturally perform&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">A Player</p>
<p class="speech">I think &#8217;twas Soto that your honour
means.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true: thou didst it
excellent.<br>
Well, you are come to me in a happy time;<br>
The rather for I have some sport in hand<br>
Wherein your cunning can assist me much.<br>
There is a lord will hear you play to-night:<br>
But I am doubtful of your modesties;<br>
Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,&#8212;<br>
For yet his honour never heard a play&#8212;<br>
You break into some merry passion<br>
And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,<br>
If you should smile he grows impatient.</p>
<p class="speaker">A Player</p>
<p class="speech">Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,<br>
Were he the veriest antic in the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,<br>
And give them friendly welcome every one:<br>
Let them want nothing that my house affords.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit one with the
Players</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, go you to Barthol&#8217;mew my page,<br>
And see him dress&#8217;d in all suits like a lady:<br>
That done, conduct him to the drunkard&#8217;s chamber;<br>
And call him &#8216;madam,&#8217; do him obeisance.<br>
Tell him from me, as he will win my love,<br>
He bear himself with honourable action,<br>
Such as he hath observed in noble ladies<br>
Unto their lords, by them accomplished:<br>
Such duty to the drunkard let him do<br>
With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,<br>
And say &#8216;What is&#8217;t your honour will command,<br>
Wherein your lady and your humble wife<br>
May show her duty and make known her love?&#8217;<br>
And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,<br>
And with declining head into his bosom,<br>
Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy&#8217;d<br>
To see her noble lord restored to health,<br>
Who for this seven years hath esteem&#8217;d him<br>
No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:<br>
And if the boy have not a woman&#8217;s gift<br>
To rain a shower of commanded tears,<br>
An onion will do well for such a shift,<br>
Which in a napkin being close convey&#8217;d<br>
Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.<br>
See this dispatch&#8217;d with all the haste thou canst:<br>
Anon I&#8217;ll give thee more instructions.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit a Servingman</span></p>
<p class="speech">I know the boy will well usurp the grace,<br>
Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:<br>
I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,<br>
And how my men will stay themselves from laughter<br>
When they do homage to this simple peasant.<br>
I&#8217;ll in to counsel them; haply my presence<br>
May well abate the over-merry spleen<br>
Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A bedchamber in the Lord&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter aloft Sly, with
Attendants; some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and
appurtenances; and Lord</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">For God&#8217;s sake, a pot of small ale.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please your lordship drink a cup of
sack?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please your honour taste of these
conserves?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servant</p>
<p class="speech">What raiment will your honour wear to-day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">I am Christophero Sly; call not me
&#8216;honour&#8217; nor
&#8216;lordship:&#8217; I ne&#8217;er drank sack in my life; and
if
you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
beef: ne&#8217;er ask me what raiment I&#8217;ll wear; for I
have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
toes look through the over-leather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!<br>
O, that a mighty man of such descent,<br>
Of such possessions and so high esteem,<br>
Should be infused with so foul a spirit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">What, would you make me mad? Am not I
Christopher
Sly, old Sly&#8217;s son of Burtonheath, by birth a
pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
bestraught: here&#8217;s&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servant</p>
<p class="speech">O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">O, this is it that makes your servants droop!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your
house,<br>
As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.<br>
O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,<br>
Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment<br>
And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.<br>
Look how thy servants do attend on thee,<br>
Each in his office ready at thy beck.<br>
Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">And twenty caged nightingales do sing:<br>
Or wilt thou sleep? we&#8217;ll have thee to a couch<br>
Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed<br>
On purpose trimm&#8217;d up for Semiramis.<br>
Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:<br>
Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp&#8217;d,<br>
Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.<br>
Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar<br>
Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?<br>
Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them<br>
And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as
swift<br>
As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee
straight<br>
Adonis painted by a running brook,<br>
And Cytherea all in sedges hid,<br>
Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,<br>
Even as the waving sedges play with wind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll show thee Io as she was a maid,<br>
And how she was beguiled and surprised,<br>
As lively painted as the deed was done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,<br>
Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,<br>
And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,<br>
So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:<br>
Thou hast a lady far more beautiful<br>
Than any woman in this waning age.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">And till the tears that she hath shed for
thee<br>
Like envious floods o&#8217;er-run her lovely face,<br>
She was the fairest creature in the world;<br>
And yet she is inferior to none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?<br>
Or do I dream? or have I dream&#8217;d till now?<br>
I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;<br>
I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:<br>
Upon my life, I am a lord indeed<br>
And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.<br>
Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;<br>
And once again, a pot o&#8217; the smallest ale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please your mightiness to wash your
hands?<br>
O, how we joy to see your wit restored!<br>
O, that once more you knew but what you are!<br>
These fifteen years you have been in a dream;<br>
Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.<br>
But did I never speak of all that time?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:<br>
For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,<br>
Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;<br>
And rail upon the hostess of the house;<br>
And say you would present her at the leet,<br>
Because she brought stone jugs and no seal&#8217;d quarts:<br>
Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the woman&#8217;s maid of the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,<br>
Nor no such men as you have reckon&#8217;d up,<br>
As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece<br>
And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell<br>
And twenty more such names and men as these<br>
Which never were nor no man ever saw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.</p>

<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">How fares my noble lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>

Where is my wife?</p>

<p class="speech">Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>

My men should call me &#8216;lord:&#8217; I am your goodman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;<br>
I am your wife in all obedience.</p>

<p class="speech">&#8216;Madam,&#8217; and nothing else: so
lords
call ladies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Madam wife, they say that I have
dream&#8217;d<br>
And slept above some fifteen year or more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,<br>
Being all this time abandon&#8217;d from your bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis much. Servants, leave me and her
alone.<br>
Madam, undress you and come now to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you<br>
To pardon me yet for a night or two,<br>
Or, if not so, until the sun be set:<br>
For your physicians have expressly charged,<br>
In peril to incur your former malady,<br>
That I should yet absent me from your bed:<br>
I hope this reason stands for my excuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sly</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucentio and his man
Tranio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Tranio, since for the great desire I had<br>
To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,<br>
I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,<br>
The pleasant garden of great Italy;<br>
And by my father&#8217;s love and leave am arm&#8217;d<br>
With his good will and thy good company,<br>
My trusty servant, well approved in all,<br>
Here let us breathe and haply institute<br>
A course of learning and ingenious studies.<br>
Pisa renown&#8217;d for grave citizens<br>
Gave me my being and my father first,<br>
A merchant of great traffic through the world,<br>
Vincetino come of Bentivolii.<br>
Vincetino&#8217;s son brought up in Florence<br>
It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,<br>
To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:<br>
And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,<br>
Virtue and that part of philosophy<br>
Will I apply that treats of happiness<br>
By virtue specially to be achieved.<br>
Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left<br>
And am to Padua come, as he that leaves<br>
A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep<br>
And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,<br>
I am in all affected as yourself;<br>
Glad that you thus continue your resolve<br>
To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.<br>
Only, good master, while we do admire<br>
This virtue and this moral discipline,<br>
Let&#8217;s be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;<br>
Or so devote to Aristotle&#8217;s cheques<br>
As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:<br>
Balk logic with acquaintance that you have<br>
And practise rhetoric in your common talk;<br>
Music and poesy use to quicken you;<br>
The mathematics and the metaphysics,<br>
Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;<br>
No profit grows where is no pleasure ta&#8217;en:<br>
In brief, sir, study what you most affect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.<br>
If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,<br>
We could at once put us in readiness,<br>
And take a lodging fit to entertain<br>
Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.<br>
But stay a while: what company is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Master, some show to welcome us to town.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Baptista, Katharina,
Bianca, Gremio, and Hortensio. Lucentio and Tranio stand
by</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, importune me no farther,<br>
For how I firmly am resolved you know;<br>
That is, not bestow my youngest daughter<br>
Before I have a husband for the elder:<br>
If either of you both love Katharina,<br>
Because I know you well and love you well,<br>
Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> To cart her
rather: she&#8217;s too rough for me.<br>
There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, is it your will<br>
To make a stale of me amongst these mates?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for
you,<br>
Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;faith, sir, you shall never need to
fear:<br>
I wis it is not half way to her heart;<br>
But if it were, doubt not her care should be<br>
To comb your noddle with a three-legg&#8217;d stool<br>
And paint your face and use you like a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">And me too, good Lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Hush, master! here&#8217;s some good pastime
toward:<br>
That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">But in the other&#8217;s silence do I see<br>
Maid&#8217;s mild behavior and sobriety.<br>
Peace, Tranio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, that I may soon make good<br>
What I have said, Bianca, get you in:<br>
And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,<br>
For I will love thee ne&#8217;er the less, my girl.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">A pretty peat! it is best<br>
Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Sister, content you in my discontent.<br>
Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:<br>
My books and instruments shall be my company,<br>
On them to took and practise by myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, Tranio! thou may&#8217;st hear Minerva
speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?<br>
Sorry am I that our good will effects<br>
Bianca&#8217;s grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why will you mew her up,<br>
Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,<br>
And make her bear the penance of her tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:<br>
Go in, Bianca:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speech">And for I know she taketh most delight<br>
In music, instruments and poetry,<br>
Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,<br>
Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,<br>
Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,<br>
Prefer them hither; for to cunning men<br>
I will be very kind, and liberal<br>
To mine own children in good bringing up:<br>
And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;<br>
For I have more to commune with Bianca.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not?
What,
shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">You may go to the devil&#8217;s dam: your gifts
are so
good, here&#8217;s none will hold you. Their love is not
so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
wish him to her father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I
pray.
Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
that we may yet again have access to our fair
mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco&#8217;s love, to
labour and effect one thing specially.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">A husband! a devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">I say, a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio,
though
her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
to be married to hell?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and
mine
to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
would take her with all faults, and money enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry
with
this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
every morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, as you say, there&#8217;s small choice in
rotten
apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
maintained all by helping Baptista&#8217;s eldest daughter
to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
and then have to&#8217;t a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
How say you, Signior Gremio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">I am agreed; and would I had given him the
best
horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
house of her! Come on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gremio and
Hortensio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible<br>
That love should of a sudden take such hold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">O Tranio, till I found it to be true,<br>
I never thought it possible or likely;<br>
But see, while idly I stood looking on,<br>
I found the effect of love in idleness:<br>
And now in plainness do confess to thee,<br>
That art to me as secret and as dear<br>
As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,<br>
Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,<br>
If I achieve not this young modest girl.<br>
Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;<br>
Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Master, it is no time to chide you now;<br>
Affection is not rated from the heart:<br>
If love have touch&#8217;d you, nought remains but so,<br>
&#8216;Redime te captum quam queas minimo.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:<br>
The rest will comfort, for thy counsel&#8217;s sound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Master, you look&#8217;d so longly on the
maid,<br>
Perhaps you mark&#8217;d not what&#8217;s the pith of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,<br>
Such as the daughter of Agenor had,<br>
That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.<br>
When with his knees he kiss&#8217;d the Cretan strand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Saw you no more? mark&#8217;d you not how her
sister<br>
Began to scold and raise up such a storm<br>
That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move<br>
And with her breath she did perfume the air:<br>
Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then, &#8217;tis time to stir him from his
trance.<br>
I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,<br>
Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:<br>
Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd<br>
That till the father rid his hands of her,<br>
Master, your love must live a maid at home;<br>
And therefore has he closely mew&#8217;d her up,<br>
Because she will not be annoy&#8217;d with suitors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father&#8217;s he!<br>
But art thou not advised, he took some care<br>
To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now &#8217;tis
plotted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">I have it, Tranio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Master, for my hand,<br>
Both our inventions meet and jump in one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me thine first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">You will be schoolmaster<br>
And undertake the teaching of the maid:<br>
That&#8217;s your device.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">It is: may it be done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Not possible; for who shall bear your part,<br>
And be in Padua here Vincentio&#8217;s son,<br>
Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,<br>
Visit his countrymen and banquet them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Basta; content thee, for I have it full.<br>
We have not yet been seen in any house,<br>
Nor can we lie distinguish&#8217;d by our faces<br>
For man or master; then it follows thus;<br>
Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,<br>
Keep house and port and servants as I should:<br>
I will some other be, some Florentine,<br>
Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.<br>
&#8217;Tis hatch&#8217;d and shall be so: Tranio, at once<br>
Uncase thee; take my colour&#8217;d hat and cloak:<br>
When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;<br>
But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">So had you need.<br>
In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,<br>
And I am tied to be obedient;<br>
For so your father charged me at our parting,<br>
&#8216;Be serviceable to my son,&#8217; quoth he,<br>
Although I think &#8217;twas in another sense;<br>
I am content to be Lucentio,<br>
Because so well I love Lucentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:<br>
And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid<br>
Whose sudden sight hath thrall&#8217;d my wounded eye.<br>
Here comes the rogue.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Biondello</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, where have you been?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are
you?
Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
you stolen his? or both? pray, what&#8217;s the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, come hither: &#8217;tis no time to
jest,<br>
And therefore frame your manners to the time.<br>
Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,<br>
Puts my apparel and my countenance on,<br>
And I for my escape have put on his;<br>
For in a quarrel since I came ashore<br>
I kill&#8217;d a man and fear I was descried:<br>
Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,<br>
While I make way from hence to save my life:<br>
You understand me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I, sir! ne&#8217;er a whit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:<br>
Tranio is changed into Lucentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">The better for him: would I were so too!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish
after,<br>
That Lucentio indeed had Baptista&#8217;s youngest daughter.<br>
But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master&#8217;s, I advise<br>
You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:<br>
When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;<br>
But in all places else your master Lucentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Tranio, let&#8217;s go: one thing more rests,

<p class="speech">&#8216;Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto
honorato signor
mio Petruchio.&#8217; Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
this quarrel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;tis no matter, sir, what he
&#8217;leges in Latin.
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
well knock&#8217;d at first, Then had not Grumio come by the
worst.</p>

these
words plain, &#8216;sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
knock me well, and knock me soundly&#8217;? And come you

Why, this&#8217;s a heavy chance &#8217;twixt him and you,<br>
Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.<br>
And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale<br>
Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Such wind as scatters young men through the
world,<br>
To seek their fortunes farther than at home<br>
Where small experience grows. But in a few,<br>
Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:<br>
Antonio, my father, is deceased;<br>
And I have thrust myself into this maze,<br>
Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:<br>
Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,<br>
And so am come abroad to see the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee<br>
And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour&#8217;d wife?<br>
Thou&#8217;ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:<br>
And yet I&#8217;ll promise thee she shall be rich<br>
And very rich: but thou&#8217;rt too much my friend,<br>
And I&#8217;ll not wish thee to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Hortensio, &#8217;twixt such friends as
we<br>
Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know<br>
One rich enough to be Petruchio&#8217;s wife,<br>
As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,<br>
Be she as foul as was Florentius&#8217; love,<br>
As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd<br>
As Socrates&#8217; Xanthippe, or a worse,<br>
She moves me not, or not removes, at least,<br>
Affection&#8217;s edge in me, were she as rough<br>
As are the swelling Adriatic seas:<br>
I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;<br>
If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what
his
mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne&#8217;er
a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
so money comes withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Petruchio, since we are stepp&#8217;d thus far
in,<br>
I will continue that I broach&#8217;d in jest.<br>
I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife<br>
With wealth enough and young and beauteous,<br>
Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:<br>
Her only fault, and that is faults enough,<br>
Is that she is intolerable curst<br>
And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure<br>
That, were my state far worser than it is,<br>
I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Hortensio, peace! thou know&#8217;st not
gold&#8217;s effect:<br>
Tell me her father&#8217;s name and &#8217;tis enough;<br>
For I will board her, though she chide as loud<br>
As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Her father is Baptista Minola,<br>
An affable and courteous gentleman:<br>
Her name is Katharina Minola,<br>
Renown&#8217;d in Padua for her scolding tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I know her father, though I know not her;<br>
And he knew my deceased father well.<br>
I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;<br>
And therefore let me be thus bold with you<br>
To give you over at this first encounter,<br>
Unless you will accompany me thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour
lasts.
O&#8217; my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
would think scolding would do little good upon him:
she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
why, that&#8217;s nothing; an he begin once, he&#8217;ll rail
in
his rope-tricks. I&#8217;ll tell you what sir, an she
stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
her face and so disfigure her with it that she
shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
You know him not, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,<br>
For in Baptista&#8217;s keep my treasure is:<br>
He hath the jewel of my life in hold,<br>
His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,<br>
And her withholds from me and other more,<br>
Suitors to her and rivals in my love,<br>
Supposing it a thing impossible,<br>
For those defects I have before rehearsed,<br>
That ever Katharina will be woo&#8217;d;<br>
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta&#8217;en,<br>
That none shall have access unto Bianca<br>
Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Katharina the curst!<br>
A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,<br>
And offer me disguised in sober robes<br>
To old Baptista as a schoolmaster<br>
Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;<br>
That so I may, by this device, at least<br>
Have leave and leisure to make love to her<br>
And unsuspected court her by herself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s no knavery! See, to beguile the old
folks,
how the young folks lay their heads together!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gremio, and Lucentio
disguised</span></p>
<p class="speech">Master, master, look about you: who goes there,
ha?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.<br>
Petruchio, stand by a while.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">A proper stripling and an amorous!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">O, very well; I have perused the note.<br>
Hark you, sir: I&#8217;ll have them very fairly bound:<br>
All books of love, see that at any hand;<br>
And see you read no other lectures to her:<br>
You understand me: over and beside<br>
Signior Baptista&#8217;s liberality,<br>
I&#8217;ll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,<br>
And let me have them very well perfumed<br>
For she is sweeter than perfume itself<br>
To whom they go to. What will you read to her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Whate&#8217;er I read to her, I&#8217;ll plead
for you<br>
As for my patron, stand you so assured,<br>
As firmly as yourself were still in place:<br>
Yea, and perhaps with more successful words<br>
Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">O this learning, what a thing it is!</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">O this woodcock, what an ass it is!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, sirrah!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.<br>
Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.<br>
I promised to inquire carefully<br>
About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:<br>
And by good fortune I have lighted well<br>
On this young man, for learning and behavior<br>
Fit for her turn, well read in poetry<br>
And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well; and I have met a gentleman<br>
Hath promised me to help me to another,<br>
A fine musician to instruct our mistress;<br>
So shall I no whit be behind in duty<br>
To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">And that his bags shall prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Gremio, &#8217;tis now no time to vent our
love:<br>
Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you news indifferent good for either.<br>
Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,<br>
Upon agreement from us to his liking,<br>
Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,<br>
Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">So said, so done, is well.<br>
Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I know she is an irksome brawling scold:<br>
If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">No, say&#8217;st me so, friend? What
countryman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Born in Verona, old Antonio&#8217;s son:<br>
My father dead, my fortune lives for me;<br>
And I do hope good days and long to see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were
strange!<br>
But if you have a stomach, to&#8217;t i&#8217; God&#8217;s
name:<br>
You shall have me assisting you in all.<br>
But will you woo this wild-cat?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Will I live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Will he woo her? ay, or I&#8217;ll hang her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why came I hither but to that intent?<br>
Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?<br>
Have I not in my time heard lions roar?<br>
Have I not heard the sea puff&#8217;d up with winds<br>
Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?<br>
Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,<br>
And heaven&#8217;s artillery thunder in the skies?<br>
Have I not in a pitched battle heard<br>
Loud &#8217;larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets&#8217; clang?<br>
And do you tell me of a woman&#8217;s tongue,<br>
That gives not half so great a blow to hear<br>
As will a chestnut in a farmer&#8217;s fire?<br>
Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">For he fears none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Hortensio, hark:<br>
This gentleman is happily arrived,<br>
My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">I promised we would be contributors<br>
And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">And so we will, provided that he win her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were as sure of a good dinner.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tranio brave, and
Biondello</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,<br>
Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way<br>
To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">He that has the two fair daughters: is&#8217;t he
you mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Even he, Biondello.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Hark you, sir; you mean not her to&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to
do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I
pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let&#8217;s
away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Well begun, Tranio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, a word ere you go;<br>
Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And if I be, sir, is it any offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">No; if without more words you will get you
hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free<br>
For me as for you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But so is not she.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">For what reason, I beseech you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">For this reason, if you&#8217;ll know,<br>
That she&#8217;s the choice love of Signior Gremio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">That she&#8217;s the chosen of Signior
Hortensio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,<br>
Do me this right; hear me with patience.<br>
Baptista is a noble gentleman,<br>
To whom my father is not all unknown;<br>
And were his daughter fairer than she is,<br>
She may more suitors have and me for one.<br>
Fair Leda&#8217;s daughter had a thousand wooers;<br>
Then well one more may fair Bianca have:<br>
And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,<br>
Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, give him head: I know he&#8217;ll prove a
jade.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Hortensio, to what end are all these words?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,<br>
Did you yet ever see Baptista&#8217;s daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,<br>
The one as famous for a scolding tongue<br>
As is the other for beauteous modesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sir, the first&#8217;s for me; let her go
by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;<br>
And let it be more than Alcides&#8217; twelve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:<br>
The younges t daughter whom you hearken for<br>
Her father keeps from all access of suitors,<br>
And will not promise her to any man<br>
Until the elder sister first be wed:<br>
The younger then is free and not before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">If it be so, sir, that you are the man<br>
Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,<br>
And if you break the ice and do this feat,<br>
Achieve the elder, set the younger free<br>
For our access, whose hap shall be to have her<br>
Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;<br>
And since you do profess to be a suitor,<br>
You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,<br>
To whom we all rest generally beholding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,<br>
Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,<br>
And quaff carouses to our mistress&#8217; health,<br>
And do as adversaries do in law,<br>
Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent motion! Fellows, let&#8217;s be
gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">The motion&#8217;s good indeed and be it so,<br>
Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.</p>

Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong
yourself,<br>
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;<br>
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,<br>
Unbind my hands, I&#8217;ll pull them off myself,<br>
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;<br>
Or what you will command me will I do,<br>
So well I know my duty to my elders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell<br>
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, sister, of all the men alive<br>
I never yet beheld that special face<br>
Which I could fancy more than any other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Minion, thou liest. Is&#8217;t not Hortensio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I&#8217;ll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">O then, belike, you fancy riches more:<br>
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Is it for him you do envy me so?<br>
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive<br>
You have but jested with me all this while:<br>
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes her</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Baptista</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, dame! whence grows this
insolence?<br>
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.<br>
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.<br>
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,<br>
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne&#8217;er wrong thee?<br>
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Her silence flouts me, and I&#8217;ll be
revenged.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flies after Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see<br>
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;<br>
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day<br>
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.<br>
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep<br>
Till I can find occasion of revenge.</p>

Tranio, with Biondello bearing a lute and books</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.<br>
God save you, gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a
daughter<br>
Call&#8217;d Katharina, fair and virtuous?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">You are too blunt: go to it orderly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.<br>
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,<br>
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,<br>
Her affability and bashful modesty,<br>
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,<br>
Am bold to show myself a forward guest<br>
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness<br>
Of that report which I so oft have heard.<br>
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,<br>
I do present you with a man of mine,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Presenting
Hortensio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cunning in music and the mathematics,<br>
To instruct her fully in those sciences,<br>
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:<br>
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:<br>
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re welcome, sir; and he, for your good
sake.<br>
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,<br>
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I see you do not mean to part with her,<br>
Or else you like not of my company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.<br>
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Petruchio is my name; Antonio&#8217;s son,<br>
A man well known throughout all Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I know him well: you are welcome for his
sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,<br>
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:<br>
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be
doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Presenting
Lucentio</span></p>
<p class="speech">that hath been long studying at Rheims; as
cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.<br>
Welcome, good Cambio.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Tranio</span></p>
<p class="speech">But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a
stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,<br>
That, being a stranger in this city here,<br>
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,<br>
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.<br>
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,<br>
In the preferment of the eldest sister.<br>
This liberty is all that I request,<br>
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,<br>
I may have welcome &#8217;mongst the rest that woo<br>
And free access and favour as the rest:<br>
And, toward the education of your daughters,<br>
I here bestow a simple instrument,<br>
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:<br>
If you accept them, then their worth is great.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">A mighty man of Pisa; by report<br>
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,<br>
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;<br>
You shall go see your pupils presently.<br>
Holla, within!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, lead these gentlemen<br>
To my daughters; and tell them both,<br>
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant, with Lucentio
and Hortensio, Biondello following</span></p>
<p class="speech">We will go walk a little in the orchard,<br>
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,<br>
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,<br>
And every day I cannot come to woo.<br>
You knew my father well, and in him me,<br>
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,<br>
Which I have better&#8217;d rather than decreased:<br>
Then tell me, if I get your daughter&#8217;s love,<br>
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">After my death the one half of my lands,<br>
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">And, for that dowry, I&#8217;ll assure her of<br>
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,<br>
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:<br>
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,<br>
That covenants may be kept on either hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, when the special thing is well
obtain&#8217;d,<br>
That is, her love; for that is all in all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,<br>
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;<br>
And where two raging fires meet together<br>
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:<br>
Though little fire grows great with little wind,<br>
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:<br>
So I to her and so she yields to me;<br>
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!<br>
But be thou arm&#8217;d for some unhappy words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,<br>
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Hortensio, with his
head broke</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my friend! why dost thou look so
pale?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">I think she&#8217;ll sooner prove a soldier<br>
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then thou canst not break her to the
lute?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.<br>
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,<br>
And bow&#8217;d her hand to teach her fingering;<br>
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,<br>
&#8216;Frets, call you these?&#8217; quoth she; &#8216;I&#8217;ll
fume
with them:&#8217;<br>
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,<br>
And through the instrument my pate made way;<br>
And there I stood amazed for a while,<br>
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;<br>
While she did call me rascal fiddler<br>
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,<br>
As had she studied to misuse me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;<br>
I love her ten times more than e&#8217;er I did:<br>
O, how I long to have some chat with her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:<br>
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;<br>
She&#8217;s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.<br>
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,<br>
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you do.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Petruchio</span></p>
<p class="speech">I will attend her here,<br>
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.<br>
Say that she rail; why then I&#8217;ll tell her plain<br>
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:<br>
Say that she frown, I&#8217;ll say she looks as clear<br>
As morning roses newly wash&#8217;d with dew:<br>
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;<br>
Then I&#8217;ll commend her volubility,<br>
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:<br>
If she do bid me pack, I&#8217;ll give her thanks,<br>
As though she bid me stay by her a week:<br>
If she deny to wed, I&#8217;ll crave the day<br>
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.<br>
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Katharina</span></p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, Kate; for that&#8217;s your name, I
hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well have you heard, but something hard of
hearing:<br>
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">You lie, in faith; for you are call&#8217;d plain
Kate,<br>
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;<br>
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom<br>
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,<br>
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,<br>
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;<br>
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,<br>
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,<br>
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,<br>
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Moved! in good time: let him that moved you
hither<br>
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first<br>
You were a moveable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s a moveable?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">A join&#8217;d-stool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Women are made to bear, and so are you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">No such jade as you, if me you mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;<br>
For, knowing thee to be but young and light&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Too light for such a swain as you to catch;<br>
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Should be! should&#8212;buzz!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well ta&#8217;en, and like a buzzard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">O slow-wing&#8217;d turtle! shall a buzzard take
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you wasp; i&#8217; faith, you are too
angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">In his tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Whose tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come
again,<br>
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">That I&#8217;ll try.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I swear I&#8217;ll cuff you, if you strike
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">So may you lose your arms:<br>
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;<br>
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">What is your crest? a coxcomb?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so
sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">It is my fashion, when I see a crab.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s no crab; and therefore look not
sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">There is, there is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Then show it me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Had I a glass, I would.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">What, you mean my face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well aim&#8217;d of such a young one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yet you are wither&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis with cares.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I care not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.<br>
&#8217;Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,<br>
And now I find report a very liar;<br>
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,<br>
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:<br>
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,<br>
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,<br>
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,<br>
But thou with mildness entertain&#8217;st thy wooers,<br>
With gentle conference, soft and affable.<br>
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?<br>
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig<br>
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue<br>
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.<br>
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Go, fool, and whom thou keep&#8217;st
command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Did ever Dian so become a grove<br>
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?<br>
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;<br>
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you study all this goodly speech?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">It is extempore, from my mother-wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">A witty mother! witless else her son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not wise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yes; keep you warm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy
bed:<br>
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,<br>
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented<br>
That you shall be my wife; your dowry &#8217;greed on;<br>
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.<br>
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;<br>
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,<br>
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,<br>
Thou must be married to no man but me;<br>
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,<br>
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate<br>
Conformable as other household Kates.<br>
Here comes your father: never make denial;<br>
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Baptista, Gremio,
and Tranio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my
daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">How but well, sir? how but well?<br>
It were impossible I should speed amiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your
dumps?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Call you me daughter? now, I promise you<br>
You have show&#8217;d a tender fatherly regard,<br>
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;<br>
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,<br>
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Father, &#8217;tis thus: yourself and all the
world,<br>
That talk&#8217;d of her, have talk&#8217;d amiss of her:<br>
If she be curst, it is for policy,<br>
For she&#8217;s not froward, but modest as the dove;<br>
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;<br>
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,<br>
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:<br>
And to conclude, we have &#8217;greed so well together,<br>
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see thee hang&#8217;d on Sunday
first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, Petruchio; she says she&#8217;ll see
thee
hang&#8217;d first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our
part!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for
myself:<br>
If she and I be pleased, what&#8217;s that to you?<br>
&#8217;Tis bargain&#8217;d &#8217;twixt us twain, being alone,<br>
That she shall still be curst in company.<br>
I tell you, &#8217;tis incredible to believe<br>
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!<br>
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss<br>
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,<br>
That in a twink she won me to her love.<br>
O, you are novices! &#8217;tis a world to see,<br>
How tame, when men and women are alone,<br>
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.<br>
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,<br>
To buy apparel &#8217;gainst the wedding-day.<br>
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;<br>
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what to say: but give me your
hands;<br>
God send you joy, Petruchio! &#8217;tis a match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;<br>
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:<br>
We will have rings and things and fine array;<br>
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o&#8217;sunday.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Petruchio and
Katharina severally</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Was ever match clapp&#8217;d up so suddenly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant&#8217;s
part,<br>
And venture madly on a desperate mart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:<br>
&#8217;Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.<br>
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:<br>
Now is the day we long have looked for:<br>
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And I am one that love Bianca more<br>
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">But thine doth fry.<br>
Skipper, stand back: &#8217;tis age that nourisheth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">But youth in ladies&#8217; eyes that
flourisheth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this
strife:<br>
&#8217;Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both<br>
That can assure my daughter greatest dower<br>
Shall have my Bianca&#8217;s love.<br>
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">First, as you know, my house within the city<br>
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;<br>
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;<br>
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;<br>
In ivory coffers I have stuff&#8217;d my crowns;<br>
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,<br>
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,<br>
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss&#8217;d with pearl,<br>
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,<br>
Pewter and brass and all things that belong<br>
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm<br>
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,<br>
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,<br>
And all things answerable to this portion.<br>
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;<br>
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,<br>
If whilst I live she will be only mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">That &#8216;only&#8217; came well in. Sir, list
to me:<br>
I am my father&#8217;s heir and only son:<br>
If I may have your daughter to my wife,<br>
I&#8217;ll leave her houses three or four as good,<br>
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one<br>
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;<br>
Besides two thousand ducats by the year<br>
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.<br>
What, have I pinch&#8217;d you, Signior Gremio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Two thousand ducats by the year of land!<br>
My land amounts not to so much in all:<br>
That she shall have; besides an argosy<br>
That now is lying in Marseilles&#8217; road.<br>
What, have I choked you with an argosy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Gremio, &#8217;tis known my father hath no
less<br>
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,<br>
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,<br>
And twice as much, whate&#8217;er thou offer&#8217;st next.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I have offer&#8217;d all, I have no
more;<br>
And she can have no more than all I have:<br>
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then the maid is mine from all the
world,<br>
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I must confess your offer is the best;<br>
And, let your father make her the assurance,<br>
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,<br>
If you should die before him, where&#8217;s her dower?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s but a cavil: he is old, I young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">And may not young men die, as well as old?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well, gentlemen,<br>
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know<br>
My daughter Katharina is to be married:<br>
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca<br>
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;<br>
If not, Signior Gremio:<br>
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, good neighbour.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Baptista</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now I fear thee not:<br>
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool<br>
To give thee all, and in his waning age<br>
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!<br>
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">A vengeance on your crafty wither&#8217;d
hide!<br>
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.<br>
&#8217;Tis in my head to do my master good:<br>
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio<br>
Must get a father, call&#8217;d &#8216;supposed
Vincentio;&#8217;<br>
And that&#8217;s a wonder: fathers commonly<br>
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,<br>
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</p>

Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>

The patroness of heavenly harmony:<br>
Then give me leave to have prerogative;<br>
And when in music we have spent an hour,<br>
Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Preposterous ass, that never read so far<br>
To know the cause why music was ordain&#8217;d!<br>
Was it not to refresh the mind of man<br>
After his studies or his usual pain?<br>
Then give me leave to read philosophy,<br>
And while I pause, serve in your harmony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of

<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,<br>
To strive for that which resteth in my choice:<br>
I am no breeching scholar in the schools;<br>
I&#8217;ll not be tied to hours nor &#8217;pointed times,<br>
But learn my lessons as I please myself.<br>
And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:<br>
Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;<br>
His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll leave his lecture when I am in

<p class="speech">All but the base.</p>

Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,<br>
That I have been thus pleasant with you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">You may go walk, and give me leave a while:<br>
My lessons make no music in three parts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,<br>
Our fine musician groweth amorous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, before you touch the instrument,<br>
To learn the order of my fingering,<br>
I must begin with rudiments of art;<br>
To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,<br>
More pleasant, pithy and effectual,<br>

Lucentio, this is the<br>
&#8217;pointed day.<br>
That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,<br>
And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.<br>
What will be said? what mockery will it be,<br>
To want the bridegroom when the priest attends<br>
To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!<br>
What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be
forced<br>
To give my hand opposed against my heart<br>
Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;<br>
Who woo&#8217;d in haste and means to wed at leisure.<br>
I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,<br>
Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:<br>
And, to be noted for a merry man,<br>
He&#8217;ll woo a thousand, &#8217;point the day of marriage,<br>
Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;<br>
Yet never means to wed where he hath woo&#8217;d.<br>
Now must the world point at poor Katharina,<br>
And say, &#8216;Lo, there is mad Petruchio&#8217;s wife,<br>
If it would please him come and marry her!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.<br>
Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,<br>
Whatever fortune stays him from his word:<br>
Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;<br>
Though he be merry, yet withal he&#8217;s honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Would Katharina had never seen him though!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit weeping, followed by
Bianca and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>

Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.</p>

<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Master, master! news, old news, and such news
as
you never heard of!</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Is it new and old too? how may that be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio&#8217;s
coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Is he come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">He is coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">When will he be here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">When he stands where I am and sees you there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">But say, what to thine old news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an
old
jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
another laced, an old rusty sword ta&#8217;en out of the
town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
six time pieced and a woman&#8217;s crupper of velure,
which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Who comes with him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, his lackey, for all the world
caparisoned
like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
and blue list; an old hat and &#8216;the humour of forty
fancies&#8217; pricked in&#8217;t for a feather: a monster, a
very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
footboy or a gentleman&#8217;s lackey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis some odd humour pricks him to this
fashion;<br>
Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad he&#8217;s come, howsoe&#8217;er he
comes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, he comes not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou not say he comes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Who? that Petruchio came?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that Petruchio came.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his
back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s all one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, by Saint Jamy,<br>
I hold you a penny,<br>
A horse and a man<br>
Is more than one,<br>
And yet not many.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Petruchio and
Grumio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, where be these gallants? who&#8217;s at
home?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">You are welcome, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I come not well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">And yet you halt not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Not so well apparell&#8217;d<br>
As I wish you were.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Were it better, I should rush in thus.<br>
But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?<br>
How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:<br>
And wherefore gaze this goodly company,<br>
As if they saw some wondrous monument,<br>
Some comet or unusual prodigy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:<br>
First were we sad, fearing you would not come;<br>
Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.<br>
Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,<br>
An eye-sore to our solemn festival!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And tells us, what occasion of import<br>
Hath all so long detain&#8217;d you from your wife,<br>
And sent you hither so unlike yourself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:<br>
Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,<br>
Though in some part enforced to digress;<br>
Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse<br>
As you shall well be satisfied withal.<br>
But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:<br>
The morning wears, &#8217;tis time we were at church.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">See not your bride in these unreverent robes:<br>
Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, believe me: thus I&#8217;ll visit her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha&#8217; done
with words:<br>
To me she&#8217;s married, not unto my clothes:<br>
Could I repair what she will wear in me,<br>
As I can change these poor accoutrements,<br>
&#8217;Twere well for Kate and better for myself.<br>
But what a fool am I to chat with you,<br>
When I should bid good morrow to my bride,<br>
And seal the title with a lovely kiss!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Petruchio and
Grumio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">He hath some meaning in his mad attire:<br>
We will persuade him, be it possible,<br>
To put on better ere he go to church.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll after him, and see the event of
this.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Baptista, Gremio, and
attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">But to her love concerneth us to add<br>
Her father&#8217;s liking: which to bring to pass,<br>
As I before unparted to your worship,<br>
I am to get a man,&#8212;whate&#8217;er he be,<br>
It skills not much. we&#8217;ll fit him to our turn,&#8212;<br>
And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;<br>
And make assurance here in Padua<br>
Of greater sums than I have promised.<br>
So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,<br>
And marry sweet Bianca with consent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Were it not that my fellow-school-master<br>
Doth watch Bianca&#8217;s steps so narrowly,<br>
&#8217;Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;<br>
Which once perform&#8217;d, let all the world say no,<br>
I&#8217;ll keep mine own, despite of all the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">That by degrees we mean to look into,<br>
And watch our vantage in this business:<br>
We&#8217;ll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,<br>
The narrow-prying father, Minola,<br>

school.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">A bridegroom say you? &#8217;tis a groom
indeed,<br>
A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Curster than she? why, &#8217;tis impossible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Why he&#8217;s a devil, a devil, a very
fiend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she&#8217;s a devil, a devil, the
devil&#8217;s dam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, she&#8217;s a lamb, a dove, a fool to
him!<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest<br>
Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,<br>
&#8216;Ay, by gogs-wouns,&#8217; quoth he; and swore so loud,<br>
That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;<br>
And, as he stoop&#8217;d again to take it up,<br>
The mad-brain&#8217;d bridegroom took him such a cuff<br>
That down fell priest and book and book and priest:<br>
&#8216;Now take them up,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;if any
list.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">What said the wench when he rose again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp&#8217;d and
swore,<br>
As if the vicar meant to cozen him.<br>
But after many ceremonies done,<br>
He calls for wine: &#8216;A health!&#8217; quoth he, as if<br>
He had been aboard, carousing to his mates<br>
After a storm; quaff&#8217;d off the muscadel<br>
And threw the sops all in the sexton&#8217;s face;<br>
Having no other reason<br>
But that his beard grew thin and hungerly<br>
And seem&#8217;d to ask him sops as he was drinking.<br>
This done, he took the bride about the neck<br>
And kiss&#8217;d her lips with such a clamorous smack<br>
That at the parting all the church did echo:<br>
And I seeing this came thence for very shame;<br>
And after me, I know, the rout is coming.<br>
Such a mad marriage never was before:<br>
Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.</p>

And, honest company, I thank you all,<br>

man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent

hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my

<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore &#8217;tis called a sensible tale:
and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Both of one horse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Why, a horse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed
me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all
shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master&#8217;s horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">They are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Call them forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she hath a face of her own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Who knows not that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.</p>

That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites<br>
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.<br>
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;<br>
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;<br>
As with the meat, some undeserved fault<br>

That all is done in reverend care of her;<br>
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:<br>
And if she chance to nod I&#8217;ll rail and brawl<br>

That I have fondly flatter&#8217;d her withal.</p>

You might have heard it else proclaim&#8217;d about.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;<br>
For I have bills for money by exchange<br>
From Florence and must here deliver them.</p>

This will I do, and this I will advise you:<br>
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?</p>

Pisa renowned for grave citizens.</p>

In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.</p>

This favour will I do you for his sake;<br>
And think it not the worst of an your fortunes<br>
That you are like to Sir Vincentio.<br>
His name and credit shall you undertake,<br>
And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:<br>
Look that you take upon you as you should;<br>
You understand me, sir: so shall you stay<br>
Till you have done your business in the city:<br>
If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, I do; and will repute you ever<br>
The patron of my life and liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Then go with me to make the matter good.<br>
This, by the way, I let you understand;<br>
My father is here look&#8217;d for every day,<br>

And revel it as bravely as the best,<br>
With silken coats and caps and golden rings,<br>
With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;<br>
With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,<br>
With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.<br>
What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,<br>
To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tailor</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;<br>
Lay forth the gown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Haberdasher</span></p>
<p class="speech">What news with you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Haberdasher</p>
<p class="speech">Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this was moulded on a porringer;<br>
A velvet dish: fie, fie! &#8217;tis lewd and filthy:<br>
Why, &#8217;tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,<br>
A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby&#8217;s cap:<br>
Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have no bigger: this doth fit the
time,<br>
And gentlewomen wear such caps as these</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">When you are gentle, you shall have one too,<br>
And not till then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> That will not
be in haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;<br>
And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:<br>
Your betters have endured me say my mind,<br>
And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.<br>
My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,<br>
Or else my heart concealing it will break,<br>
And rather than it shall, I will be free<br>
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou say&#8217;st true; it is a paltry
cap,<br>
A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:<br>
I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Love me or love me not, I like the cap;<br>
And it I will have, or I will have none.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Haberdasher</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us
see&#8217;t.<br>
O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?<br>
What&#8217;s this? a sleeve? &#8217;tis like a demi-cannon:<br>
What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?<br>
Here&#8217;s snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,<br>
Like to a censer in a barber&#8217;s shop:<br>
Why, what, i&#8217; devil&#8217;s name, tailor, call&#8217;st thou
this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I see
she&#8217;s like to have neither cap nor gown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">You bid me make it orderly and well,<br>
According to the fashion and the time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, and did; but if you be
remember&#8217;d,<br>
I did not bid you mar it to the time.<br>
Go, hop me over every kennel home,<br>
For you shall hop without my custom, sir:<br>
I&#8217;ll none of it: hence! make your best of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I never saw a better-fashion&#8217;d gown,<br>
More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:<br>
Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">She says your worship means to make
a puppet of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou
thread,
thou thimble,<br>
Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!<br>
Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!<br>
Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?<br>
Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;<br>
Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard<br>
As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!<br>
I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr&#8217;d her gown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">Your worship is deceived; the gown is made<br>
Just as my master had direction:<br>
Grumio gave order how it should be done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">But how did you desire it should be made?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, with needle and thread.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">But did you not request to have it cut?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast faced many things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave
not
me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here is the note of the fashion to
testify</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Read it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">The note lies in&#8217;s throat, if he say I said
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me
in
the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
of brown thread: I said a gown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Proceed.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;With a

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;With a

<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there&#8217;s the villany.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Error i&#8217; the bill, sir; error i&#8217; the
bill.
I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
sewed up again; and that I&#8217;ll prove upon thee,
though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tailor</p>
<p class="speech">This is true that I say: an I had thee
in place where, thou shouldst know it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">I am for thee straight: take thou the
bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no
odds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">You are i&#8217; the right, sir: &#8217;tis for
my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Go, take it up unto thy master&#8217;s use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, not for thy life: take up my
mistress&#8217;
gown for thy master&#8217;s use!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, what&#8217;s your conceit in that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think
for:<br>
Take up my mistress&#8217; gown to his master&#8217;s use!<br>
O, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>

I pray you stand good father to me now,<br>
Give me Bianca for my patrimony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Soft son!<br>
Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua<br>
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio<br>
Made me acquainted with a weighty cause<br>
Of love between your daughter and himself:<br>
And, for the good report I hear of you<br>
And for the love he beareth to your daughter<br>
And she to him, to stay him not too long,<br>
I am content, in a good father&#8217;s care,<br>
To have him match&#8217;d; and if you please to like<br>
No worse than I, upon some agreement<br>
Me shall you find ready and willing<br>
With one consent to have her so bestow&#8217;d;<br>
For curious I cannot be with you,<br>
Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:<br>
Your plainness and your shortness please me well.<br>
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here<br>
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,<br>
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:<br>
And therefore, if you say no more than this,<br>
That like a father you will deal with him<br>
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,<br>
The match is made, and all is done:<br>
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best<br>
We be affied and such assurance ta&#8217;en<br>
As shall with either part&#8217;s agreement stand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,<br>
Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:<br>
Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;<br>
And happily we might be interrupted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Then at my lodging, an it like you:<br>
There doth my father lie; and there, this night,<br>
We&#8217;ll pass the business privately and well.<br>
Send for your daughter by your servant here:<br>
My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.<br>
The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,<br>
You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,<br>
And bid Bianca make her ready straight;<br>
And, if you will, tell what hath happened,<br>
Lucentio&#8217;s father is arrived in Padua,<br>
And how she&#8217;s like to be Lucentio&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>

<p class="speech">Biondello, what of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind,
to
expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, moralize them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
deceiving father of a deceitful son.</p>

your
command at all hours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">And what of all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
&#8216;cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:&#8217; to the
church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
ever and a day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Hearest thou, Biondello?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
Luke&#8217;s, to bid the priest be ready to come against

behind Biondello, Lucentio, and Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is
ready.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need
thee
at home; therefore leave us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, faith, I&#8217;ll see the church o&#8217;
your back; and
then come back to my master&#8217;s as soon as I can.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucentio, Bianca, and
Biondello</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Petruchio, Katharina,
Vincentio, Grumio, with Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, here&#8217;s the door, this is
Lucentio&#8217;s house:<br>
My father&#8217;s bears more toward the market-place;<br>
Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not choose but drink before you go:<br>
I think I shall command your welcome here,<br>
And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Knocks</span></p>

louder.</p>

<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he that knocks as he would beat down
the gate?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s within, sir, but not to be spoken
withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two,
to
make merry withal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he
shall
need none, so long as I live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in
Padua.
Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and
here
looking out at the window.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou his father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Vincentio]</span> Why,
how now, gentleman! why, this

<p class="speech">What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O
immortal
gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I

<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>

<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What, is the man lunatic?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by
your

what &#8217;cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in
Bergamo.</p>

<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">His name! as if I knew not his name: I have
brought
him up ever since he was three years old, and his
name is Tranio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he
is
mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay
hold

<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Cambio is changed into Lucentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Love wrought these miracles. Bianca&#8217;s
love<br>

What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;<br>
Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.</p>

Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Widow</p>
<p class="speech">Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,<br>
Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">I would your duty were as foolish too:<br>
The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,<br>
Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">The more fool you, for laying on my duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong
women<br>
What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Widow</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you&#8217;re mocking: we will have no
telling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Widow</p>
<p class="speech">She shall not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I say she shall: and first begin with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind
brow,<br>
And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,<br>
To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:<br>
It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,<br>
Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,<br>
And in no sense is meet or amiable.<br>
A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,<br>
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;<br>
And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty<br>
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.<br>
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,<br>
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,<br>
And for thy maintenance commits his body<br>
To painful labour both by sea and land,<br>
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,<br>
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;<br>
And craves no other tribute at thy hands<br>
But love, fair looks and true obedience;<br>
Too little payment for so great a debt.<br>
Such duty as the subject owes the prince<br>
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;<br>
And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,<br>
And not obedient to his honest will,<br>
What is she but a foul contending rebel<br>
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?<br>
I am ashamed that women are so simple<br>
To offer war where they should kneel for peace;<br>
Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,<br>
When they are bound to serve, love and obey.<br>
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,<br>
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,<br>
But that our soft conditions and our hearts<br>
Should well agree with our external parts?<br>
Come, come, you froward and unable worms!<br>
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,<br>
My heart as great, my reason haply more,<br>
To bandy word for word and frown for frown;<br>
But now I see our lances are but straws,<br>
Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,<br>
That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.<br>
Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,<br>
And place your hands below your husband&#8217;s foot:<br>
In token of which duty, if he please,<br>
My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there&#8217;s a wench! Come on, and kiss me,
Kate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt
ha&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a good hearing when children are
toward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Kate, we&#8217;ll to bed.<br>
We three are married, but you two are sped.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lucentio</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas I won the wager, though you hit the
white;<br>
And, being a winner, God give you good night!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Petruchio and
Katharina</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst
shrew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be
tamed so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
