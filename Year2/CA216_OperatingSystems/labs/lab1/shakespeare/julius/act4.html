<h4>Scene I. A house in Rome.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Antony, Octavius, and
Lepidus, seated at a table</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">These many, then, shall die; their names are
prick&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Your brother too must die; consent you,
Lepidus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">I do consent&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Prick him down, Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon condition Publius shall not live,<br>
Who is your sister&#8217;s son, Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn
him.<br>
But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar&#8217;s house;<br>
Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine<br>
How to cut off some charge in legacies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall I find you here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Or here, or at the Capitol.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Lepidus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">This is a slight unmeritable man,<br>
Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,<br>
The three-fold world divided, he should stand<br>
One of the three to share it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">So you thought him;<br>
And took his voice who should be prick&#8217;d to die,<br>
In our black sentence and proscription.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Octavius, I have seen more days than you:<br>
And though we lay these honours on this man,<br>
To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,<br>
He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,<br>
To groan and sweat under the business,<br>
Either led or driven, as we point the way;<br>
And having brought our treasure where we will,<br>
Then take we down his load, and turn him off,<br>
Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,<br>
And graze in commons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">You may do your will;<br>
But he&#8217;s a tried and valiant soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">So is my horse, Octavius; and for that<br>
I do appoint him store of provender:<br>
It is a creature that I teach to fight,<br>
To wind, to stop, to run directly on,<br>
His corporal motion govern&#8217;d by my spirit.<br>
And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;<br>
He must be taught and train&#8217;d and bid go forth;<br>
A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds<br>
On abjects, orts and imitations,<br>
Which, out of use and staled by other men,<br>
Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,<br>
But as a property. And now, Octavius,<br>
Listen great things:&#8212;Brutus and Cassius<br>
Are levying powers: we must straight make head:<br>
Therefore let our alliance be combined,<br>
Our best friends made, our means stretch&#8217;d<br>
And let us presently go sit in council,<br>
How covert matters may be best disclosed,<br>
And open perils surest answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius</p>
<p class="speech">Let us do so: for we are at the stake,<br>
And bay&#8217;d about with many enemies;<br>
And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,<br>
Millions of mischiefs.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Camp near Sardis. Before Brutus&#8217;s tent.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum. Enter Brutus, Lucilius,
Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and Pindarus meeting them</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Give the word, ho! and stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">He is at hand; and Pindarus is come<br>
To do you salutation from his master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,<br>
In his own change, or by ill officers,<br>
Hath given me some worthy cause to wish<br>
Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,<br>
I shall be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pindarus</p>
<p class="speech">I do not doubt<br>
But that my noble master will appear<br>
Such as he is, full of regard and honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;<br>
How he received you, let me be resolved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">With courtesy and with respect enough;<br>
But not with such familiar instances,<br>
Nor with such free and friendly conference,<br>
As he hath used of old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast described<br>
A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,<br>
When love begins to sicken and decay,<br>
It useth an enforced ceremony.<br>
There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;<br>
But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,<br>
Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;<br>
But when they should endure the bloody spur,<br>
They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,<br>
Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">They mean this night in Sardis to be
quarter&#8217;d;<br>
The greater part, the horse in general,<br>
Are come with Cassius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Hark! he is arrived.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Low march within</span></p>
<p class="speech">March gently on to meet him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassius and his
powers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, ho! Speak the word along.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Stand!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Stand!</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Stand!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?<br>
And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Brutus, this sober form of yours hides
wrongs;<br>
And when you do them&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Cassius, be content.<br>
Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.<br>
Before the eyes of both our armies here,<br>
Which should perceive nothing but love from us,<br>
Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;<br>
Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,<br>
And I will give you audience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Pindarus,<br>
Bid our commanders lead their charges off<br>
A little from this ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man<br>
Come to our tent till we have done our conference.<br>
Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.</p>

<h4>Scene III. Brutus&#8217;s tent.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Brutus and
Cassius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">That you have wrong&#8217;d me doth appear in
this:<br>
You have condemn&#8217;d and noted Lucius Pella<br>
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;<br>
Wherein my letters, praying on his side,<br>
Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You wronged yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">In such a time as this it is not meet<br>
That every nice offence should bear his comment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself<br>
Are much condemn&#8217;d to have an itching palm;<br>
To sell and mart your offices for gold<br>
To undeservers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I an itching palm!<br>
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,<br>
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The name of Cassius honours this corruption,<br>
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Chastisement!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Remember March, the ides of March remember:<br>
Did not great Julius bleed for justice&#8217; sake?<br>
What villain touch&#8217;d his body, that did stab,<br>
And not for justice? What, shall one of us<br>
That struck the foremost man of all this world<br>
But for supporting robbers, shall we now<br>
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,<br>
And sell the mighty space of our large honours<br>
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?<br>
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,<br>
Than such a Roman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Brutus, bay not me;<br>
I&#8217;ll not endure it: you forget yourself,<br>
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,<br>
Older in practise, abler than yourself<br>
To make conditions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; you are not, Cassius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I say you are not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;<br>
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Away, slight man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Hear me, for I will speak.<br>
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?<br>
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart
break;<br>
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,<br>
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?<br>
Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch<br>
Under your testy humour? By the gods<br>
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,<br>
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,<br>
I&#8217;ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,<br>
When you are waspish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Is it come to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You say you are a better soldier:<br>
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,<br>
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,<br>
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;<br>
I said, an elder soldier, not a better:<br>
Did I say &#8216;better&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">If you did, I care not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I durst not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">What, durst not tempt him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">For your life you durst not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Do not presume too much upon my love;<br>
I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You have done that you should be sorry for.<br>
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,<br>
For I am arm&#8217;d so strong in honesty<br>
That they pass by me as the idle wind,<br>
Which I respect not. I did send to you<br>
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:<br>
For I can raise no money by vile means:<br>
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,<br>
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring<br>
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash<br>
By any indirection: I did send<br>
To you for gold to pay my legions,<br>
Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?<br>
Should I have answer&#8217;d Caius Cassius so?<br>
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,<br>
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,<br>
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;<br>
Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I denied you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I did not: he was but a fool that brought<br>
My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:<br>
A friend should bear his friend&#8217;s infirmities,<br>
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">You love me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I do not like your faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">A flatterer&#8217;s would not, though they do
appear<br>
As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,<br>
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,<br>
For Cassius is aweary of the world;<br>
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;<br>
Cheque&#8217;d like a bondman; all his faults observed,<br>
Set in a note-book, learn&#8217;d, and conn&#8217;d by rote,<br>
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep<br>
My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,<br>
And here my naked breast; within, a heart<br>
Dearer than Plutus&#8217; mine, richer than gold:<br>
If that thou be&#8217;st a Roman, take it forth;<br>
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:<br>
Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,<br>
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better<br>
Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Sheathe your dagger:<br>
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;<br>
Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.<br>
O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<br>
That carries anger as the flint bears fire;<br>
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,<br>
And straight is cold again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Hath Cassius lived<br>
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br>
When grief, and blood ill-temper&#8217;d, vexeth him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&#8217;d
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">And my heart too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O Brutus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Have not you love enough to bear with me,<br>
When that rash humour which my mother gave me<br>
Makes me forgetful?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,<br>
When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br>
He&#8217;ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>

<p class="speech">For shame, you generals! what do you mean?<br>
Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;<br>
For I have seen more years, I&#8217;m sure, than ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Bear with him, Brutus; &#8217;tis his

<p class="speech">O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Of your philosophy you make no use,<br>
If you give place to accidental evils.</p>

<p class="speech">Ha! Portia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">She is dead.</p>

you so?<br>
O insupportable and touching loss!<br>
Upon what sickness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Impatient of my absence,<br>
And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony<br>
Have made themselves so strong:&#8212;for with her death<br>

Fill, Lucius, till the wine o&#8217;erswell the cup;<br>

<p class="speech">Welcome, good Messala.<br>
Now sit we close about this taper here,<br>
And call in question our necessities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Portia, art thou gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No more, I pray you.<br>
Messala, I have here received letters,<br>
That young Octavius and Mark Antony<br>
Come down upon us with a mighty power,<br>
Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">With what addition?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">That by proscription and bills of outlawry,<br>
Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,<br>
Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Therein our letters do not well agree;<br>
Mine speak of seventy senators that died<br>
By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Cicero one!</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Cicero is dead,<br>
And by that order of proscription.<br>
Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Messala.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, Messala.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That, methinks, is strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:<br>
For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:<br>
With meditating that she must die once,<br>
I have the patience to endure it now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I have as much of this in art as you,<br>
But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br>
Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I do not think it good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">This it is:<br>
&#8217;Tis better that the enemy seek us:<br>
So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,<br>
Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,<br>
Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Good reasons must, of force, give place to
better.<br>
The people &#8217;twixt Philippi and this ground<br>
Do stand but in a forced affection;<br>
For they have grudged us contribution:<br>
The enemy, marching along by them,<br>
By them shall make a fuller number up,<br>
Come on refresh&#8217;d, new-added, and encouraged;<br>
From which advantage shall we cut him off,<br>
If at Philippi we do face him there,<br>
These people at our back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, good brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Under your pardon. You must note beside,<br>
That we have tried the utmost of our friends,<br>
Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:<br>
The enemy increaseth every day;<br>
We, at the height, are ready to decline.<br>
There is a tide in the affairs of men,<br>
Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;<br>
Omitted, all the voyage of their life<br>
Is bound in shallows and in miseries.<br>
On such a full sea are we now afloat;<br>
And we must take the current when it serves,<br>
Or lose our ventures.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Then, with your will, go on;<br>
We&#8217;ll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The deep of night is crept upon our talk,<br>
And nature must obey necessity;<br>
Which we will niggard with a little rest.<br>
There is no more to say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">No more. Good night:<br>
Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Lucius!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speech">My gown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, good Messala:<br>
Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,<br>
Good night, and good repose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">O my dear brother!<br>
This was an ill beginning of the night:<br>
Never come such division &#8217;tween our souls!<br>
Let it not, Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Every thing is well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, good brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titinius</p>
<p class="speaker">Messala</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, Lord Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, every one.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucius, with the
gown</span></p>
<p class="speech">Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Here in the tent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What, thou speak&#8217;st
drowsily?<br>
Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art
o&#8217;er-watch&#8217;d.<br>
Call Claudius and some other of my men:<br>
I&#8217;ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Varro and Claudius!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Varro and
Claudius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speech">Calls my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;<br>
It may be I shall raise you by and by<br>
On business to my brother Cassius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speech">So please you, we will stand and watch your
pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;<br>
It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.<br>
Look, Lucius, here&#8217;s the book I sought for so;<br>
I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Varro and Claudius lie
down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I was sure your lordship did not give it me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.<br>
Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,<br>
And touch thy instrument a strain or two?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord, an&#8217;t please you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">It does, my boy:<br>
I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">It is my duty, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I should not urge thy duty past thy might;<br>
I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;<br>
I will not hold thee long: if I do live,<br>
I will be good to thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music, and a song</span></p>
<p class="speech">This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,<br>
Lay&#8217;st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,<br>
That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;<br>
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:<br>
If thou dost nod, thou break&#8217;st thy instrument;<br>
I&#8217;ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.<br>
Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn&#8217;d down<br>
Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Ghost of
Caesar</span></p>
<p class="speech">How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?<br>
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br>
That shapes this monstrous apparition.<br>
It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?<br>
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,<br>
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?<br>
Speak to me what thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why comest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Well; then I shall see thee again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, at Philippi.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:<br>
Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.<br>
Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">The strings, my lord, are false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He thinks he still is at his instrument.<br>
Lucius, awake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst
out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any
thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Varro</span></p>
<p class="speech">Fellow thou, awake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Did we, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay: saw you any thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord, I saw nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;<br>
Bid him set on his powers betimes before,<br>
And we will follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Varro</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">It shall be done, my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
