"SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.">
<h4>SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Senior, Amiens,
and two or three Lords, like foresters</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,<br>
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet<br>
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods<br>
More free from peril than the envious court?<br>
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,<br>
The seasons&#8217; difference, as the icy fang<br>
And churlish chiding of the winter&#8217;s wind,<br>
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,<br>
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say<br>
&#8216;This is no flattery: these are counsellors<br>
That feelingly persuade me what I am.&#8217;<br>
Sweet are the uses of adversity,<br>
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,<br>
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;<br>
And this our life exempt from public haunt<br>
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,<br>
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.<br>
I would not change it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Amiens</p>
<p class="speech">Happy is your grace,<br>
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune<br>
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Come, shall we go and kill us venison?<br>
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,<br>
Being native burghers of this desert city,<br>
Should in their own confines with forked heads<br>
Have their round haunches gored.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord,<br>
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,<br>
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp<br>
Than doth your brother that hath banish&#8217;d you.<br>
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself<br>
Did steal behind him as he lay along<br>
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out<br>
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:<br>
To the which place a poor sequester&#8217;d stag,<br>
That from the hunter&#8217;s aim had ta&#8217;en a hurt,<br>
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,<br>
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans<br>
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat<br>
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears<br>
Coursed one another down his innocent nose<br>
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool<br>
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,<br>
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,<br>
Augmenting it with tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">But what said Jaques?<br>
Did he not moralize this spectacle?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, into a thousand similes.<br>
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;<br>
&#8216;Poor deer,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;thou makest a
testament<br>
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more<br>
To that which had too much:&#8217; then, being there alone,<br>
Left and abandon&#8217;d of his velvet friends,<br>
&#8216;&#8217;Tis right:&#8217; quoth he; &#8216;thus misery doth
part<br>
The flux of company:&#8217; anon a careless herd,<br>
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him<br>
And never stays to greet him; &#8216;Ay&#8217; quoth Jaques,<br>
&#8216;Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;<br>
&#8217;Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look<br>
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?&#8217;<br>
Thus most invectively he pierceth through<br>
The body of the country, city, court,<br>
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we<br>
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what&#8217;s worse,<br>
To fright the animals and to kill them up<br>
In their assign&#8217;d and native dwelling-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">And did you leave him in this contemplation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">We did, my lord, weeping and commenting<br>
Upon the sobbing deer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Show me the place:<br>
I love to cope him in these sullen fits,<br>
For then he&#8217;s full of matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll bring you to him straight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

"SCENE II. A room in the palace.">
<h4>SCENE II. A room in the palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Frederick, with
Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Can it be possible that no man saw them?<br>
It cannot be: some villains of my court<br>
Are of consent and sufferance in this.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot hear of any that did see her.<br>
The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,<br>
Saw her abed, and in the morning early<br>
They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft<br>
Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.<br>
Hisperia, the princess&#8217; gentlewoman,<br>
Confesses that she secretly o&#8217;erheard<br>
Your daughter and her cousin much commend<br>
The parts and graces of the wrestler<br>
That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;<br>
And she believes, wherever they are gone,<br>
That youth is surely in their company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Frederick</p>
<p class="speech">Send to his brother; fetch that gallant
hither;<br>
If he be absent, bring his brother to me;<br>
I&#8217;ll make him find him: do this suddenly,<br>
And let not search and inquisition quail<br>
To bring again these foolish runaways.</p>

"SCENE III. Before Oliver&#8217;s house.">
<h4>SCENE III. Before Oliver&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando and Adam,
meeting</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">What, my young master? O, my gentle master!<br>
O my sweet master! O you memory<br>
Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?<br>
Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?<br>
And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?<br>
Why would you be so fond to overcome<br>
The bonny priser of the humorous duke?<br>
Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.<br>
Know you not, master, to some kind of men<br>
Their graces serve them but as enemies?<br>
No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,<br>
Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.<br>
O, what a world is this, when what is comely<br>
Envenoms him that bears it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">O unhappy youth!<br>
Come not within these doors; within this roof<br>
The enemy of all your graces lives:<br>
Your brother&#8212;no, no brother; yet the son&#8212;<br>
Yet not the son, I will not call him son<br>
Of him I was about to call his father&#8212;<br>
Hath heard your praises, and this night he means<br>
To burn the lodging where you use to lie<br>
And you within it: if he fail of that,<br>
He will have other means to cut you off.<br>
I overheard him and his practises.<br>
This is no place; this house is but a butchery:<br>
Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">No matter whither, so you come not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my
food?<br>
Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce<br>
A thievish living on the common road?<br>
This I must do, or know not what to do:<br>
Yet this I will not do, do how I can;<br>
I rather will subject me to the malice<br>
Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,<br>
The thrifty hire I saved under your father,<br>
Which I did store to be my foster-nurse<br>
When service should in my old limbs lie lame<br>
And unregarded age in corners thrown:<br>
Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,<br>
Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,<br>
Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;<br>
And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:<br>
Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;<br>
For in my youth I never did apply<br>
Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,<br>
Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo<br>
The means of weakness and debility;<br>
Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,<br>
Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;<br>
I&#8217;ll do the service of a younger man<br>
In all your business and necessities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">O good old man, how well in thee appears<br>
The constant service of the antique world,<br>
When service sweat for duty, not for meed!<br>
Thou art not for the fashion of these times,<br>
Where none will sweat but for promotion,<br>
And having that, do choke their service up<br>
Even with the having: it is not so with thee.<br>
But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,<br>
That cannot so much as a blossom yield<br>
In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry<br>
But come thy ways; well go along together,<br>
And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,<br>
We&#8217;ll light upon some settled low content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">Master, go on, and I will follow thee,<br>
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.<br>
From seventeen years till now almost fourscore<br>
Here lived I, but now live here no more.<br>
At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;<br>
But at fourscore it is too late a week:<br>
Yet fortune cannot recompense me better<br>
Than to die well and not my master&#8217;s debtor.</p>

Celia for Aliena, and Touchstone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not
weary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I could find in my heart to disgrace my
man&#8217;s
apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
good Aliena!</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no
further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">For my part, I had rather bear with you than
bear
you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
for I think you have no money in your purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Well, this is the forest of Arden.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I
was
at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
must be content.</p>

Silvius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old
in
solemn talk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">That is the way to make her scorn you still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">O Corin, that thou knew&#8217;st how I do love
her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,<br>
Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover<br>
As ever sigh&#8217;d upon a midnight pillow:<br>
But if thy love were ever like to mine&#8212;<br>
As sure I think did never man love so&#8212;<br>
How many actions most ridiculous<br>
Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Into a thousand that I have forgotten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvius</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou didst then ne&#8217;er love so
heartily!<br>
If thou remember&#8217;st not the slightest folly<br>
That ever love did make thee run into,<br>
Thou hast not loved:<br>
Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,<br>
Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress&#8217; praise,<br>
Thou hast not loved:<br>
Or if thou hast not broke from company<br>
Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,<br>
Thou hast not loved.<br>
O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,<br>
I have by hard adventure found mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I
broke
my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
kissing of her batlet and the cow&#8217;s dugs that her
pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
two cods and, giving her them again, said with
weeping tears &#8216;Wear these for my sake.&#8217; We that are
true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I shall ne&#8217;er be ware of mine own wit
till I
break my shins against it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Jove, Jove! this shepherd&#8217;s passion<br>
Is much upon my fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">And mine; but it grows something stale with
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, one of you question yond man<br>
If he for gold will give us any food:<br>
I faint almost to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Holla, you clown!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, fool: he&#8217;s not thy kinsman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Who calls?</p>
<p class="speaker">Touchstone</p>
<p class="speech">Your betters, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Else are they very wretched.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold<br>
Can in this desert place buy entertainment,<br>
Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:<br>
Here&#8217;s a young maid with travel much oppress&#8217;d<br>
And faints for succor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Fair sir, I pity her<br>
And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,<br>
My fortunes were more able to relieve her;<br>
But I am shepherd to another man<br>
And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:<br>
My master is of churlish disposition<br>
And little recks to find the way to heaven<br>
By doing deeds of hospitality:<br>
Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed<br>
Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,<br>
By reason of his absence, there is nothing<br>
That you will feed on; but what is, come see.<br>
And in my voice most welcome shall you be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">What is he that shall buy his flock and
pasture?</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">That young swain that you saw here but
erewhile,<br>
That little cares for buying any thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosalind</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,<br>
Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,<br>
And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Celia</p>
<p class="speech">And we will mend thy wages. I like this
place.<br>
And willingly could waste my time in it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Corin</p>
<p class="speech">Assuredly the thing is to be sold:<br>
Go with me: if you like upon report<br>
The soil, the profit and this kind of life,<br>
I will your very faithful feeder be<br>
And buy it with your gold right suddenly.</p>

the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
not, hold your tongues.</p>

For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
the arm&#8217;s end: I will here be with thee presently;
and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
thou lookest cheerly, and I&#8217;ll be with thee quickly.
Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for

<p class="speech">Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,<br>
That your poor friends must woo your company?<br>
What, you look merrily!</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">A fool, a fool! I met a fool i&#8217; the
forest,<br>
A motley fool; a miserable world!<br>
As I do live by food, I met a fool<br>
Who laid him down and bask&#8217;d him in the sun,<br>
And rail&#8217;d on Lady Fortune in good terms,<br>
In good set terms and yet a motley fool.<br>
&#8216;Good morrow, fool,&#8217; quoth I. &#8216;No, sir,&#8217;
quoth he,<br>
&#8216;Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me
fortune:&#8217;<br>
And then he drew a dial from his poke,<br>
And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,<br>
Says very wisely, &#8216;It is ten o&#8217;clock:<br>
Thus we may see,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;how the world wags:<br>
&#8217;Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,<br>
And after one hour more &#8217;twill be eleven;<br>
And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,<br>
And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;<br>
And thereby hangs a tale.&#8217; When I did hear<br>
The motley fool thus moral on the time,<br>
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,<br>
That fools should be so deep-contemplative,<br>
And I did laugh sans intermission<br>
An hour by his dial. O noble fool!<br>
A worthy fool! Motley&#8217;s the only wear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">What fool is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,<br>
And says, if ladies be but young and fair,<br>
They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,<br>
Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit<br>
After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm&#8217;d<br>
With observation, the which he vents<br>
In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!<br>
I am ambitious for a motley coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt have one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">It is my only suit;<br>
Provided that you weed your better judgments<br>
Of all opinion that grows rank in them<br>
That I am wise. I must have liberty<br>
Withal, as large a charter as the wind,<br>
To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;<br>
And they that are most galled with my folly,<br>
They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?<br>
The &#8216;why&#8217; is plain as way to parish church:<br>
He that a fool doth very wisely hit<br>
Doth very foolishly, although he smart,<br>
Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,<br>
The wise man&#8217;s folly is anatomized<br>
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.<br>
Invest me in my motley; give me leave<br>
To speak my mind, and I will through and through<br>
Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,<br>
If they will patiently receive my medicine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">What, for a counter, would I do but good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:<br>
For thou thyself hast been a libertine,<br>
As sensual as the brutish sting itself;<br>
And all the embossed sores and headed evils,<br>
That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,<br>
Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Why, who cries out on pride,<br>
That can therein tax any private party?<br>
Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,<br>
Till that the weary very means do ebb?<br>
What woman in the city do I name,<br>
When that I say the city-woman bears<br>
The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?<br>
Who can come in and say that I mean her,<br>
When such a one as she such is her neighbour?<br>
Or what is he of basest function<br>
That says his bravery is not of my cost,<br>
Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits<br>
His folly to the mettle of my speech?<br>
There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein<br>
My tongue hath wrong&#8217;d him: if it do him right,<br>
Then he hath wrong&#8217;d himself; if he be free,<br>
Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,<br>
Unclaim&#8217;d of any man. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Orlando, with his sword
drawn</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear, and eat no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I have eat none yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">Of what kind should this cock come of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou thus bolden&#8217;d, man, by thy
distress,<br>
Or else a rude despiser of good manners,<br>
That in civility thou seem&#8217;st so empty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">You touch&#8217;d my vein at first: the thorny
point<br>
Of bare distress hath ta&#8217;en from me the show<br>
Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred<br>
And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:<br>
He dies that touches any of this fruit<br>
Till I and my affairs are answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">An you will not be answered with reason, I must
die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">What would you have? Your gentleness shall
force<br>
More than your force move us to gentleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I almost die for food; and let me have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:<br>
I thought that all things had been savage here;<br>
And therefore put I on the countenance<br>
Of stern commandment. But whate&#8217;er you are<br>
That in this desert inaccessible,<br>
Under the shade of melancholy boughs,<br>
Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time<br>
If ever you have look&#8217;d on better days,<br>
If ever been where bells have knoll&#8217;d to church,<br>
If ever sat at any good man&#8217;s feast,<br>
If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear<br>
And know what &#8217;tis to pity and be pitied,<br>
Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:<br>
In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">True is it that we have seen better days,<br>
And have with holy bell been knoll&#8217;d to church<br>
And sat at good men&#8217;s feasts and wiped our eyes<br>
Of drops that sacred pity hath engender&#8217;d:<br>
And therefore sit you down in gentleness<br>
And take upon command what help we have<br>
That to your wanting may be minister&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">Then but forbear your food a little while,<br>
Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn<br>
And give it food. There is an old poor man,<br>
Who after me hath many a weary step<br>
Limp&#8217;d in pure love: till he be first sufficed,<br>
Oppress&#8217;d with two weak evils, age and hunger,<br>
I will not touch a bit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Go find him out,<br>
And we will nothing waste till you return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I thank ye; and be blest for your good
comfort!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:<br>
This wide and universal theatre<br>
Presents more woeful pageants than the scene<br>
Wherein we play in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaques</p>
<p class="speech">All the world&#8217;s a stage,<br>
And all the men and women merely players:<br>
They have their exits and their entrances;<br>
And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,<br>
Mewling and puking in the nurse&#8217;s arms.<br>
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel<br>
And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
Made to his mistress&#8217; eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
Even in the cannon&#8217;s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
Into the lean and slipper&#8217;d pantaloon,<br>
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,<br>
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,<br>
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Orlando, with
Adam</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,<br>
And let him feed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orlando</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you most for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adam</p>
<p class="speech">So had you need:<br>
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you<br>
As yet, to question you about your fortunes.<br>
Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Amiens</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[sings]</span>
Blow, blow, thou winter wind.<br>
Thou art not so unkind<br>
As man&#8217;s ingratitude;<br>
Thy tooth is not so keen,<br>
Because thou art not seen,<br>
Although thy breath be rude.<br>
Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:<br>
Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:<br>
Then, heigh-ho, the holly!<br>
This life is most jolly.<br>
Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,<br>
That dost not bite so nigh<br>
As benefits forgot:<br>
Though thou the waters warp,<br>
Thy sting is not so sharp<br>
As friend remember&#8217;d not.<br>
Heigh-ho! sing, &amp; c.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Senior</p>
<p class="speech">If that you were the good Sir Rowland&#8217;s
son,<br>
As you have whisper&#8217;d faithfully you were,<br>
And as mine eye doth his effigies witness<br>
Most truly limn&#8217;d and living in your face,<br>
Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke<br>
That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,<br>
Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,<br>
Thou art right welcome as thy master is.<br>
Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,<br>
And let me all your fortunes understand.</p>
