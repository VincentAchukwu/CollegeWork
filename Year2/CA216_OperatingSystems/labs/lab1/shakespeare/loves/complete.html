<h4>Scene I. The king of Navarre&#8217;s park.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ferdinand king of
Navarre, Biron, Longaville and Dumain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,<br>
Live register&#8217;d upon our brazen tombs<br>
And then grace us in the disgrace of death;<br>
When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,<br>
The endeavor of this present breath may buy<br>
That honour which shall bate his scythe&#8217;s keen edge<br>
And make us heirs of all eternity.<br>
Therefore, brave conquerors,&#8212;for so you are,<br>
That war against your own affections<br>
And the huge army of the world&#8217;s desires,&#8212;<br>
Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:<br>
Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;<br>
Our court shall be a little Academe,<br>
Still and contemplative in living art.<br>
You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,<br>
Have sworn for three years&#8217; term to live with me<br>
My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes<br>
That are recorded in this schedule here:<br>
Your oaths are pass&#8217;d; and now subscribe your names,<br>
That his own hand may strike his honour down<br>
That violates the smallest branch herein:<br>
If you are arm&#8217;d to do as sworn to do,<br>
Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">I am resolved; &#8217;tis but a three
years&#8217; fast:<br>
The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:<br>
Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits<br>
Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:<br>
The grosser manner of these world&#8217;s delights<br>
He throws upon the gross world&#8217;s baser slaves:<br>
To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;<br>
With all these living in philosophy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I can but say their protestation over;<br>
So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,<br>
That is, to live and study here three years.<br>
But there are other strict observances;<br>
As, not to see a woman in that term,<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there;<br>
And one day in a week to touch no food<br>
And but one meal on every day beside,<br>
The which I hope is not enrolled there;<br>
And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,<br>
And not be seen to wink of all the day&#8212;<br>
When I was wont to think no harm all night<br>
And make a dark night too of half the day&#8212;<br>
Which I hope well is not enrolled there:<br>
O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,<br>
Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Your oath is pass&#8217;d to pass away from
these.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:<br>
I only swore to study with your grace<br>
And stay here in your court for three years&#8217; space.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.<br>
What is the end of study? let me know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that to know, which else we should not
know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Things hid and barr&#8217;d, you mean, from
common sense?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that is study&#8217;s godlike recompense.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, then; I will swear to study so,<br>
To know the thing I am forbid to know:<br>
As thus,&#8212;to study where I well may dine,<br>
When I to feast expressly am forbid;<br>
Or study where to meet some mistress fine,<br>
When mistresses from common sense are hid;<br>
Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,<br>
Study to break it and not break my troth.<br>
If study&#8217;s gain be thus and this be so,<br>
Study knows that which yet it doth not know:<br>
Swear me to this, and I will ne&#8217;er say no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">These be the stops that hinder study quite<br>
And train our intellects to vain delight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Why, all delights are vain; but that most
vain,<br>
Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:<br>
As, painfully to pore upon a book<br>
To seek the light of truth; while truth the while<br>
Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:<br>
Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:<br>
So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,<br>
Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.<br>
Study me how to please the eye indeed<br>
By fixing it upon a fairer eye,<br>
Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed<br>
And give him light that it was blinded by.<br>
Study is like the heaven&#8217;s glorious sun<br>
That will not be deep-search&#8217;d with saucy looks:<br>
Small have continual plodders ever won<br>
Save base authority from others&#8217; books<br>
These earthly godfathers of heaven&#8217;s lights<br>
That give a name to every fixed star<br>
Have no more profit of their shining nights<br>
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.<br>
Too much to know is to know nought but fame;<br>
And every godfather can give a name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">How well he&#8217;s read, to reason against
reading!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">He weeds the corn and still lets grow the
weeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">The spring is near when green geese are
a-breeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">How follows that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fit in his place and time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">In reason nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Something then in rhyme.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,<br>
That bites the first-born infants of the spring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast<br>
Before the birds have any cause to sing?<br>
Why should I joy in any abortive birth?<br>
At Christmas I no more desire a rose<br>
Than wish a snow in May&#8217;s new-fangled mirth;<br>
But like of each thing that in season grows.<br>
So you, to study now it is too late,<br>
Climb o&#8217;er the house to unlock the little gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with
you:<br>
And though I have for barbarism spoke more<br>
Than for that angel knowledge you can say,<br>
Yet confident I&#8217;ll keep what I have swore<br>
And bide the penance of each three years&#8217; day.<br>
Give me the paper; let me read the same;<br>
And to the strict&#8217;st decrees I&#8217;ll write my name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">How well this yielding rescues thee from
shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;Item,
That no woman shall come within a
mile of my court:&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">Hath this been proclaimed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Four days ago.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s see the penalty.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;On pain of losing her tongue.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">Who devised this penalty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that did I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lord, and why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">To fright them hence with that dread penalty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">A dangerous law against gentility!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Item, If any man be seen to talk with a
woman
within the term of three years, he shall endure such
public shame as the rest of the court can possibly
devise.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">This article, my liege, yourself must break;<br>
For well you know here comes in embassy<br>
The French king&#8217;s daughter with yourself to speak&#8212;<br>
A maid of grace and complete majesty&#8212;<br>
About surrender up of Aquitaine<br>
To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:<br>
Therefore this article is made in vain,<br>
Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, lords? Why, this was quite
forgot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">So study evermore is overshot:<br>
While it doth study to have what it would<br>
It doth forget to do the thing it should,<br>
And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,<br>
&#8217;Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">We must of force dispense with this decree;<br>
She must lie here on mere necessity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Necessity will make us all forsworn<br>
Three thousand times within this three years&#8217; space;<br>
For every man with his affects is born,<br>
Not by might master&#8217;d but by special grace:<br>
If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;<br>
I am forsworn on &#8216;mere necessity.&#8217;<br>
So to the laws at large I write my name:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Subscribes</span></p>
<p class="speech">And he that breaks them in the least degree<br>
Stands in attainder of eternal shame:<br>
Suggestions are to other as to me;<br>
But I believe, although I seem so loath,<br>
I am the last that will last keep his oath.<br>
But is there no quick recreation granted?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is
haunted<br>
With a refined traveller of Spain;<br>
A man in all the world&#8217;s new fashion planted,<br>
That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;<br>
One whom the music of his own vain tongue<br>
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;<br>
A man of complements, whom right and wrong<br>
Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:<br>
This child of fancy, that Armado hight,<br>
For interim to our studies shall relate<br>
In high-born words the worth of many a knight<br>
From tawny Spain lost in the world&#8217;s debate.<br>
How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;<br>
But, I protest, I love to hear him lie<br>
And I will use him for my minstrelsy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Armado is a most illustrious wight,<br>
A man of fire-new words, fashion&#8217;s own knight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;<br>
And so to study, three years is but short.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dull with a letter, and
Costard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Which is the duke&#8217;s own person?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This, fellow: what wouldst?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">I myself reprehend his own person, for I am
his
grace&#8217;s tharborough: but I would see his own person
in flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This is he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Arme&#8212;Arme&#8212;commends you.
There&#8217;s villany
abroad: this letter will tell you more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">A letter from the magnificent Armado.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high
words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us
patience!</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">To hear? or forbear laughing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or
to
forbear both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause
to
climb in the merriness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">The matter is to me, sir, as concerning
Jaquenetta.<br>
The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">In what manner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">In manner and form following, sir; all those
three:
I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
her upon the form, and taken following her into the
park; which, put together, is in manner and form
following. Now, sir, for the manner,&#8212;it is the
manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,&#8212;
in some form.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">For the following, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">As it shall follow in my correction: and God
defend
the right!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hear this letter with attention?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">As we would hear an oracle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after
the flesh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;Great
deputy, the welkin&#8217;s vicegerent and
sole dominator of Navarre, my soul&#8217;s earth&#8217;s god,
and body&#8217;s fostering patron.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Not a word of Costard yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;so it
is,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is,
in
telling true, but so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Be to me and every man that dares not fight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">No words!</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Of other men&#8217;s secrets, I beseech you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;so it
is, besieged with sable-coloured
melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8217;that
unlettered small-knowing soul,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8217;that
shallow vassal,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Still me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;which,
as I remember, hight Costard,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O, me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;sorted
and consorted, contrary to thy
established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
which with,&#8212;O, with&#8212;but with this I passion to say
wherewith,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">With a wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;with a
child of our grandmother Eve, a
female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
punishment, by thy sweet grace&#8217;s officer, Anthony
Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
estimation.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Me, an&#8217;t shall please you; I am
Anthony Dull.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;For
Jaquenetta,&#8212;so is the weaker vessel
called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
swain,&#8212;I keep her as a vessel of the law&#8217;s fury;
and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
and heart-burning heat of duty.
Don Adriano de Armado.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This is not so well as I looked for, but the
best
that ever I heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what
say
you to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I confess the wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Did you hear the proclamation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">I do confess much of the hearing it but little
of
the marking of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">It was proclaimed a year&#8217;s imprisonment, to
be taken
with a wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a
damsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Well, it was proclaimed &#8216;damsel.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a
virgin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed
&#8217;virgin.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken
with a maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">This maid will not serve your turn, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">This maid will serve my turn, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall
fast
a week with bran and water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather pray a month with mutton and
porridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">And Don Armado shall be your keeper.<br>
My Lord Biron, see him deliver&#8217;d o&#8217;er:<br>
And go we, lords, to put in practise that<br>
Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Ferdinand, Longaville,
and Dumain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll lay my head to any good man&#8217;s
hat,<br>
These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.<br>
Sirrah, come on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I
was
taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
till then, sit thee down, sorrow!</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don Adriano de Armado
and Moth</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Boy, what sign is it when a man of great
spirit
grows melancholy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear
imp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; O Lord, sir, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou part sadness and melancholy,
my
tender juvenal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">By a familiar demonstration of the working, my
tough senior.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Why tough senior? why tough senior?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent
epitheton
appertaining to thy young days, which we may
nominate tender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to
your
old time, which we may name tough.
</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Pretty and apt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt?
or<br>
I apt, and my saying pretty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Thou pretty, because little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore apt, because quick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Speak you this in my praise, master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">In thy condign praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">I will praise an eel with the same praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">What, that an eel is ingenious?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">That an eel is quick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest
my blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">I am answered, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I love not to be crossed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He speaks the
mere contrary; crosses love not him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I have promised to study three years with the
duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">You may do it in an hour, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Impossible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">How many is one thrice told?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a
tapster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I confess both: they are both the varnish of
a
complete man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum
of
deuce-ace amounts to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">It doth amount to one more than two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Which the base vulgar do call three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">True.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now
here
is three studied, ere ye&#8217;ll thrice wink: and how
easy it is to put &#8216;years&#8217; to the word
&#8217;three,&#8217; and
study three years in two words, the dancing horse
will tell you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">A most fine figure!</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">To prove you a cipher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it
is
base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
have been in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Hercules, master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy,
name
more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
repute and carriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage,
great
carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
like a porter: and he was in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I
do
excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson&#8217;s
love, my dear Moth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">A woman, master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Of what complexion?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one
of the four.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me precisely of what complexion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Of the sea-water green, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Is that one of the four complexions?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">As I have read, sir; and the best of them
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have
a
love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
for it. He surely affected her for her wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">My love is most immaculate white and red.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked
under
such colours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Define, define, well-educated infant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">My father&#8217;s wit and my mother&#8217;s
tongue, assist me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
pathetical!</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech verse">If she be made of white and
red,<br>
&#8195;Her faults will ne&#8217;er be known,<br>
For blushing cheeks by faults are bred<br>
&#8195;And fears by pale white shown:<br>
Then if she fear, or be to blame,<br>
&#8195;By this you shall not know,<br>
For still her cheeks possess the same<br>
&#8195;Which native she doth owe.</p>
<p class="speech">A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
white and red.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the
Beggar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">The world was very guilty of such a ballad
some
three ages since: but I think now &#8217;tis not to be
found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
the writing nor the tune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will have that subject newly writ o&#8217;er,
that I may
example my digression by some mighty precedent.
Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> To be whipped;
and yet a better love than
my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">And that&#8217;s great marvel, loving a light
wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I say, sing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear till this company be past.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dull, Costard, and
Jaquenetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, the duke&#8217;s pleasure is, that you keep
Costard
safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
nor no penance; but a&#8217; must fast three days a week.
For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">Man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will visit thee at the lodge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s hereby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I know where it is situate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">Lord, how wise you are!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell thee wonders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">With that face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">So I heard you say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">And so, farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jaquenetta</p>
<p class="speech">Fair weather after you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Jaquenetta, away!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Dull and
Jaquenetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere
thou
be pardoned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on
a
full stomach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt be heavily punished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">I am more bound to you than your fellows, for
they
are but lightly rewarded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Take away this villain; shut him up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you transgressing slave; away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being
loose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to
prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if ever I do see the merry days of
desolation
that I have seen, some shall see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">What shall some see?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look
upon.
It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
God I have as little patience as another man; and
therefore I can be quiet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Moth and
Costard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I do affect the very ground, which is base,
where
her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
how can that be true love which is falsely
attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
Cupid&#8217;s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules&#8217; club;
and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard&#8217;s rapier.
The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.</p>

<p class="speech">Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:<br>
Consider who the king your father sends,<br>
To whom he sends, and what&#8217;s his embassy:<br>
Yourself, held precious in the world&#8217;s esteem,<br>
To parley with the sole inheritor<br>
Of all perfections that a man may owe,<br>
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight<br>
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.<br>
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace<br>
As Nature was in making graces dear<br>
When she did starve the general world beside<br>
And prodigally gave them all to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,<br>
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:<br>
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,<br>
Not utter&#8217;d by base sale of chapmen&#8217;s tongues:<br>
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth<br>
Than you much willing to be counted wise<br>
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.<br>
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,<br>
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame<br>
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,<br>
Till painful study shall outwear three years,<br>
No woman may approach his silent court:<br>
Therefore to&#8217;s seemeth it a needful course,<br>
Before we enter his forbidden gates,<br>
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,<br>
Bold of your worthiness, we single you<br>
As our best-moving fair solicitor.<br>
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,<br>
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,<br>

Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir<br>
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized<br>
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:<br>
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem&#8217;d;<br>
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:<br>
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.<br>
The only soil of his fair virtue&#8217;s gloss,<br>
If virtue&#8217;s gloss will stain with any soil,<br>
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;<br>
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills<br>
It should none spare that come within his power.</p>

<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,<br>
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:<br>
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;<br>
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,<br>
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.<br>
I saw him at the Duke Alencon&#8217;s once;<br>
And much too little of that good I saw<br>
Is my report to his great worthiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Another of these students at that time<br>
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.<br>
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,<br>
Within the limit of becoming mirth,<br>
I never spent an hour&#8217;s talk withal:<br>
His eye begets occasion for his wit;<br>
For every object that the one doth catch<br>
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,<br>
Which his fair tongue, conceit&#8217;s expositor,<br>
Delivers in such apt and gracious words<br>
That aged ears play truant at his tales<br>

And he and his competitors in oath<br>
Were all address&#8217;d to meet you, gentle lady,<br>

And sin to break it.<br>
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:<br>
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.<br>
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,<br>
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.</p>

<p class="speech">Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</p>

<p class="speech">Madam, your father here doth intimate<br>
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;<br>
Being but the one half of an entire sum<br>
Disbursed by my father in his wars.<br>
But say that he or we, as neither have,<br>
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid<br>
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,<br>
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,<br>
Although not valued to the money&#8217;s worth.<br>
If then the king your father will restore<br>
But that one half which is unsatisfied,<br>
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,<br>
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.<br>
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,<br>
For here he doth demand to have repaid<br>
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,<br>
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,<br>
To have his title live in Aquitaine;<br>
Which we much rather had depart withal<br>
And have the money by our father lent<br>
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.<br>
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far<br>
From reason&#8217;s yielding, your fair self should make<br>
A yielding &#8217;gainst some reason in my breast<br>
And go well satisfied to France again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">You do the king my father too much wrong<br>
And wrong the reputation of your name,<br>
In so unseeming to confess receipt<br>
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I do protest I never heard of it;<br>
And if you prove it, I&#8217;ll repay it back<br>
Or yield up Aquitaine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We arrest your word.<br>
Boyet, you can produce acquittances<br>
For such a sum from special officers<br>
Of Charles his father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Satisfy me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">So please your grace, the packet is not come<br>
Where that and other specialties are bound:<br>
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">It shall suffice me: at which interview<br>
All liberal reason I will yield unto.<br>
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand<br>
As honour without breach of honour may<br>
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:<br>
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;<br>
But here without you shall be so received<br>
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,<br>
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.<br>
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:<br>
To-morrow shall we visit you again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>

<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance light in the light. I desire her

<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">It was well done of you to take him at his

<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
agree:<br>
This civil war of wits were much better used<br>
On Navarre and his book-men; for here &#8217;tis abused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">If my observation, which very seldom lies,<br>
By the heart&#8217;s still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,<br>

<p class="speech">With that which we lovers entitle affected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, all his behaviors did make their retire<br>
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:<br>
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress&#8217;d,<br>
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express&#8217;d:<br>
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,<br>
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;<br>
All senses to that sense did make their repair,<br>
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:<br>
Methought all his senses were lock&#8217;d in his eye,<br>
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;<br>
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were
glass&#8217;d,<br>
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass&#8217;d:<br>
His face&#8217;s own margent did quote such amazes<br>
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.<br>
I&#8217;ll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,<br>
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.<br>
I only have made a mouth of his eye,<br>
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art an old love-monger and speakest
skilfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">He is Cupid&#8217;s grandfather and learns news
of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is
but grim.</p>

<p class="speech">Don</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Warble, child; make passionate my sense of
hearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Concolinel.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Singing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this
key,
give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Master, will you win your love with a French
brawl?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">How meanest thou? brawling in French?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune
at
the tongue&#8217;s end, canary to it with your feet, humour
it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
love; with your hat penthouse-like o&#8217;er the shop of
your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
These are complements, these are humours; these
betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
these; and make them men of note&#8212;do you note
me?&#8212;that most are affected to these.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">How hast thou purchased this experience?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">By my penny of observation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">But O,&#8212;but O,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;The hobby-horse is forgot.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Callest thou my love
&#8217;hobby-horse&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and
your
love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Almost I had.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Negligent student! learn her by heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">By heart and in heart, boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">And out of heart, master: all those three I will
prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">What wilt thou prove?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without,
upon
the instant: by heart you love her, because your
heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
because your heart is in love with her; and out of
heart you love her, being out of heart that you
cannot enjoy her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I am all these three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">And three times as much more, and yet nothing
at
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a
letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">A message well sympathized; a horse to be
ambassador
for an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! what sayest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the
horse,
for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">The way is but short: away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">As swift as lead, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">The meaning, pretty ingenious?<br>
Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I say lead is slow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">You are too swift, sir, to say so:<br>
Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet smoke of rhetoric!<br>
He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that&#8217;s he:<br>
I shoot thee at the swain.</p>

mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
l&#8217;envoy, no l&#8217;envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l&#8217;envoy, and
the word l&#8217;envoy for a salve?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Do the wise think them other? is not
l&#8217;envoy a salve?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make
plain<br>
Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.<br>
I will example it:</p>
<p class="speech verse">
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,<br>
Were still at odds, being but three.</p>
<p class="speech">
There&#8217;s the moral. Now the l&#8217;envoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">I will add the l&#8217;envoy. Say the moral
again.</p>

<p class="speech verse">The fox, the ape, and the
humble-bee,<br>
Were still at odds, being but three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech verse">Until the goose came out of
door,<br>
And stay&#8217;d the odds by adding four.</p>
<p class="speech">
Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
my l&#8217;envoy.</p>
<p class="speech verse">
The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,<br>

<p class="speech">The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose,
that&#8217;s flat.<br>
Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.<br>
To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:<br>
Let me see; a fat l&#8217;envoy; ay, that&#8217;s a fat goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, come hither. How did this argument
begin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">By saying that a costard was broken in a
shin.<br>
Then call&#8217;d you for the l&#8217;envoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
argument in;<br>
Then the boy&#8217;s fat l&#8217;envoy, the goose that you
bought;<br>
And he ended the market.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a
shin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you sensibly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak
that l&#8217;envoy:<br>
I Costard, running out, that was safely within,<br>
Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">We will talk no more of this matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Till there be more matter in the shin.</p>

Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush<br>
That we must stand and play the murderer in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Forester</p>
<p class="speech">Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;<br>
A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,<br>
And thereupon thou speak&#8217;st the fairest shoot.</p>

<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, never paint me now:<br>
Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.<br>
Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:<br>
Fair payment for foul words is more than due.</p>

<p class="speech">See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!<br>
O heresy in fair, fit for these days!<br>
A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.<br>
But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,<br>
And shooting well is then accounted ill.<br>
Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:<br>
Not wounding, pity would not let me do&#8217;t;<br>
If wounding, then it was to show my skill,<br>
That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.<br>
And out of question so it is sometimes,<br>
Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,<br>
When, for fame&#8217;s sake, for praise, an outward part,<br>
We bend to that the working of the heart;<br>

&#8216;By heaven, that thou art fair, is most
infallible;
true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
vulgar,&#8212;O base and obscure vulgar!&#8212;videlicet, He
came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king&#8217;s.
The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
beggar&#8217;s. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
side? the king&#8217;s: no, on both in one, or one in
both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,

<p class="speech">The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood;
ripe
as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
the soil, the land, the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are
sweetly
varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas not a haud credo; &#8217;twas a

<p class="speech">Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
insert again my haud credo for a deer.</p>

O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are
bred
in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
the duller parts:</p>
<p class="speech">
And such barren plants are set before us, that we
thankful should be,<br>
Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
do fructify in us more than he.<br>
For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a
fool,<br>
So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:<br>
But omne bene, say I; being of an old father&#8217;s mind,<br>

And raught not to five weeks when he came to
five-score.<br>

for
the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
that, &#8217;twas a pricket that the princess killed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal
epitaph
on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.</p>

facility.<br>
The preyful princess pierced and prick&#8217;d a pretty
pleasing pricket;<br>
Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
sore with shooting.<br>
The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
from thicket;<br>
Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.<br>
If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
one sorel.<br>
Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.</p>

foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and

gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
thankful for it.</p>

Thy eye Jove&#8217;s lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful

Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.<br>

in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o&#8217; my
sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one

So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not<br>
To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,<br>
As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote<br>
The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:<br>
Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright<br>
Through the transparent bosom of the deep,<br>
As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;<br>
Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:<br>
No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;<br>
So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.<br>
Do but behold the tears that swell in me,<br>
And they thy glory through my grief will show:<br>
But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep<br>
My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.<br>
O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,<br>
No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.<br>
How shall she know my griefs? I&#8217;ll drop the paper:<br>

<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Some salve for perjury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis more than need.<br>
Have at you, then, affection&#8217;s men at arms.<br>
Consider what you first did swear unto,<br>
To fast, to study, and to see no woman;<br>
Flat treason &#8217;gainst the kingly state of youth.<br>
Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;<br>
And abstinence engenders maladies.<br>
And where that you have vow&#8217;d to study, lords,<br>
In that each of you have forsworn his book,<br>
Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?<br>
For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,<br>
Have found the ground of study&#8217;s excellence<br>
Without the beauty of a woman&#8217;s face?<br>
From women&#8217;s eyes this doctrine I derive;<br>
They are the ground, the books, the academes<br>
From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire<br>
Why, universal plodding poisons up<br>
The nimble spirits in the arteries,<br>
As motion and long-during action tires<br>
The sinewy vigour of the traveller.<br>
Now, for not looking on a woman&#8217;s face,<br>
You have in that forsworn the use of eyes<br>
And study too, the causer of your vow;<br>
For where is any author in the world<br>
Teaches such beauty as a woman&#8217;s eye?<br>
Learning is but an adjunct to ourself<br>
And where we are our learning likewise is:<br>
Then when ourselves we see in ladies&#8217; eyes,<br>
Do we not likewise see our learning there?<br>
O, we have made a vow to study, lords,<br>
And in that vow we have forsworn our books.<br>
For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,<br>
In leaden contemplation have found out<br>
Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes<br>
Of beauty&#8217;s tutors have enrich&#8217;d you with?<br>
Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;<br>
And therefore, finding barren practisers,<br>
Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:<br>
But love, first learned in a lady&#8217;s eyes,<br>
Lives not alone immured in the brain;<br>
But, with the motion of all elements,<br>
Courses as swift as thought in every power,<br>
And gives to every power a double power,<br>
Above their functions and their offices.<br>
It adds a precious seeing to the eye;<br>
A lover&#8217;s eyes will gaze an eagle blind;<br>
A lover&#8217;s ear will hear the lowest sound,<br>
When the suspicious head of theft is stopp&#8217;d:<br>
Love&#8217;s feeling is more soft and sensible<br>
Than are the tender horns of cockl&#8217;d snails;<br>
Love&#8217;s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:<br>
For valour, is not Love a Hercules,<br>
Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?<br>
Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical<br>
As bright Apollo&#8217;s lute, strung with his hair:<br>
And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods<br>
Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.<br>
Never durst poet touch a pen to write<br>
Until his ink were temper&#8217;d with Love&#8217;s sighs;<br>
O, then his lines would ravish savage ears<br>
And plant in tyrants mild humility.<br>
From women&#8217;s eyes this doctrine I derive:<br>
They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;<br>
They are the books, the arts, the academes,<br>
That show, contain and nourish all the world:<br>
Else none at all in ought proves excellent.<br>
Then fools you were these women to forswear,<br>
Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.<br>
For wisdom&#8217;s sake, a word that all men love,<br>
Or for love&#8217;s sake, a word that loves all men,<br>
Or for men&#8217;s sake, the authors of these women,<br>
Or women&#8217;s sake, by whom we men are men,<br>
Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,<br>
Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.<br>
It is religion to be thus forsworn,<br>
For charity itself fulfills the law,<br>
And who can sever love from charity?</p>

<p class="speech">And win them too: therefore let us devise<br>
Some entertainment for them in their tents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">First, from the park let us conduct them
thither;<br>
Then homeward every man attach the hand<br>
Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon<br>
We will with some strange pastime solace them,<br>
Such as the shortness of the time can shape;<br>
For revels, dances, masks and merry hours<br>
Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Away, away! no time shall be omitted<br>
That will betime, and may by us be fitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Allons! allons! Sow&#8217;d cockle reap&#8217;d
no corn;<br>
And justice always whirls in equal measure:<br>
Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;<br>
If so, our copper buys no better treasure.</p>

Nathaniel, and Dull</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Satis quod sufficit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at
dinner
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
a companion of the king&#8217;s, who is intituled, nomi-
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty,
his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">A most singular and choice epithet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Draws out his
table-book</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">He draweth out the thread of his verbosity
finer
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,&#8212;d,
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,&#8212;which he
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.</p>

Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers&#8217;

<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">I do, sans question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is the king&#8217;s most sweet pleasure
and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">The posterior of the day, most generous sir,
is
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
assure you, sir, I do assure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my
familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,&#8212;but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,&#8212;that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you shall present before her the Nine
Worthies.
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
our assistants, at the king&#8217;s command, and this most
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Nine Worthies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Where will you find men worthy enough to present
them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant
gentleman,
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
page, Hercules,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough
for
that Worthy&#8217;s thumb: he is not so big as the end of his
club.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules
in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">An excellent device! so, if any of the
audience
hiss, you may cry &#8216;Well done, Hercules! now thou
crushest the snake!&#8217; that is the way to make an
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">For the rest of the Worthies?&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">I will play three myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Thrice-worthy gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell you a thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">We attend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">We will have, if this fadge not, an antique.
I
beseech you, follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all
this while.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Nor understood none neither, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Allons! we will employ thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will
play<br>
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Princess,
Katharine, Rosaline, and Maria</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,<br>
If fairings come thus plentifully in:<br>
A lady wall&#8217;d about with diamonds!<br>
Look you what I have from the loving king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madame, came nothing else along with that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme<br>
As would be cramm&#8217;d up in a sheet of paper,<br>
Writ o&#8217; both sides the leaf, margent and all,<br>
That he was fain to seal on Cupid&#8217;s name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">That was the way to make his godhead wax,<br>
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be friends with him;
a&#8217; kill&#8217;d your sister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;<br>
And so she died: had she been light, like you,<br>
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,<br>
She might ha&#8217; been a grandam ere she died:<br>
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your dark meaning, mouse, of this
light word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A light condition in a beauty dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">We need more light to find your meaning out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll mar the light by taking it in
snuff;<br>
Therefore I&#8217;ll darkly end the argument.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Look what you do, you do it still i&#8217; the
dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">So do not you, for you are a light wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">You weigh me not? O, that&#8217;s you care not
for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Great reason; for &#8216;past cure is still past
care.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Well bandied both; a set of wit well
play&#8217;d.<br>
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:<br>
Who sent it? and what is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">I would you knew:<br>
An if my face were but as fair as yours,<br>
My favour were as great; be witness this.<br>
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:<br>
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,<br>
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:<br>
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.<br>
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Any thing like?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Fair as a text B in a copy-book.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your
debtor,<br>
My red dominical, my golden letter:<br>
O, that your face were not so full of O&#8217;s!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
Dumain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, this glove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Did he not send you twain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam, and moreover<br>
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,<br>
A huge translation of hypocrisy,<br>
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:<br>
The letter is too long by half a mile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart<br>
The chain were longer and the letter short?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.<br>
That same Biron I&#8217;ll torture ere I go:<br>
O that I knew he were but in by the week!<br>
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek<br>
And wait the season and observe the times<br>
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes<br>
And shape his service wholly to my hests<br>
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!<br>
So perttaunt-like would I o&#8217;ersway his state<br>
That he should be my fool and I his fate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">None are so surely caught, when they are
catch&#8217;d,<br>
As wit turn&#8217;d fool: folly, in wisdom hatch&#8217;d,<br>
Hath wisdom&#8217;s warrant and the help of school<br>
And wit&#8217;s own grace to grace a learned fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">The blood of youth burns not with such excess<br>
As gravity&#8217;s revolt to wantonness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Folly in fools bears not so strong a note<br>
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;<br>
Since all the power thereof it doth apply<br>
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am stabb&#8217;d with laughter!
Where&#8217;s her grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Thy news Boyet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Prepare, madam, prepare!<br>
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are<br>
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,<br>
Armed in arguments; you&#8217;ll be surprised:<br>
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;<br>
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they<br>
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Under the cool shade of a sycamore<br>
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;<br>
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,<br>
Toward that shade I might behold addrest<br>
The king and his companions: warily<br>
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<br>
And overheard what you shall overhear,<br>
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.<br>
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,<br>
That well by heart hath conn&#8217;d his embassage:<br>
Action and accent did they teach him there;<br>
&#8216;Thus must thou speak,&#8217; and &#8216;thus thy body
bear:&#8217;<br>
And ever and anon they made a doubt<br>
Presence majestical would put him out,<br>
&#8216;For,&#8217; quoth the king, &#8216;an angel shalt thou
see;<br>
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.&#8217;<br>
The boy replied, &#8216;An angel is not evil;<br>
I should have fear&#8217;d her had she been a devil.&#8217;<br>
With that, all laugh&#8217;d and clapp&#8217;d him on the
shoulder,<br>
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:<br>
One rubb&#8217;d his elbow thus, and fleer&#8217;d and swore<br>
A better speech was never spoke before;<br>
Another, with his finger and his thumb,<br>
Cried, &#8216;Via! we will do&#8217;t, come what will
come;&#8217;<br>
The third he caper&#8217;d, and cried, &#8216;All goes
well;&#8217;<br>
The fourth turn&#8217;d on the toe, and down he fell.<br>
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,<br>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,<br>
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,<br>
To cheque their folly, passion&#8217;s solemn tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">But what, but what, come they to visit us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They do, they do: and are apparell&#8217;d
thus.<br>
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.<br>
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;<br>
And every one his love-feat will advance<br>
Unto his several mistress, which they&#8217;ll know<br>
By favours several which they did bestow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">And will they so? the gallants shall be
task&#8217;d;<br>
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask&#8217;d;<br>
And not a man of them shall have the grace,<br>
Despite of suit, to see a lady&#8217;s face.<br>
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,<br>
And then the king will court thee for his dear;<br>
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,<br>
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.<br>
And change your favours too; so shall your loves<br>
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, then; wear the favours most in
sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">But in this changing what is your intent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:<br>
They do it but in mocking merriment;<br>
And mock for mock is only my intent.<br>
Their several counsels they unbosom shall<br>
To loves mistook, and so be mock&#8217;d withal<br>
Upon the next occasion that we meet,<br>
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">But shall we dance, if they desire
to&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">No, to the death, we will not move a foot;<br>
Nor to their penn&#8217;d speech render we no grace,<br>
But while &#8217;tis spoke each turn away her face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that contempt will kill the speaker&#8217;s
heart,<br>
And quite divorce his memory from his part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt<br>
The rest will ne&#8217;er come in, if he be out<br>
There&#8217;s no such sport as sport by sport o&#8217;erthrown,<br>
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:<br>
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,<br>
And they, well mock&#8217;d, depart away with shame.</p>

<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They will not answer to that epithet;<br>
You were best call it &#8216;daughter-beamed eyes.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">They do not mark me, and that brings me out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Moth</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">What would these strangers? know their minds,
Boyet:<br>
If they do speak our language, &#8217;tis our will:<br>
That some plain man recount their purposes<br>
Know what they would.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">What would you with the princess?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">What would they, say they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">She says, you have it, and you may be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Say to her, we have measured many miles<br>
To tread a measure with her on this grass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They say, that they have measured many a mile<br>
To tread a measure with you on this grass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">It is not so. Ask them how many inches<br>
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,<br>
The measure then of one is easily told.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">If to come hither you have measured miles,<br>
And many miles, the princess bids you tell<br>
How many inches doth fill up one mile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">She hears herself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;How many weary steps,<br>
Of many weary miles you have o&#8217;ergone,<br>
Are number&#8217;d in the travel of one mile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">We number nothing that we spend for you:<br>
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,<br>
That we may do it still without accompt.<br>
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,<br>
That we, like savages, may worship it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">My face is but a moon, and clouded too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!<br>
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,<br>
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;<br>
Thou now request&#8217;st but moonshine in the water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one
change.<br>
Thou bid&#8217;st me beg: this begging is not strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music plays</span></p>
<p class="speech">Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the
moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not dance? How come you thus
estranged?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">You took the moon at full, but now she&#8217;s
changed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.<br>
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Our ears vouchsafe it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">But your legs should do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Since you are strangers and come here by
chance,<br>
We&#8217;ll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Why take we hands, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Only to part friends:<br>
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">More measure of this measure; be not nice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">We can afford no more at such a price.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Your absence only.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That can never be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;<br>
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">If you deny to dance, let&#8217;s hold more
chat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">In private, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I am best pleased with that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They converse

thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,<br>
Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!<br>
There&#8217;s half-a-dozen sweets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Seventh sweet, adieu:<br>
Since you can cog, I&#8217;ll play no more with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">One word in secret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Let it not be sweet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Thou grievest my gall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Gall! bitter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore meet.</p>

<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fair lady,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Say you so? Fair lord,&#8212;<br>
Take that for your fair lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Please it you,<br>
As much in private, and I&#8217;ll bid adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They converse

<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">What, was your vizard made without a tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">I know the reason, lady, why you ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">You have a double tongue within your mask,<br>
And would afford my speechless vizard half.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not
&#8217;veal&#8217; a calf?</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">A calf, fair lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, a fair lord calf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s part the word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll not be your half<br>
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp
mocks!<br>
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">One word in private with you, ere I die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They converse
apart</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen<br>
As is the razor&#8217;s edge invisible,<br>
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,<br>
Above the sense of sense; so sensible<br>
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings<br>
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Not one word more, my maids; break off, break
off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Ferdinand, Lords, and
Blackamoors</span></p>
<p class="speech">Are these the breed of wits so wonder&#8217;d
at?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths
puff&#8217;d out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat,
fat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!<br>
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?<br>
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?<br>
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">O, they were all in lamentable cases!<br>
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Biron did swear himself out of all suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Dumain was at my service, and his sword:<br>
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Longaville said, I came o&#8217;er his
heart;<br>
And trow you what he called me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>

<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, in good faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Go, sickness as thou art!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Well, better wits have worn plain
statute-caps.<br>
But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">And Longaville was for my service born.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:<br>
Immediately they will again be here<br>
In their own shapes; for it can never be<br>
They will digest this harsh indignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Will they return?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;They will, they will, God
knows,<br>
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:<br>
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,<br>
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Fair ladies mask&#8217;d are roses in their
bud;<br>
Dismask&#8217;d, their damask sweet commixture shown,<br>
Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,<br>
If they return in their own shapes to woo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Good madam, if by me you&#8217;ll be advised,<br>
Let&#8217;s, mock them still, as well known as disguised:<br>
Let us complain to them what fools were here,<br>
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;<br>
And wonder what they were and to what end<br>
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn&#8217;d<br>
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,<br>
Should be presented at our tent to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Whip to our tents, as roes run o&#8217;er
land.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Princess, Rosaline,
Katharine, and Maria</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty<br>
Command me any service to her thither?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,<br>
And utters it again when God doth please:<br>
He is wit&#8217;s pedler, and retails his wares<br>
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;<br>
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,<br>
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.<br>
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;<br>
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;<br>
A&#8217; can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he<br>
That kiss&#8217;d his hand away in courtesy;<br>
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,<br>
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice<br>
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing<br>
A mean most meanly; and in ushering<br>
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;<br>
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:<br>
This is the flower that smiles on every one,<br>
To show his teeth as white as whale&#8217;s bone;<br>
And consciences, that will not die in debt,<br>
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,<br>
That put Armado&#8217;s page out of his part!</p>

<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Fair&#8217; in &#8216;all hail&#8217; is
foul, as I conceive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Construe my speeches better, if you may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Then wish me better; I will give you leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">We came to visit you, and purpose now<br>
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">This field shall hold me; and so hold your
vow:<br>
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:<br>
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">You nickname virtue; vice you should have
spoke;<br>
For virtue&#8217;s office never breaks men&#8217;s troth.<br>
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure<br>
As the unsullied lily, I protest,<br>
A world of torments though I should endure,<br>
I would not yield to be your house&#8217;s guest;<br>
So much I hate a breaking cause to be<br>
Of heavenly oaths, vow&#8217;d with integrity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">O, you have lived in desolation here,<br>
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;<br>
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:<br>
A mess of Russians left us but of late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">How, madam! Russians!</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, in truth, my lord;<br>
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:<br>
My lady, to the manner of the days,<br>
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.<br>
We four indeed confronted were with four<br>
In Russian habit: here they stay&#8217;d an hour,<br>
And talk&#8217;d apace; and in that hour, my lord,<br>
They did not bless us with one happy word.<br>
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,<br>
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,<br>
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,<br>
With eyes best seeing, heaven&#8217;s fiery eye,<br>
By light we lose light: your capacity<br>
Is of that nature that to your huge store<br>
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">This proves you wise and rich, for in my
eye,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I am a fool, and full of poverty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">But that you take what doth to you belong,<br>
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am yours, and all that I possess!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">All the fool mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot give you less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Which of the vizards was it that you wore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Where? when? what vizard? why demand you
this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">There, then, that vizard; that superfluous
case<br>
That hid the worse and show&#8217;d the better face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">We are descried; they&#8217;ll mock us now
downright.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Let us confess and turn it to a jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Help, hold his brows! he&#8217;ll swoon! Why look
you pale?<br>
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.<br>
Can any face of brass hold longer out?<br>
Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;<br>
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;<br>
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;<br>
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;<br>
And I will wish thee never more to dance,<br>
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.<br>
O, never will I trust to speeches penn&#8217;d,<br>
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy&#8217;s tongue,<br>
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,<br>
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper&#8217;s song!<br>
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,<br>
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,<br>
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies<br>
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:<br>
I do forswear them; and I here protest,<br>
By this white glove;&#8212;how white the hand, God
knows!&#8212;<br>
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express&#8217;d<br>
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:<br>
And, to begin, wench,&#8212;so God help me, la!&#8212;<br>
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Sans sans, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Yet I have a trick<br>
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;<br>
I&#8217;ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:<br>
Write, &#8216;Lord have mercy on us&#8217; on those three;<br>
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;<br>
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;<br>
These lords are visited; you are not free,<br>
For the Lord&#8217;s tokens on you do I see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">No, they are free that gave these tokens to
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">It is not so; for how can this be true,<br>
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! for I will not have to do with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude
transgression<br>
Some fair excuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The fairest is confession.<br>
Were not you here but even now disguised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And were you well advised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I was, fair madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;When you then were here,<br>
What did you whisper in your lady&#8217;s ear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">That more than all the world I did respect
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">When she shall challenge this, you will reject
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace! forbear:<br>
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,<br>
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear<br>
As precious eyesight, and did value me<br>
Above this world; adding thereto moreover<br>
That he would wed me, or else die my lover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">God give thee joy of him! the noble lord<br>
Most honourably doth unhold his word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,<br>
I never swore this lady such an oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,<br>
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">My faith and this the princess I did give:<br>
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;<br>
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.<br>
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Neither of either; I remit both twain.<br>
I see the trick on&#8217;t: here was a consent,<br>
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<br>
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:<br>
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,<br>
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,<br>
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick<br>
To make my lady laugh when she&#8217;s disposed,<br>
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,<br>
The ladies did change favours: and then we,<br>
Following the signs, woo&#8217;d but the sign of she.<br>
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,<br>
We are again forsworn, in will and error.<br>
Much upon this it is: and might not you</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speech">Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?<br>
Do not you know my lady&#8217;s foot by the squier,<br>
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?<br>
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,<br>
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?<br>
You put our page out: go, you are allow&#8217;d;<br>
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.<br>
You leer upon me, do you? there&#8217;s an eye<br>
Wounds like a leaden sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Full merrily<br>
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have
done.</p>

<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, they would know<br>
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">What, are there but three?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; but it is vara fine,<br>
For every one pursents three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">And three times thrice is nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is
not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Is not nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth
amount.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your
living
by reckoning, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">How much is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the
actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou one of the Worthies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion
the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Go, bid them prepare.</p>

policy<br>
To have one show worse than the king&#8217;s and his company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I say they shall not come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, my good lord, let me o&#8217;errule you
now:<br>
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:<br>
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents<br>
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:<br>
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,<br>
When great things labouring perish in their birth.</p>

Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus:<br>
And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,<br>
These four will change habits, and present the other five.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">There is five in the first show.</p>

For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,<br>
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe<br>
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide<br>
The liberal opposition of our spirits,<br>
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves<br>
In the converse of breath: your gentleness<br>
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!<br>
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:<br>
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks<br>
For my great suit so easily obtain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

All causes to the purpose of his speed,<br>
And often at his very loose decides<br>
That which long process could not arbitrate:<br>
And though the mourning brow of progeny<br>
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love<br>
The holy suit which fain it would convince,<br>
Yet, since love&#8217;s argument was first on foot,<br>
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it<br>
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost<br>
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable<br>
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.</p>

grief;<br>
And by these badges understand the king.<br>
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,<br>
Play&#8217;d foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,<br>
Hath much deform&#8217;d us, fashioning our humours<br>
Even to the opposed end of our intents:<br>
And what in us hath seem&#8217;d ridiculous,&#8212;<br>
As love is full of unbefitting strains,<br>
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,<br>
Form&#8217;d by the eye and therefore, like the eye,<br>
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,<br>
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll<br>
To every varied object in his glance:<br>
Which parti-coated presence of loose love<br>
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,<br>
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,<br>
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,<br>
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,<br>
Our love being yours, the error that love makes<br>
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,<br>
By being once false for ever to be true<br>
To those that make us both,&#8212;fair ladies, you:<br>
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,<br>
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We have received your letters full of love;<br>
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;<br>
And, in our maiden council, rated them<br>
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,<br>
As bombast and as lining to the time:<br>
But more devout than this in our respects<br>
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves<br>
In their own fashion, like a merriment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Our letters, madam, show&#8217;d much more than
jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">So did our looks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We did not quote them so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Now, at the latest minute of the hour,<br>
Grant us your loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">A time, methinks, too short<br>
To make a world-without-end bargain in.<br>
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,<br>
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:<br>
If for my love, as there is no such cause,<br>
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:<br>
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed<br>
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,<br>
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;<br>
There stay until the twelve celestial signs<br>
Have brought about the annual reckoning.<br>
If this austere insociable life<br>
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;<br>
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds<br>
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,<br>
But that it bear this trial and last love;<br>
Then, at the expiration of the year,<br>
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,<br>
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine<br>
I will be thine; and till that instant shut<br>
My woeful self up in a mourning house,<br>
Raining the tears of lamentation<br>
For the remembrance of my father&#8217;s death.<br>
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,<br>
Neither entitled in the other&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">If this, or more than this, I would deny,<br>
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,<br>
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!<br>
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">But what to me, my love? but what to me? A
wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A beard, fair health, and honesty;<br>
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day<br>
I&#8217;ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:<br>
Come when the king doth to my lady come;<br>
Then, if I have much love, I&#8217;ll give you some.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll serve thee true and faithfully till
then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">What says Maria?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At the twelvemonth&#8217;s end<br>
I&#8217;ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll stay with patience; but the time is
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">The liker you; few taller are so young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;<br>
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,<br>
What humble suit attends thy answer there:<br>
Impose some service on me for thy love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,<br>
Before I saw you; and the world&#8217;s large tongue<br>
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,<br>
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,<br>
Which you on all estates will execute<br>
That lie within the mercy of your wit.<br>
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,<br>
And therewithal to win me, if you please,<br>
Without the which I am not to be won,<br>
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day<br>
Visit the speechless sick and still converse<br>
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,<br>
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit<br>
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">To move wild laughter in the throat of death?<br>
It cannot be; it is impossible:<br>
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s the way to choke a gibing
spirit,<br>
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace<br>
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:<br>
A jest&#8217;s prosperity lies in the ear<br>
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue<br>
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,<br>
Deaf&#8217;d with the clamours of their own dear groans,<br>
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,<br>
And I will have you and that fault withal;<br>
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,<br>
And I shall find you empty of that fault,<br>
Right joyful of your reformation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,<br>
I&#8217;ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Ferdinand]</span> Ay,
sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam; we will bring you on your way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Our wooing doth not end like an old play;<br>
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies&#8217; courtesy<br>
Might well have made our sport a comedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,<br>
And then &#8217;twill end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s too long for a play.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Don Adriano De
Armado</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Was not that Hector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">The worthy knight of Troy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I
am
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Call them forth quickly; we will do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Holla! approach.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Holofernes, Sir
Nathaniel, Moth, Costard, and others</span></p>
<p class="speech">This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the
Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Song</span></p>
<p class="speech verse">Spring.<br>
When daisies pied and violets blue<br>
And lady-smocks all silver-white<br>
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue<br>
Do paint the meadows with delight,<br>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<br>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;<br>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<br>
Unpleasing to a married ear!<br>
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws<br>
And merry larks are ploughmen&#8217;s clocks,<br>
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,<br>
And maidens bleach their summer smocks<br>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<br>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;<br>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<br>
Unpleasing to a married ear!</p>
<p class="speech verse">
Winter.<br>
When icicles hang by the wall<br>
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail<br>
And Tom bears logs into the hall<br>
And milk comes frozen home in pail,<br>
When blood is nipp&#8217;d and ways be foul,<br>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;<br>
Tu-who, a merry note,<br>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.<br>
When all aloud the wind doth blow<br>
And coughing drowns the parson&#8217;s saw<br>
And birds sit brooding in the snow<br>
And Marian&#8217;s nose looks red and raw,<br>
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,<br>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;<br>
Tu-who, a merry note,<br>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs
of<br>
Apollo. You that way: we this way.</p>
