<h4>Scene I. Friar Laurence&#8217;s cell.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Friar Laurence and
Paris</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">My father Capulet will have it so;<br>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">You say you do not know the lady&#8217;s
mind:<br>
Uneven is the course, I like it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt&#8217;s
death,<br>
And therefore have I little talk&#8217;d of love;<br>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br>
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,<br>
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,<br>
To stop the inundation of her tears;<br>
Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br>
May be put from her by society:<br>
Now do you know the reason of this haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I would I knew
not why it should be slow&#8217;d.<br>
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Juliet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Happily met, my lady and my wife!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What must be shall be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a certain text.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Come you to make confession to this father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">To answer that, I should confess to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Do not deny to him that you love me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I will confess to you that I love him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">If I do so, it will be of more price,<br>
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Poor soul, thy face is much abused with
tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">The tears have got small victory by that;<br>
For it was bad enough before their spite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wrong&#8217;st it, more than tears, with
that report.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;<br>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander&#8217;d
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so, for it is not mine own.<br>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;<br>
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.<br>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">God shield I should disturb devotion!<br>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:<br>
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,<br>
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br>
It strains me past the compass of my wits:<br>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>
On Thursday next be married to this county.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me not, friar, that thou hear&#8217;st of
this,<br>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:<br>
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<br>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br>
And with this knife I&#8217;ll help it presently.<br>
God join&#8217;d my heart and Romeo&#8217;s, thou our hands;<br>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal&#8217;d,<br>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:<br>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,<br>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<br>
&#8217;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<br>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br>
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,<br>
If what thou speak&#8217;st speak not of remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,<br>
Which craves as desperate an execution.<br>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>
If, rather than to marry County Paris,<br>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>
That copest with death himself to scape from it:<br>
And, if thou darest, I&#8217;ll give thee remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>
From off the battlements of yonder tower;<br>
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk<br>
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;<br>
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,<br>
O&#8217;er-cover&#8217;d quite with dead men&#8217;s rattling
bones,<br>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;<br>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;<br>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;<br>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>
To live an unstain&#8217;d wife to my sweet love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent<br>
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:<br>
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:<br>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;<br>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse<br>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:<br>
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<br>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>
To paly ashes, thy eyes&#8217; windows fall,<br>
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;<br>
Each part, deprived of supple government,<br>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:<br>
And in this borrow&#8217;d likeness of shrunk death<br>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<br>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:<br>
Then, as the manner of our country is,<br>
In thy best robes uncover&#8217;d on the bier<br>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<br>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br>
And hither shall he come: and he and I<br>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>
And this shall free thee from this present shame;<br>
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,<br>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous<br>
In this resolve: I&#8217;ll send a friar with speed<br>
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Love give me strength! and strength shall help
afford.<br>
Farewell, dear father!</p>

<p class="speech">You shall have none ill, sir; for I&#8217;ll try
if they
can lick their fingers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou try them so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, &#8217;tis an ill cook that cannot
lick his
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
fingers goes not with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Go, be gone.</p>

Servant</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, forsooth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, he may chance to do some good on her:<br>
A peevish self-will&#8217;d harlotry it is.</p>

look.</p>

<p class="speech">How now, my headstrong! where have you been
gadding?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Where I have learn&#8217;d me to repent the
sin<br>
Of disobedient opposition<br>
To you and your behests, and am enjoin&#8217;d<br>
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,<br>
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!<br>
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Send for the county; go tell him of this:<br>
I&#8217;ll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I met the youthful lord at Laurence&#8217;
cell;<br>
And gave him what becomed love I might,<br>
Not step o&#8217;er the bounds of modesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I am glad on&#8217;t; this is well: stand
up:<br>
This is as&#8217;t should be. Let me see the county;<br>
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.<br>
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,<br>
Our whole city is much bound to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,<br>
To help me sort such needful ornaments<br>
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?</p>

<p class="speech">No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>

to-morrow.</p>

Nurse</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, I will stir about,<br>
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:<br>
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;<br>
I&#8217;ll not to bed to-night; let me alone;<br>
I&#8217;ll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!<br>
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself<br>
To County Paris, to prepare him up<br>
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,<br>
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim&#8217;d.</p>

<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle
nurse,<br>
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,<br>
For I have need of many orisons<br>
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,<br>
Which, well thou know&#8217;st, is cross, and full of sin.</p>

<p class="speech">What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?</p>

<p class="speech">No, madam; we have cull&#8217;d such
necessaries<br>
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:<br>
So please you, let me now be left alone,<br>
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;<br>
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,<br>
In this so sudden business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Good night:<br>
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lady Capulet and
Nurse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.<br>
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,<br>
That almost freezes up the heat of life:<br>
I&#8217;ll call them back again to comfort me:<br>
Nurse! What should she do here?<br>
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.<br>
Come, vial.<br>
What if this mixture do not work at all?<br>
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?<br>
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laying down her
dagger</span></p>
<p class="speech">What if it be a poison, which the friar<br>
Subtly hath minister&#8217;d to have me dead,<br>
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour&#8217;d,<br>
Because he married me before to Romeo?<br>
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,<br>
For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br>
I wake before the time that Romeo<br>
Come to redeem me? there&#8217;s a fearful point!<br>
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,<br>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br>
Or, if I live, is it not very like,<br>
The horrible conceit of death and night,<br>
Together with the terror of the place,&#8212;<br>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,<br>
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones<br>
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:<br>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,<br>
At some hours in the night spirits resort;&#8212;<br>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br>
And shrieks like mandrakes&#8217; torn out of the earth,<br>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:&#8212;<br>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br>
Environed with all these hideous fears?<br>
And madly play with my forefather&#8217;s joints?<br>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?<br>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman&#8217;s bone,<br>
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?<br>
O, look! methinks I see my cousin&#8217;s ghost<br>
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body<br>
Upon a rapier&#8217;s point: stay, Tybalt, stay!<br>
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.</p>

In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!<br>
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,<br>
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,<br>
And cruel death hath catch&#8217;d it from my sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!<br>
Most lamentable day, most woful day,<br>
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!<br>
O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!<br>
Never was seen so black a day as this:<br>
O woful day, O woful day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!<br>
Most detestable death, by thee beguil&#8217;d,<br>
By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!<br>
O love! O life! not life, but love in death!</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Despised, distressed, hated, martyr&#8217;d,
kill&#8217;d!<br>
Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now<br>
To murder, murder our solemnity?<br>
O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!<br>
Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;<br>
And with my child my joys are buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho, for shame! confusion&#8217;s cure
lives not<br>
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself<br>
Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,<br>
And all the better is it for the maid:<br>
Your part in her you could not keep from death,<br>
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.<br>
The most you sought was her promotion;<br>
For &#8217;twas your heaven she should be advanced:<br>
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced<br>
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?<br>
O, in this love, you love your child so ill,<br>
That you run mad, seeing that she is well:<br>
She&#8217;s not well married that lives married long;<br>
But she&#8217;s best married that dies married young.<br>
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary<br>
On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,<br>
In all her best array bear her to church:<br>
For though fond nature bids us an lament,<br>
Yet nature&#8217;s tears are reason&#8217;s merriment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">All things that we ordained festival,<br>
Turn from their office to black funeral;<br>
Our instruments to melancholy bells,<br>
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,<br>
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,<br>
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,<br>
And all things change them to the contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;<br>
And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare<br>
To follow this fair corse unto her grave:<br>
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;<br>
Move them no more by crossing their high will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet,
Paris, and Friar Laurence</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;<br>
For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Peter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Musicians, O, musicians, &#8216;Heart&#8217;s
ease, Heart&#8217;s
ease:&#8217; O, an you will have me live, play &#8216;Heart&#8217;s
ease.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Why &#8216;Heart&#8217;s ease?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">O, musicians, because my heart itself plays
&#8216;My
heart is full of woe:&#8217; O, play me some merry dump,
to comfort me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Not a dump we; &#8217;tis no time to play
now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">You will not, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">I will then give it you soundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">What will you give us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">No money, on my faith, but the gleek;<br>
I will give you the minstrel.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Then I will give you the serving-creature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Then will I lay the serving-creature&#8217;s
dagger on
your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I&#8217;ll re you,
I&#8217;ll fa you; do you note me?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">An you re us and fa us, you note us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your
wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat
you
with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
me like men:<br>
&#8216;When griping grief the heart doth wound,<br>
And doleful dumps the mind oppress,<br>
Then music with her silver sound&#8217;&#8212;<br>
why &#8216;silver sound&#8217;? why &#8216;music with her
silver
sound&#8217;? What say you, Simon Catling?</p>
<p class="speaker">Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet
sound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Musician</p>
<p class="speech">I say &#8216;silver sound,&#8217; because
musicians sound for silver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I know not what to say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will
say
for you. It is &#8216;music with her silver sound,&#8217;
because musicians have no gold for sounding:
&#8216;Then music with her silver sound
With speedy help doth lend redress.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Musician</p>
<p class="speech">What a pestilent knave is this same!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Musician</p>
<p class="speech">Hang him, Jack! Come, we&#8217;ll in here; tarry
for the
mourners, and stay dinner.</p>
