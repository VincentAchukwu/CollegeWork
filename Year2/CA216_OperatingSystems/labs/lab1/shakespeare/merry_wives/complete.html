<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Shallow, Slender, and
Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a
Star-chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace
and
&#8216;Coram.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, cousin Slender, and &#8216;Custalourum&#8217;.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and &#8216;Rato-lorum&#8217; too; and a
gentleman born,
master parson; who writes himself &#8216;Armigero,&#8217; in
any
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation,
&#8216;Armigero.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that I do; and have done any time these
three
hundred years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">All his successors gone before him hath
done&#8217;t; and
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
give the dozen white luces in their coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">It is an old coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">The dozen white louses do become an old coat
well;
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
man, and signifies love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an
old coat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I may quarter, coz.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">You may, by marrying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, py&#8217;r lady; if he has a quarter of your
coat,
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
benevolence to make atonements and compremises
between you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The council shall bear it; it is a riot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is
no
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
riot; take your vizaments in that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! o&#8217; my life, if I were young again, the
sword
should end it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is petter that friends is the sword, and end
it:
and there is also another device in my prain, which
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
Page, which is pretty virginity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and
speaks
small like a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is that fery person for all the orld, as just
as
you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
death&#8217;s-bed&#8212;Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
&#8212;give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred
pound?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and her father is make her a petter
penny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I know the young gentlewoman; she has good
gifts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot
gifts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff
there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I
do
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
peat the door for Master Page.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Knocks</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, hoa! Got pless your house here!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Here is Got&#8217;s plessing, and your friend,
and Justice
Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
matters grow to your likings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to see your worships well.<br>
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do

was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?&#8212;and I
thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>

<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say
he
was outrun on Cotsall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">It could not be judged, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll not confess, you&#8217;ll not
confess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">That he will not. &#8217;Tis your fault,
&#8217;tis your fault;<br>
&#8217;tis a good dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">A cur, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he&#8217;s a good dog, and a fair dog: can
there be
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
Falstaff here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a
good
office between you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">He hath wronged me, Master Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">If it be confessed, it is not redress&#8217;d: is
not that
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Sir John.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Master Shallow, you&#8217;ll complain of me
to the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer,
and
broke open my lodge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">But not kissed your keeper&#8217;s daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I will answer it straight; I have done all
this.<br>
That is now answered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">The council shall know this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere better for you if it were known in
counsel:
you&#8217;ll be laughed at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke
your
head: what matter have you against me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against
you;
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
Nym, and Pistol.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">You Banbury cheese!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, it is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Mephostophilus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, it is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that&#8217;s
my humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Simple, my man? Can you tell,
cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There
is
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">We three, to hear it and end it between them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my
note-book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
as great discreetly as we can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Pistol!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">He hears with ears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this,
&#8216;He
hears with ear&#8217;? why, it is affectations.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Pistol, did you pick Master Slender&#8217;s
purse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I
might
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Is this true, Pistol?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master
mine,<br>
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.<br>
Word of denial in thy labras here!<br>
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">By these gloves, then, &#8217;twas he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will
say
&#8217;marry trap&#8217; with you, if you run the
nuthook&#8217;s
humour on me; that is the very note of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">By this hat, then, he in the red face had it;
for
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, Scarlet and John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had
drunk
himself out of his five sentences.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance
is!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered;
and
so conclusions passed the careires.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but &#8217;tis
no
matter: I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be drunk whilst I live again,
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
if I be drunk, I&#8217;ll be drunk with those that have
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you
hear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Anne Page, with wine;
Mistress Ford and Mistress Page, following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we&#8217;ll
drink within.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Anne Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Mistress Ford!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well
met:
by your leave, good mistress.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kisses her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have
a
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
we shall drink down all unkindness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except Shallow,
Slender, and Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book
of<br>
Songs and Sonnets here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Simple</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Simple! where have you been? I must
wait
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
about you, have you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to
Alice
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
afore Michaelmas?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word
with
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as &#8217;twere, a
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
here. Do you understand me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be
so,<br>
I shall do that that is reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but understand me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">So I do, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I
will
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I
pray
you, pardon me; he&#8217;s a justice of peace in his
country, simple though I stand here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">But that is not the question: the question is
concerning your marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there&#8217;s the point, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress
Anne Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
reasonable demands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">But can you affection the &#8217;oman? Let us
command to
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
good will to the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one
that
would do reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, Got&#8217;s lords and his ladies! you must
speak
possitable, if you can carry her your desires
towards her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I will do a greater thing than that, upon
your
request, cousin, in any reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I
do
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if
there
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
married and have more occasion to know one another;
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
but if you say, &#8216;Marry her,&#8217; I will marry her; that
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is
in
the ort &#8216;dissolutely:&#8217; the ort is, according to our
meaning, &#8216;resolutely:&#8217; his meaning is good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I think my cousin meant well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes fair Mistress Anne.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Anne Page</span></p>
<p class="speech">Would I were young for your sake, Mistress

<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather walk here, I thank you. I
bruised
my shin th&#8217; other day with playing at sword and
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
dogs bark so? be there bears i&#8217; the town?</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">I think there are, sir; I heard them talked
of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel
at
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
the bear loose, are you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, indeed, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s meat and drink to me, now. I have
seen
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
indeed, cannot abide &#8217;em; they are very ill-favored
rough things.</p>

<p class="speech">No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist
two
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford&#8217;s
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
can construe the action of her familiar style; and
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
rightly, is, &#8216;I am Sir John Falstaff&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

another to Page&#8217;s wife, who even now gave me good
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
foot, sometimes my portly belly.</p>

such a

seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here&#8217;s
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
be cheater to them both, and they shall be
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou

<p class="speech">What, have I scaped love-letters in the
holiday-time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
Let me see.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Ask me no reason why I love you; for
though
Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
am I; go to then, there&#8217;s sympathy: you are merry,
so am I; ha, ha! then there&#8217;s more sympathy: you
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,&#8212;at
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,&#8212;
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; &#8217;tis
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,<br>
Thine own true knight,<br>
By day or night,<br>
Or any kind of light,<br>
With all his might<br>
For thee to fight, John Falstaff&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
age to show himself a young gallant! What an
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
picked&#8212;with the devil&#8217;s name!&#8212;out of my
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I&#8217;ll exhibit a bill
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your
house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look
very
ill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er believe that; I have
to show to the contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, but you do, in my mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to
the
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter, woman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect,
I
could come to such honour!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What
is
it? dispense with trifles; what is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment
or so,<br>
I could be knighted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These
knights
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
article of thy gentry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how
I
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
men&#8217;s liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
women&#8217;s modesty; and gave such orderly and
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
the tune of &#8216;Green Sleeves.&#8217; What tempest, I trow,
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Letter for letter, but that the name of Page
and
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
of ill opinions, here&#8217;s the twin-brother of thy
letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
different names&#8212;sure, more,&#8212;and these are of the
second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the
very
words. What doth he think of us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
wrangle with mine own honesty. I&#8217;ll entertain
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Boarding,&#8217; call you it? I&#8217;ll
be sure to keep him
above deck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">So will I if he come under my hatches, I&#8217;ll

appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I will consent to act any villany against
him,

eternal food to his jealousy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>

<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Hang &#8217;em, slaves! I do not think the knight

<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this
voyage

what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it

<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath

<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, this is the short and the long of it;
you
have brought her into such a canaries as &#8217;tis
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
the best and the fairest, that would have won any
woman&#8217;s heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">But what says she to me? be brief, my good
she-Mercury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, she hath received your letter, for the
which
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
to notify that her husband will be absence from his
house between ten and eleven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ten and eleven?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see
the
picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
woman leads an ill life with him: he&#8217;s a very
jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
him, good heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I
will
not fail her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you say well. But I have another messenger
to
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
your ear, she&#8217;s as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe&#8217;er be the
other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of
my
good parts aside I have no other charms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Blessing on your heart for&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

wife and<br>
Page&#8217;s wife acquainted each other how they love me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">That were a jest indeed! they have not so
little
grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
little page, of all loves: her husband has a
marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
send her your page; no remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come
and
go between you both; and in any case have a
nay-word, that you may know one another&#8217;s mind, and
the boy never need to understand any thing; for
&#8217;tis not good that children should know any
wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
as they say, and know the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well: commend me to them both:
there&#8217;s
my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
this woman.</p>

<p class="speech">Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge
you;
for I must let you understand I think myself in
better plight for a lender than you are: the which
hath something embolden&#8217;d me to this unseasoned
intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
ways do lie open.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles
me:
if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
half, for easing me of the carriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your
porter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the
hearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to
be
your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I hear you are a scholar,&#8212;I will be
brief
with you,&#8212;and you have been a man long known to me,
though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
turn another into the register of your own; that I
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Very well, sir; proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">There is a gentlewoman in this town; her
husband&#8217;s
name is Ford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
fee&#8217;d every slight occasion that could but niggardly
give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
to give her, but have given largely to many to know
what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
rate, and that hath taught me to say this:</p>
<p class="speech quote">
&#8216;Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;<br>
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Have you received no promise of satisfaction at
her hands?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Never.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Have you importuned her to such a purpose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Never.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Of what quality was your love, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Like a fair house built on another man&#8217;s
ground; so
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
where I erected it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">When I have told you that, I have told you
all.
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
place and person, generally allowed for your many
war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Believe it, for you know it. There is money;
spend
it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
Ford&#8217;s wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely
on
the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
with any detection in my hand, my desires had
instance and argument to commend themselves: I
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
other her defences, which now are too too strongly
embattled against me. What say you to&#8217;t, Sir John?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Brook, I will first make bold with
your
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">O good sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I say you shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall
want
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
know how I speed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know
Ford,
sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him
not:
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue&#8217;s coffer;
and there&#8217;s my harvest-home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid
him
if you saw him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I
will
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o&#8217;er the
cuckold&#8217;s horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
Ford&#8217;s a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart
is
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
have thought this? See the hell of having a false
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
devils&#8217; additions, the names of fiends: but
Cuckold! Wittol!&#8212;Cuckold! the devil himself hath
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
think in their hearts they may effect, they will
break their hearts but they will effect. God be
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o&#8217;clock the hour.
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!</p>

I
politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay

<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for
want
of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
you two would marry.</p>

<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff!</p>

<p class="speech">He, he; I can never hit on&#8217;s name. There is
such a

home indeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>

Robin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he
any
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
score. He pieces out his wife&#8217;s inclination; he
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she&#8217;s
going to my wife, and Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her. A
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
my neighbours shall cry aim.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clock heard</span></p>
<p class="speech">The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids
me
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
there: I will go.</p>

more money than I&#8217;ll speak of.</p>

and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with
me
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.</p>

<p class="speech">I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a
pitiful lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
Venetian admittance.</p>

<p class="speech">A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become
nothing
else; nor that well neither.</p>

<p class="speech">By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so:
thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion

hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
if it were going to bucking: or&#8212;it is whiting-time

Besides these, other bars he lays before me,<br>

give
them to a dog for a new-year&#8217;s gift. The rogues

they would have drowned a blind bitch&#8217;s puppies,
fifteen i&#8217; the litter: and you may know by my size
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had

between me and Ford&#8217;s wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at
her
house the hour she appointed me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And sped you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">How so, sir? Did she change her
determination?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
&#8217;larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
forsooth, to search his house for his wife&#8217;s love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What, while you were there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">While I was there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And did he search for you, and could not find
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You shall hear. As good luck would have it,
comes
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford&#8217;s
approach; and, in her invention and Ford&#8217;s wife&#8217;s
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">A buck-basket!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with
foul
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And how long lay you there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I
have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,&#8212;a
man of my kidney,&#8212;think of that,&#8212;that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,&#8212;hissing hot,&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake
you
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
you&#8217;ll undertake her no more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I
have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
received from her another embassy of meeting; &#8217;twixt
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis past eight already, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Is it? I will then address me to my
appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
cuckold Ford.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do
I
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
there&#8217;s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
This &#8217;tis to be married! this &#8217;tis to have linen
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
house; he cannot &#8217;scape me; &#8217;tis impossible he
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
guides him should aid him, I will search
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
with me: I&#8217;ll be horn-mad.</p>

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
and I profess requital to a hair&#8217;s breadth; not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
sure of your husband now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a-birding, sweet Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> What, ho,

<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">How now, sweetheart! who&#8217;s at home besides
yourself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, none but mine own people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">No, certainly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside to her</span></p>
<p class="speech">Speak louder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes
again:
he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
against all married mankind; so curses all Eve&#8217;s
daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
himself on the forehead, crying, &#8216;Peer out, peer
out!&#8217; that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
tameness, civility and patience, to this his
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, does he talk of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Of none but him; and swears he was carried out,
the
last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
the rest of their company from their sport, to make
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">How near is he, Mistress Page?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I am undone! The knight is here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why then you are utterly shamed, and he&#8217;s
but a dead
man. What a woman are you!&#8212;Away with him, away
with him! better shame than murder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Which way should be go? how should I bestow
him?<br>
Shall I put him into the basket again?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll come no more i&#8217; the basket.
May I not go
out ere he come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, three of Master Ford&#8217;s brothers watch
the door
with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I do? I&#8217;ll creep up into the
chimney.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Where is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">He will seek there, on my word. Neither
press,
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll go out then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">If you go out in your own semblance, you die,
Sir<br>
John. Unless you go out disguised&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">How might we disguise him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Alas the day, I know not! There is no
woman&#8217;s gown
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Good hearts, devise something: any extremity
rather
than a mischief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">My maid&#8217;s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford,
has a
gown above.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">On my word, it will serve him; she&#8217;s as big
as he
is: and there&#8217;s her thrummed hat and her muffler
too. Run up, Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I
will
look some linen for your head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Quick, quick! we&#8217;ll come dress you
straight: put
on the gown the while.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I would my husband would meet him in this shape:
he
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
she&#8217;s a witch; forbade her my house and hath
threatened to beat her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven guide him to thy husband&#8217;s cudgel,
and the
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">But is my husband coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the
basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll try that; for I&#8217;ll appoint my
men to carry the
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
they did last time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but he&#8217;ll be here presently:
let&#8217;s go dress him
like the witch of Brentford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll first direct my men what they shall do
with the
basket. Go up; I&#8217;ll bring linen for him straight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you
any

villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
O you panderly rascals! there&#8217;s a knot, a ging, a
pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to
go
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad

<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>

without cause, mistress, do I?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me
in
any dishonesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>

<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I shall find you anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your

<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Empty the basket, I say!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Master Page, as I am a man, there was one
conveyed
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">If you find a man there, he shall die a
flea&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>

this

<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow
the
imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well, he&#8217;s not here I seek for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Help to search my house this one time. If I
find
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
me, &#8216;As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
walnut for his wife&#8217;s leman.&#8217; Satisfy me once more;
once more search with me.</p>

<p class="speech">Nay, it is my maid&#8217;s aunt of Brentford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I
not
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
she? We are simple men; we do not know what&#8217;s
brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
you hag, you; come down, I say!</p>

<p class="speech">By the yea and no, I think the &#8217;oman is a

I spy a great peard under his muffler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>

most
unpitifully, methought.</p>

womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
pursue him with any further revenge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out
of
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
way of waste, attempt us again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Shall we tell our husbands how we have served
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
figures out of your husband&#8217;s brains. If they can

<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">There is an old tale goes that Herne the
hunter,<br>
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<br>
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,<br>
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg&#8217;d horns;<br>
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle<br>
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain<br>
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:<br>
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<br>
The superstitious idle-headed eld<br>
Received and did deliver to our age<br>
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>

come:<br>
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,<br>
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:<br>
Nan Page my daughter and my little son<br>
And three or four more of their growth we&#8217;ll dress<br>
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,<br>
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,<br>
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,<br>
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,<br>
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once<br>
With some diffused song: upon their sight,<br>
We two in great amazedness will fly:<br>
Then let them all encircle him about<br>
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,<br>
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,<br>
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread<br>
In shape profane.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And till he tell the truth,<br>
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound<br>
And burn him with their tapers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>

We&#8217;ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,<br>

one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
chain or no.</p>

the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
drop and liquor fishermen&#8217;s boots with me; I warrant
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered

of man&#8217;s disposition is able to bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
white spot about her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i&#8217; the
stocks, i&#8217; the common stocks, for a witch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber:
you

Of such contents as you will wonder at;<br>
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,<br>
That neither singly can be manifested,<br>
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff<br>
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest<br>

To-night at Herne&#8217;s oak, just &#8217;twixt twelve and

The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,<br>
While other jests are something rank on foot,<br>
Her father hath commanded her to slip<br>
Away with Slender and with him at Eton<br>
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,<br>
Her mother, ever strong against that match<br>
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed<br>
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,<br>
While other sports are tasking of their minds,<br>
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,<br>
Straight marry her: to this her mother&#8217;s plot<br>
She seemingly obedient likewise hath<br>
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:<br>
Her father means she shall be all in white,<br>
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<br>
To take her by the hand and bid her go,<br>
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,<br>
The better to denote her to the doctor,<br>
For they must all be mask&#8217;d and vizarded,<br>
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,<br>
With ribands pendent, flaring &#8217;bout her head;<br>
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,<br>
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,<br>
The maid hath given consent to go with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Which means she to deceive, father or mother?</p>

And here it rests, that you&#8217;ll procure the vicar<br>
To stay for me at church &#8217;twixt twelve and one,<br>
And, in the lawful name of marrying,<br>
To give our hearts united ceremony.</p>

Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
not Goliath with a weaver&#8217;s beam; because I know
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along

<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!<br>
About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;<br>
And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.<br>
Song.<br>
Fie on sinful fantasy!<br>
Fie on lust and luxury!<br>
Lust is but a bloody fire,<br>
Kindled with unchaste desire,<br>
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire<br>
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.<br>
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;<br>
Pinch him for his villany;<br>
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,<br>
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">During this song they pinch
Falstaff. Doctor Caius comes one way, and steals away a boy in
green; Slender another way, and takes off a boy in white; and
Fenton comes and steals away Ann Page. A noise of hunting is heard
within. All the Fairies run away. Falstaff pulls off his
buck&#8217;s head, and rises</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Page, Ford, Mistress
Page, and Mistress Ford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch&#8217;d
you now<br>
Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher<br>
Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?<br>
See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes<br>
Become the forest better than the town?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, who&#8217;s a cuckold now? Master
Brook,
Falstaff&#8217;s a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
enjoyed nothing of Ford&#8217;s but his buck-basket, his
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
it, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never
meet.
I will never take you for my love again; but I will
always count you my deer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are
extant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And these are not fairies? I was three or
four
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when &#8217;tis upon
ill employment!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, fairy Hugh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I will never mistrust my wife again till thou
art
able to woo her in good English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it,
that
it wants matter to prevent so gross o&#8217;erreaching as
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
have a coxcomb of frize? &#8217;Tis time I were choked
with a piece of toasted cheese.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is
all putter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;seese&#8217; and &#8216;putter&#8217;!
have I lived to stand at the
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
through the realm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have
the
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">A puffed man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Old, cold, withered and of intolerable
entrails?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And one that is as slanderous as Satan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">And as poor as Job?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And as wicked as his wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">And given to fornications, and to taverns and
sack
and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me;
I
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o&#8217;er me: use
me as you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, we&#8217;ll bring you to Windsor, to
one
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
whom you should have been a pander: over and above
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
will be a biting affliction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a
posset
to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
Master Slender hath married her daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Doctors doubt
that: if Anne Page be my
daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius&#8217; wife.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Slender</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Whoa ho! ho, father Page!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Son, how now! how now, son! have you
dispatched?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">Dispatched! I&#8217;ll make the best in
Gloucestershire
know on&#8217;t; would I were hanged, la, else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Of what, son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne
Page,
and she&#8217;s a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
i&#8217; the church, I would have swinged him, or he
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!&#8212;and &#8217;tis
a postmaster&#8217;s boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">What need you tell me that? I think so, when I
took
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
all he was in woman&#8217;s apparel, I would not have had
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you
how
you should know my daughter by her garments?</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I went to her in white, and cried
&#8217;mum,&#8217; and she
cried &#8216;budget,&#8217; as Anne and I had appointed; and
yet
it was not Anne, but a postmaster&#8217;s boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Good George, be not angry: I knew of your
purpose;
turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Doctor Caius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor Caius</p>
<p class="speech">Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I
ha&#8217;
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, did you take her in green?</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor Caius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by gar, and &#8217;tis a boy: by gar,
I&#8217;ll raise all Windsor.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">My heart misgives me: here comes Master
Fenton.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Fenton and Anne
Page</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Master Fenton!</p>
<p class="speaker">Anne Page</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Now, mistress, how chance you went not with
Master Slender?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why went you not with master doctor, maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fenton</p>
<p class="speech">You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.<br>
You would have married her most shamefully,<br>
Where there was no proportion held in love.<br>
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,<br>
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.<br>
The offence is holy that she hath committed;<br>
And this deceit loses the name of craft,<br>
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,<br>
Since therein she doth evitate and shun<br>
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,<br>
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:<br>
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;<br>
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad, though you have ta&#8217;en a special
stand to
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee
joy!<br>
What cannot be eschew&#8217;d must be embraced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are
chased.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,<br>
Heaven give you many, many merry days!<br>
Good husband, let us every one go home,<br>
And laugh this sport o&#8217;er by a country fire;<br>
Sir John and all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Let it be so. Sir John,<br>
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word<br>
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
