<h4>Scene I. King Lear&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Kent, Gloucester, and
Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I thought the king had more affected the Duke
of<br>
Albany than Cornwall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
of either&#8217;s moiety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this your son, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I
have
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
brazed to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot conceive you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, this young fellow&#8217;s mother could:
whereupon
she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
Do you smell a fault?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of
it
being so proper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some
year
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
though this knave came something saucily into the
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
noble gentleman, Edmund?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
honourable friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">My services to your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I must love you, and sue to know you better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall study deserving.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He hath been out nine years, and away he
shall
again. The king is coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Enter King Lear,
Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Attend the lords of France and Burgundy,
Gloucester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I shall, my liege.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gloucester and
Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.<br>
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided<br>
In three our kingdom: and &#8217;tis our fast intent<br>
To shake all cares and business from our age;<br>
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we<br>
Unburthen&#8217;d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,<br>
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,<br>
We have this hour a constant will to publish<br>
Our daughters&#8217; several dowers, that future strife<br>
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,<br>
Great rivals in our youngest daughter&#8217;s love,<br>
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,<br>
And here are to be answer&#8217;d. Tell me, my
daughters,&#8212;<br>
Since now we will divest us both of rule,<br>
Interest of territory, cares of state,&#8212;<br>
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?<br>
That we our largest bounty may extend<br>
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,<br>
Our eldest-born, speak first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I love you more than words can wield the
matter;<br>
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;<br>
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;<br>
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;<br>
As much as child e&#8217;er loved, or father found;<br>
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;<br>
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What shall
Cordelia do?<br>
Love, and be silent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Of all these bounds, even from this line to
this,<br>
With shadowy forests and with champains rich&#8217;d,<br>
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,<br>
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany&#8217;s issue<br>
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,<br>
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I am made<br>
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,<br>
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart<br>
I find she names my very deed of love;<br>
Only she comes too short: that I profess<br>
Myself an enemy to all other joys,<br>
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;<br>
And find I am alone felicitate<br>
In your dear highness&#8217; love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Then poor
Cordelia!<br>
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love&#8217;s<br>
More richer than my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">To thee and thine hereditary ever<br>
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;<br>
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,<br>
Than that conferr&#8217;d on Goneril. Now, our joy,<br>
Although the last, not least; to whose young love<br>
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy<br>
Strive to be interess&#8217;d; what can you say to draw<br>
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave<br>
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty<br>
According to my bond; nor more nor less.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a
little,<br>
Lest it may mar your fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,<br>
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I<br>
Return those duties back as are right fit,<br>
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.<br>
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say<br>
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,<br>
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry<br>
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:<br>
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,<br>
To love my father all.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">But goes thy heart with this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">So young, and so untender?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">So young, my lord, and true.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:<br>
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,<br>
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;<br>
By all the operation of the orbs<br>
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;<br>
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,<br>
Propinquity and property of blood,<br>
And as a stranger to my heart and me<br>
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,<br>
Or he that makes his generation messes<br>
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom<br>
Be as well neighbour&#8217;d, pitied, and relieved,<br>
As thou my sometime daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Good my liege,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, Kent!<br>
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.<br>
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest<br>
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!<br>
So be my grave my peace, as here I give<br>
Her father&#8217;s heart from her! Call France; who stirs?<br>
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,<br>
With my two daughters&#8217; dowers digest this third:<br>
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.<br>
I do invest you jointly with my power,<br>
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects<br>
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,<br>
With reservation of an hundred knights,<br>
By you to be sustain&#8217;d, shall our abode<br>
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain<br>
The name, and all the additions to a king;<br>
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,<br>
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,<br>
This coronet part betwixt you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving the crown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Royal Lear,<br>
Whom I have ever honour&#8217;d as my king,<br>
Loved as my father, as my master follow&#8217;d,<br>
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">The bow is bent and drawn, make from the
shaft.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Let it fall rather, though the fork invade<br>
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,<br>
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?<br>
Think&#8217;st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,<br>
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour&#8217;s bound,<br>
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;<br>
And, in thy best consideration, cheque<br>
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,<br>
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;<br>
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound<br>
Reverbs no hollowness.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Kent, on thy life, no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">My life I never held but as a pawn<br>
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,<br>
Thy safety being the motive.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Out of my sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">See better, Lear; and let me still remain<br>
The true blank of thine eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Apollo,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now, by Apollo, king,<br>
Thou swear&#8217;st thy gods in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O, vassal! miscreant!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laying his hand on his
sword</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Dear sir, forbear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Do:<br>
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow<br>
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;<br>
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee thou dost evil.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, recreant!<br>
On thine allegiance, hear me!<br>
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,<br>
Which we durst never yet, and with strain&#8217;d pride<br>
To come between our sentence and our power,<br>
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,<br>
Our potency made good, take thy reward.<br>
Five days we do allot thee, for provision<br>
To shield thee from diseases of the world;<br>
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back<br>
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,<br>
Thy banish&#8217;d trunk be found in our dominions,<br>
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,<br>
This shall not be revoked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt
appear,<br>
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Cordelia</span></p>
<p class="speech">The gods to their dear shelter take thee,
maid,<br>
That justly think&#8217;st, and hast most rightly said!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Regan and
Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">And your large speeches may your deeds
approve,<br>
That good effects may spring from words of love.<br>
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;<br>
He&#8217;ll shape his old course in a country new.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Re-enter
Gloucester, with King Of France, Burgundy, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s France and Burgundy, my noble
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Burgundy.<br>
We first address towards you, who with this king<br>
Hath rivall&#8217;d for our daughter: what, in the least,<br>
Will you require in present dower with her,<br>
Or cease your quest of love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Most royal majesty,<br>
I crave no more than what your highness offer&#8217;d,<br>
Nor will you tender less.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Right noble Burgundy,<br>
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;<br>
But now her price is fall&#8217;n. Sir, there she stands:<br>
If aught within that little seeming substance,<br>
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,<br>
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,<br>
She&#8217;s there, and she is yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I know no answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Will you, with those infirmities she owes,<br>
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,<br>
Dower&#8217;d with our curse, and stranger&#8217;d with our
oath,<br>
Take her, or leave her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, royal sir;<br>
Election makes not up on such conditions.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made
me,<br>
I tell you all her wealth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To King Of France</span></p>
<p class="speech">For you, great king,<br>
I would not from your love make such a stray,<br>
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you<br>
To avert your liking a more worthier way<br>
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed<br>
Almost to acknowledge hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">This is most strange,<br>
That she, that even but now was your best object,<br>
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,<br>
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time<br>
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle<br>
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence<br>
Must be of such unnatural degree,<br>
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch&#8217;d affection<br>
Fall&#8217;n into taint: which to believe of her,<br>
Must be a faith that reason without miracle<br>
Could never plant in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">I yet beseech your majesty,&#8212;<br>
If for I want that glib and oily art,<br>
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,<br>
I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t before I speak,&#8212;that you make known<br>
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,<br>
No unchaste action, or dishonour&#8217;d step,<br>
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;<br>
But even for want of that for which I am richer,<br>
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue<br>
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it<br>
Hath lost me in your liking.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Better thou<br>
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Is it but this,&#8212;a tardiness in nature<br>
Which often leaves the history unspoke<br>
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,<br>
What say you to the lady? Love&#8217;s not love<br>
When it is mingled with regards that stand<br>
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?<br>
She is herself a dowry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Royal Lear,<br>
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,<br>
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,<br>
Duchess of Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father<br>
That you must lose a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Peace be with Burgundy!<br>
Since that respects of fortune are his love,<br>
I shall not be his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being
poor;<br>
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!<br>
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:<br>
Be it lawful I take up what&#8217;s cast away.<br>
Gods, gods! &#8217;tis strange that from their cold&#8217;st
neglect<br>
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.<br>
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,<br>
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:<br>
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy<br>
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.<br>
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:<br>
Thou losest here, a better where to find.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for
we<br>
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see<br>
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone<br>
Without our grace, our love, our benison.<br>
Come, noble Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt all but King
Of France, Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Bid farewell to your sisters.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">The jewels of our father, with wash&#8217;d
eyes<br>
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;<br>
And like a sister am most loath to call<br>
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:<br>
To your professed bosoms I commit him<br>
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,<br>
I would prefer him to a better place.<br>
So, farewell to you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Prescribe not us our duties.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Let your study<br>
Be to content your lord, who hath received you<br>
At fortune&#8217;s alms. You have obedience scanted,<br>
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:<br>
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.<br>
Well may you prosper!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Come, my fair Cordelia.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Of France and
Cordelia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Sister, it is not a little I have to say of
what
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
father will hence to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s most certain, and with you; next
month with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">You see how full of changes his age is; the
observation we have made of it hath not been
little: he always loved our sister most; and
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
appears too grossly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath
ever
but slenderly known himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">The best and soundest of his time hath been
but
rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Such unconstant starts are we like to have
from
him as this of Kent&#8217;s banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">There is further compliment of leavetaking
between France and him. Pray you, let&#8217;s hit
together: if our father carry authority with
such dispositions as he bears, this last
surrender of his will but offend us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">We shall further think on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">We must do something, and i&#8217; the heat.</p>

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch
of
it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
not such need to hide itself. Let&#8217;s see: come,
if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
from my brother, that I have not all o&#8217;er-read;
and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
fit for your o&#8217;er-looking.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;This
policy and reverence of age makes
the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
brother, Edgar.&#8217;</p>

brought it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">It was not brought me, my lord; there&#8217;s
the
cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
and fathers declining, the father should be as
ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O villain, villain! His very opinion in the

brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
seek him; I&#8217;ll apprehend him: abominable villain!
Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I do not well know, my lord. If it shall
please
you to suspend your indignation against my
brother till you can derive from him better
testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
course; where, if you violently proceed against
him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
affection to your honour, and to no further
pretence of danger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Think you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

you

auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
that without any further delay than this very evening.</p>

<p class="speech">Nor is not, sure.</p>

<p class="speech">To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
myself, to be in a due resolution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">These late eclipses in the sun and moon
portend
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
palaces, treason; and the bond cracked &#8217;twixt son
and father. This villain of mine comes under the
prediction; there&#8217;s son against father: the king
falls from bias of nature; there&#8217;s father against
child. We have seen the best of our time:
machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
offence, honesty! &#8217;Tis strange.</p>

if we were villains by necessity; fools by
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
disposition to the charge of a star! My
father compounded with my mother under the
dragon&#8217;s tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
major; so that it follows, I am rough and
lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,

this other day, what should follow these eclipses.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I promise you, the effects he writes of
succeed
unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
maledictions against king and nobles; needless
diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, two hours together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Parted you in good terms? Found you no
displeasure in him by word or countenance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">None at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Bethink yourself wherein you may have
offended
him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
till some little time hath qualified the heat of
his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
in him, that with the mischief of your person it
would scarcely allay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>

if you do stir abroad, go armed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Armed, brother!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed:
I

and horror of it: pray you, away.</p>

Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">An you lie, sirrah, we&#8217;ll have you
whipped.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
they&#8217;ll have me whipped for speaking true, thou&#8217;lt
have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
kind o&#8217; thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o&#8217; both sides,
and left nothing i&#8217; the middle: here comes one o&#8217;
the parings.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet
on?<br>
Methinks you are too much of late i&#8217; the frown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need
to
care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
thou art nothing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your
face
bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,<br>
He that keeps nor crust nor crum,<br>
Weary of all, shall want some.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to King
Lear</span></p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a shealed peascod.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,<br>
But other of your insolent retinue<br>
Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth<br>
In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,<br>
I had thought, by making this well known unto you,<br>
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,<br>
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.<br>
That you protect this course, and put it on<br>
By your allowance; which if you should, the fault<br>
Would not &#8217;scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,<br>
Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,<br>
Might in their working do you that offence,<br>
Which else were shame, that then necessity<br>
Will call discreet proceeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">For, you trow, nuncle,<br>
The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,<br>
That it&#8217;s had it head bit off by it young.<br>
So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Are you our daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir,<br>
I would you would make use of that good wisdom,<br>
Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away<br>
These dispositions, that of late transform you<br>
From what you rightly are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">May not an ass know when the cart
draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:<br>
Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?<br>
Either his notion weakens, his discernings<br>
Are lethargied&#8212;Ha! waking? &#8217;tis not so.<br>
Who is it that can tell me who I am?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Lear&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I would learn that; for, by the
marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
I should be false persuaded I had daughters.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Which they will make an obedient father.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Your name, fair gentlewoman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">This admiration, sir, is much o&#8217; the
savour<br>
Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you<br>
To understand my purposes aright:<br>
As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.<br>
Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;<br>
Men so disorder&#8217;d, so debosh&#8217;d and bold,<br>
That this our court, infected with their manners,<br>
Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust<br>
Make it more like a tavern or a brothel<br>
Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak<br>
For instant remedy: be then desired<br>
By her, that else will take the thing she begs,<br>
A little to disquantity your train;<br>
And the remainder, that shall still depend,<br>
To be such men as may besort your age,<br>
And know themselves and you.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Darkness and devils!<br>
Saddle my horses; call my train together:<br>
Degenerate bastard! I&#8217;ll not trouble thee.<br>
Yet have I left a daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">You strike my people; and your disorder&#8217;d
rabble<br>
Make servants of their betters.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Albany</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Woe, that too late repents,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Albany</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, are you come?<br>
Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.<br>
Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,<br>
More hideous when thou show&#8217;st thee in a child<br>
Than the sea-monster!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, sir, be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Goneril]</span> Detested
kite! thou liest.<br>
My train are men of choice and rarest parts,<br>
That all particulars of duty know,<br>
And in the most exact regard support<br>
The worships of their name. O most small fault,<br>
How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!<br>
That, like an engine, wrench&#8217;d my frame of nature<br>
From the fix&#8217;d place; drew from heart all love,<br>
And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!<br>
Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Striking his head</span></p>
<p class="speech">And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant<br>
Of what hath moved you.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so, my lord.<br>
Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!<br>
Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend<br>
To make this creature fruitful!<br>
Into her womb convey sterility!<br>
Dry up in her the organs of increase;<br>
And from her derogate body never spring<br>
A babe to honour her! If she must teem,<br>
Create her child of spleen; that it may live,<br>
And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!<br>
Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;<br>
With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;<br>
Turn all her mother&#8217;s pains and benefits<br>
To laughter and contempt; that she may feel<br>
How sharper than a serpent&#8217;s tooth it is<br>
To have a thankless child! Away, away!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Never afflict yourself to know the cause;<br>
But let his disposition have that scope<br>
That dotage gives it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter King Lear</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">What, fifty of my followers at a clap!<br>
Within a fortnight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell thee:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">Life and death! I am ashamed<br>
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;<br>
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,<br>
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!<br>
The untented woundings of a father&#8217;s curse<br>
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,<br>
Beweep this cause again, I&#8217;ll pluck ye out,<br>
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,<br>
To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?<br>
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,<br>
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:<br>
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails<br>
She&#8217;ll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find<br>
That I&#8217;ll resume the shape which thou dost think<br>
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,<br>
I warrant thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Lear, Kent, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Do you mark that, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot be so partial, Goneril,<br>
To the great love I bear you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To the Fool</span></p>
<p class="speech">You, sir, more knave than fool, after your
master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the
fool
with thee.<br>
A fox, when one has caught her,<br>
And such a daughter,<br>
Should sure to the slaughter,<br>
If my cap would buy a halter:<br>
So the fool follows after.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">This man hath had good counsel:&#8212;a hundred
knights!<br>
&#8217;Tis politic and safe to let him keep<br>
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,<br>
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,<br>
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,<br>
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you may fear too far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Safer than trust too far:<br>
Let me still take away the harms I fear,<br>
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.<br>
What he hath utter&#8217;d I have writ my sister<br>
If she sustain him and his hundred knights<br>
When I have show&#8217;d the unfitness,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Oswald</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Oswald!<br>
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Take you some company, and away to horse:<br>
Inform her full of my particular fear;<br>
And thereto add such reasons of your own<br>
As may compact it more. Get you gone;<br>
And hasten your return.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Oswald</span></p>
<p class="speech">No, no, my lord,<br>
This milky gentleness and course of yours<br>
Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,<br>
You are much more attask&#8217;d for want of wisdom<br>
Than praised for harmful mildness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:<br>
Striving to better, oft we mar what&#8217;s well.</p>

Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you

If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.</p>

<p class="speech">Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>

the middle on&#8217;s face?</p>

<p class="speech">No.</p>

house.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>

his
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be
my

<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Thy asses are gone about &#8217;em. The reason
