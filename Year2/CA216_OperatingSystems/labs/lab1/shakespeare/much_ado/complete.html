<h4>Scene I. Before Leonato&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Leonato, Hero, and
Beatrice, with a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I learn in this letter that Don Peter of
Arragon
comes this night to Messina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">He is very near by this: he was not three leagues
off
when I left him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">How many gentlemen have you lost in this
action?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">But few of any sort, and none of name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">A victory is twice itself when the achiever
brings
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Much deserved on his part and equally remembered
by
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
tell you how.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very
much
glad of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I have already delivered him letters, and
there
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
not show itself modest enough without a badge of
bitterness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Did he break out into tears?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">In great measure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">A kind overflow of kindness: there are no
faces
truer than those that are so washed. How much
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from
the
wars or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I know none of that name, lady: there was none
such
in the army of any sort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">What is he that you ask for, niece?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, he&#8217;s returned; and as pleasant as ever
he was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">He set up his bills here in Messina and
challenged
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle&#8217;s fool, reading
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too
much;
but he&#8217;ll be meet with you, I doubt it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">He hath done good service, lady, in these
wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat
it:
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
excellent stomach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">And a good soldier too, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a
lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with
all
honourable virtues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed
man:
but for the stuffing,&#8212;well, we are all mortal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is
a
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
they never meet but there&#8217;s a skirmish of wit
between them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
bear it for a difference between himself and his
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Very easily possible: he wears his faith but
as
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
next block.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your
books.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I
pray
you, who is his companion? Is there no young
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">He is most in the company of the right noble
Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease:
he
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
thousand pound ere a&#8217; be cured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I will hold friends with you, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">You will never run mad, niece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, not till a hot January.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Don Pedro is approached.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don Pedro, Don John,
Claudio, Benedick, and Balthasar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet
your
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
cost, and you encounter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Never came trouble to my house in the likeness
of
your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
and happiness takes his leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">You embrace your charge too willingly. I think
this
is your daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Her mother hath many times told me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a
child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by
this
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
honourable father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">If Signior Leonato be her father, she would
not
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
like him as she is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder that you will still be talking,
Signior
Benedick: nobody marks you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet
living?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Is it possible disdain should die while she
hath
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
in her presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain
I
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
heart; for, truly, I love none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">A dear happiness to women: they would else
have
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
swear he loves me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so
some
gentleman or other shall &#8217;scape a predestinate
scratched face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Scratching could not make it worse, an
&#8217;twere such
a face as yours were.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of
yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,
and
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i&#8217; God&#8217;s
name; I have done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You always end with a jade&#8217;s trick: I know
you of old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior
Claudio
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
the least a month; and he heartily prays some
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">If you swear, my lord, you shall not be
forsworn.
<span class="stage">[To Don John]</span>
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you: I am not of many words, but I
thank
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Please it your grace lead on?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except Benedick
and Claudio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior
Leonato?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I noted her not; but I looked on her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not a modest young lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Do you question me, as an honest man should do,
for
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Why, i&#8217; faith, methinks she&#8217;s too low
for a high
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
for a great praise: only this commendation I can
afford her, that were she other than she is, she
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
do not like her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell
me
truly how thou likest her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Would you buy her, that you inquire after
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Can the world buy such a jewel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you
this
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
you, to go in the song?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever
I
looked on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I can see yet without spectacles and I see no
such
matter: there&#8217;s her cousin, an she were not
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn
the
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t come to this? In faith, hath not the
world
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
Go to, i&#8217; faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Don Pedro</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What secret hath held you here, that you
followed
not to Leonato&#8217;s?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I would your grace would constrain me to
tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I charge thee on thy allegiance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a
dumb
man; I would have you think so; but, on my
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
in love. With who? now that is your grace&#8217;s part.
Mark how short his answer is;&#8212;With Hero, Leonato&#8217;s
short daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If this were so, so were it uttered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Like the old tale, my lord: &#8216;it is not so,
nor
&#8217;twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
so.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If my passion change not shortly, God forbid
it
should be otherwise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well
worthy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I speak my thought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I
spoke mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">That I love her, I feel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">That she is worthy, I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">That I neither feel how she should be loved
nor
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the
despite
of beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And never could maintain his part but in the
force
of his will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that
she
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my
lord,
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker&#8217;s pen and hang me
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
blind Cupid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith,
thou
wilt prove a notable argument.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and
shoot
at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
the shoulder, and called Adam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Well, as time shall try: &#8216;In time the
savage bull
doth bear the yoke.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull&#8217;s horns and set
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
and in such great letters as they write &#8216;Here is
good horse to hire,&#8217; let them signify under my sign
&#8216;Here you may see Benedick the married man.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be
horn-mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver
in<br>
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I look for an earthquake too, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
Leonato&#8217;s: commend me to him and tell him I will
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
great preparation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I have almost matter enough in me for such an
embassage; and so I commit you&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had
it,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">The sixth of July: Your loving friend,
Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
you flout old ends any further, examine your
conscience: and so I leave you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, your highness now may do me good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,<br>
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn<br>
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Hath Leonato any son, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">No child but Hero; she&#8217;s his only heir.<br>
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O, my lord,<br>
When you went onward on this ended action,<br>
I look&#8217;d upon her with a soldier&#8217;s eye,<br>
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand<br>
Than to drive liking to the name of love:<br>
But now I am return&#8217;d and that war-thoughts<br>
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms<br>
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<br>
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,<br>
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wilt be like a lover presently<br>
And tire the hearer with a book of words.<br>
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,<br>
And I will break with her and with her father,<br>
And thou shalt have her. Was&#8217;t not to this end<br>
That thou began&#8217;st to twist so fine a story?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">How sweetly you do minister to love,<br>
That know love&#8217;s grief by his complexion!<br>
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,<br>
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What need the bridge much broader than the
flood?<br>
The fairest grant is the necessity.<br>
Look, what will serve is fit: &#8217;tis once, thou lovest,<br>
And I will fit thee with the remedy.<br>
I know we shall have revelling to-night:<br>
I will assume thy part in some disguise<br>
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,<br>
And in her bosom I&#8217;ll unclasp my heart<br>
And take her hearing prisoner with the force<br>
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:<br>
Then after to her father will I break;<br>
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.<br>
In practise let us put it presently.</p>

<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your
son?
hath he provided this music?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can
tell
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Are they good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">As the event stamps them: but they have a
good
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
this night in a dance: and if he found her
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
top and instantly break with you of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
question him yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it
appear
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry
you
mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don John and
Conrade</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus
out
of measure sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">There is no measure in the occasion that
breeds;
therefore the sadness is without limit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">You should hear reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">And when I have heard it, what blessing brings
it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">If not a present remedy, at least a patient
sufferance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou
art,
born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
at no man&#8217;s jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
for no man&#8217;s leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
tend on no man&#8217;s business, laugh when I am merry and
claw no man in his humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but you must not make the full show of
this
till you may do it without controlment. You have of
late stood out against your brother, and he hath
ta&#8217;en you newly into his grace; where it is
impossible you should take true root but by the
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
that you frame the season for your own harvest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose
in
his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
seek not to alter me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Can you make no use of your discontent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I make all use of it, for I use it only.<br>
Who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Borachio</span></p>
<p class="speech">What news, Borachio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">I came yonder from a great supper: the prince
your
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Will it serve for any model to build mischief
on?
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
unquietness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, it is your brother&#8217;s right hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Who? the most exquisite Claudio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Even he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">A proper squire! And who, and who? which way
looks
he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of
Leonato.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">A very forward March-chick! How came you to
this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was
smoking a
musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food
to
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">To the death, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Let us to the great supper: their cheer is
the
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
my mind! Shall we go prove what&#8217;s to be done?</p>

Beatrice, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Was not Count John here at supper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I saw him not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can
see
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">He is of a very melancholy disposition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">He were an excellent man that were made just in
the
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
like an image and says nothing, and the other too
like my lady&#8217;s eldest son, evermore tattling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Then half Signior Benedick&#8217;s tongue in
Count John&#8217;s
mouth, and half Count John&#8217;s melancholy in Signior
Benedick&#8217;s face,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and
money
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
in the world, if a&#8217; could get her good-will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee
a
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, she&#8217;s too curst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen
God&#8217;s
sending that way; for it is said, &#8216;God sends a curst
cow short horns;&#8217; but to a cow too curst he sends none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">So, by being too curst, God will send you no
horns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">You may light on a husband that hath no
beard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">What should I do with him? dress him in my
apparel
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
apes into hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Well, then, go you into hell?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, but to the gate; and there will the devil
meet
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
say &#8216;Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
heaven; here&#8217;s no place for you maids:&#8217; so deliver
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
there live we as merry as the day is long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Hero]</span> Well, niece,
I trust you will be ruled
by your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith; it is my cousin&#8217;s duty to make
curtsy
and say &#8216;Father, as it please you.&#8217; But yet for all
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
make another curtsy and say &#8216;Father, as it please
me.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted
with a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Not till God make men of some other metal
than
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
No, uncle, I&#8217;ll none: Adam&#8217;s sons are my brethren;
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Daughter, remember what I told you: if the
prince
do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you
be
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
important, tell him there is measure in every thing
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>

<p class="speech">To tell you true, I counterfeit him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">You could never do him so ill-well, unless you

the very man. Here&#8217;s his dry hand up and down: you
are he, you are he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">At a word, I am not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, do you think I do not know you by

mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there&#8217;s an
end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>

<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">No, you shall pardon me.</p>

<p class="speech">Nor will you not tell me who you are?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Not now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">That I was disdainful, and that I had my good
wit
out of the &#8216;Hundred Merry Tales:&#8217;&#8212;well this
was
Signior Benedick that said so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>

<p class="speech">Did he never make you laugh?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, what is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he is the prince&#8217;s jester: a very dull
fool;
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
none but libertines delight in him; and the
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">When I know the gentleman, I&#8217;ll tell him
what you say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Do, do: he&#8217;ll but break a comparison or two
on me;
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
strikes him into melancholy; and then there&#8217;s a
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
supper that night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>

<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">How know you he loves her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I heard him swear his affection.</p>

<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,<br>
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.<br>
&#8217;Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.<br>
Friendship is constant in all other things<br>
Save in the office and affairs of love:<br>
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;<br>
Let every eye negotiate for itself<br>
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch<br>
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.<br>
This is an accident of hourly proof,<br>
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Benedick</span></p>

<p class="speech">Yea, the same.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Come, will you go with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Whither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Even to the next willow, about your own
business,
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
about your neck, like an usurer&#8217;s chain? or under
your arm, like a lieutenant&#8217;s scarf? You must wear
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I wish him joy of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s spoken like an honest drovier:
so they
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
have served you thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, leave me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Ho! now you strike like the blind man:
&#8217;twas the
boy that stole your meat, and you&#8217;ll beat the post.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If it will not be, I&#8217;ll leave you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into
sedges.
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
know me! The prince&#8217;s fool! Ha? It may be I go
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
that puts the world into her person and so gives me
out. Well, I&#8217;ll be revenged as I may.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Don Pedro</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Now, signior, where&#8217;s the count? did you
see him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady
Fame.
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
that your grace had got the good will of this young
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">To be whipped! What&#8217;s his fault?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who,
being
overjoyed with finding a birds&#8217; nest, shows it his
companion, and he steals it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
transgression is in the stealer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been
made,
and the garland too; for the garland he might have
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds&#8217; nest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I will but teach them to sing, and restore them
to
the owner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">If their singing answer your saying, by my
faith,
you say honestly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
wronged by you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">O, she misused me past the endurance of a
block!
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
myself, that I was the prince&#8217;s jester, that I was
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
there were no living near her; she would infect to
the north star. I would not marry her, though she
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
and perturbation follows her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Look, here she comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Claudio, Beatrice,
Hero, and Leonato</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Will your grace command me any service to the
world&#8217;s end? I will go on the slightest errand now
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
Prester John&#8217;s foot, fetch you a hair off the great
Cham&#8217;s beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
rather than hold three words&#8217; conference with this
harpy. You have no employment for me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">None, but to desire your good company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">O God, sir, here&#8217;s a dish I love not: I
cannot
endure my Lady Tongue.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of<br>
Signior Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I
gave
him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">You have put him down, lady, you have put him
down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest
I
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Not sad, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">How then? sick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Neither, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry,
nor
well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
something of that jealous complexion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, lady, I think your blazon to be
true;
though, I&#8217;ll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
and his good will obtained: name the day of
marriage, and God give thee joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Count, take of me my daughter, and with her
my
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
grace say Amen to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, count, &#8217;tis your cue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I
were
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
you and dote upon the exchange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his
mouth
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps
on
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
ear that he is in her heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And so she doth, cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to
the
world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I would rather have one of your father&#8217;s
getting.
Hath your grace ne&#8217;er a brother like you? Your
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Will you have me, lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord, unless I might have another for
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Your silence most offends me, and to be merry
best
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
a merry hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then
there
was a star danced, and under that was I born.
Cousins, God give you joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Niece, will you look to those things I told you
of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace&#8217;s
pardon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s little of the melancholy element in
her, my
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
herself with laughing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of
suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">She were an excellent wife for Benedict.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week
married,
they would talk themselves mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">County Claudio, when mean you to go to
church?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till
love
have all his rites.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a
just
seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
things answer my mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you shake the head at so long a
breathing:
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
Hercules&#8217; labours; which is, to bring Signior
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
affection the one with the other. I would fain have
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
you three will but minister such assistance as I
shall give you direction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
nights&#8217; watchings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And I, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">And you too, gentle Hero?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">I will do any modest office, my lord, to help
my
cousin to a good husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband
that
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
and I will tell you my drift.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don John and
Borachio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
daughter of Leonato.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that
no
dishonesty shall appear in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Show me briefly how.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">I think I told your lordship a year since, how
much
I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
gentlewoman to Hero.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I remember.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">I can, at any unseasonable instant of the
night,
appoint her to look out at her lady&#8217;s chamber window.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">What life is in that, to be the death of this
marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you
to
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
Claudio&#8212;whose estimation do you mightily hold
up&#8212;to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">What proof shall I make of that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex
Claudio,
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
other issue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Only to despite them, I will endeavour any
thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro
and
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
prince and Claudio, as,&#8212;in love of your brother&#8217;s
honour, who hath made this match, and his friend&#8217;s
reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
semblance of a maid,&#8212;that you have discovered
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
offer them instances; which shall bear no less
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
before the intended wedding,&#8212;for in the meantime I
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
absent,&#8212;and there shall appear such seeming truth
of Hero&#8217;s disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will
put
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
thy fee is a thousand ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Be you constant in the accusation, and my
cunning
shall not shame me.</p>

<p class="speech">I do much wonder that one man, seeing how
much
another man is a fool when he dedicates his
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
such shallow follies in others, become the argument
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
I&#8217;ll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
my grace. Rich she shall be, that&#8217;s certain; wise,
or I&#8217;ll none; virtuous, or I&#8217;ll never cheapen her;
fair, or I&#8217;ll never look on her; mild, or come not
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and

of
to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
Signior Benedick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I
did
never think that lady would have loved any man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that
she
should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible? Sits the wind in that
corner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to
think
of it but that she loves him with an enraged
affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">May be she doth but counterfeit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, like enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit
of
passion came so near the life of passion as she
discovers it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what effects of passion shows she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you
heard
my daughter tell you how.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">She did, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have
I
thought her spirit had been invincible against all
assaults of affection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I would have sworn it had, my lord;
especially
against Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I should think this a gull, but that the
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
sure, hide himself in such reverence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">He hath ta&#8217;en the infection: hold it
up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Hath she made her affection known to
Benedick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No; and swears she never will: that&#8217;s her
torment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says:
&#8216;shall
I,&#8217; says she, &#8216;that have so oft encountered him
with scorn, write to him that I love him?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">This says she now when she is beginning to write
to
him; for she&#8217;ll be up twenty times a night, and
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember
a
pretty jest your daughter told us of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O, when she had writ it and was reading it over,
she
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">That.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O, she tore the letter into a thousand
halfpence;
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
to write to one that she knew would flout her; &#8216;I
measure him,&#8217; says she, &#8216;by my own spirit; for I
should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
love him, I should.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps,
sobs,
beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; &#8216;O
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
to herself: it is very true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
other, if she will not discover it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">To what end? He would make but a sport of it
and
torment the poor lady worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">An he should, it were an alms to hang him.
She&#8217;s an
excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
she is virtuous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And she is exceeding wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">In every thing but in loving Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so
tender
a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I
would
have daffed all other respects and made her half
myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
what a&#8217; will say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Were it good, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says
she
will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
accustomed crossness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">She doth well: if she should make tender of
her
love, &#8217;tis very possible he&#8217;ll scorn it; for the
man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">He is a very proper man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">He doth indeed show some sparks that are like
wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And I take him to be valiant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing
of
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
them with a most Christian-like fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">If he do fear God, a&#8217; must necessarily keep
peace:
if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
quarrel with fear and trembling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out
with
good counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s impossible: she may wear her
heart out first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Well, we will hear further of it by your
daughter:
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If he do not dote on her upon this, I will
never
trust my expectation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Let there be the same net spread for her; and
that
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
another&#8217;s dotage, and no such matter: that&#8217;s the
scene that I would see, which will be merely a
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Don Pedro, Claudio,
and Leonato</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Coming forward]</span> This
can be no trick: the
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
the love come from her; they say too that she will
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
are they that hear their detractions and can put
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; &#8217;tis a
truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; &#8217;tis
so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
no great argument of her folly, for I will be
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
because I have railed so long against marriage: but
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
she&#8217;s a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Beatrice</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to
dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I took no more pains for those thanks than you
take
pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
not have come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">You take pleasure then in the message?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, just so much as you may take upon a
knife&#8217;s
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
signior: fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! &#8216;Against my will I am sent to bid you
come in
to dinner;&#8217; there&#8217;s a double meaning in that &#8216;I
took
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
to thank me.&#8217; that&#8217;s as much as to say, Any pains
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</p>

Ursula</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;<br>
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice<br>
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:<br>
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula<br>
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse<br>
Is all of her; say that thou overheard&#8217;st us;<br>
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,<br>
Where honeysuckles, ripen&#8217;d by the sun,<br>
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,<br>
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride<br>
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,<br>
To listen our purpose. This is thy office;<br>
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll make her come, I warrant you,
presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,<br>
As we do trace this alley up and down,<br>
Our talk must only be of Benedick.<br>
When I do name him, let it be thy part<br>
To praise him more than ever man did merit:<br>
My talk to thee must be how Benedick<br>
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter<br>
Is little Cupid&#8217;s crafty arrow made,<br>
That only wounds by hearsay.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Beatrice,
behind</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now begin;<br>
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs<br>
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">The pleasant&#8217;st angling is to see the
fish<br>
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,<br>
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:<br>
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now<br>
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.<br>
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Then go we near her, that her ear lose
nothing<br>
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Approaching the
bower</span></p>
<p class="speech">No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;<br>
I know her spirits are as coy and wild<br>
As haggerds of the rock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">But are you sure<br>
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;<br>
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,<br>
To wish him wrestle with affection,<br>
And never to let Beatrice know of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman<br>
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed<br>
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">O god of love! I know he doth deserve<br>
As much as may be yielded to a man:<br>
But Nature never framed a woman&#8217;s heart<br>
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;<br>
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,<br>
Misprising what they look on, and her wit<br>
Values itself so highly that to her<br>
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,<br>
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,<br>
She is so self-endeared.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, I think so;<br>
And therefore certainly it were not good<br>
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,<br>
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,<br>
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,<br>
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;<br>
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,<br>
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<br>
If low, an agate very vilely cut;<br>
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<br>
If silent, why, a block moved with none.<br>
So turns she every man the wrong side out<br>
And never gives to truth and virtue that<br>
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">No, not to be so odd and from all fashions<br>
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:<br>
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<br>
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me<br>
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<br>
Therefore let Benedick, like cover&#8217;d fire,<br>
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:<br>
It were a better death than die with mocks,<br>
Which is as bad as die with tickling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">No; rather I will go to Benedick<br>
And counsel him to fight against his passion.<br>
And, truly, I&#8217;ll devise some honest slanders<br>
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know<br>
How much an ill word may empoison liking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.<br>
She cannot be so much without true judgment&#8212;<br>
Having so swift and excellent a wit<br>
As she is prized to have&#8212;as to refuse<br>
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">He is the only man of Italy.<br>
Always excepted my dear Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,<br>
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,<br>
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,<br>
Goes foremost in report through Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.<br>
When are you married, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:<br>
I&#8217;ll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel<br>
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s limed, I warrant you: we have caught
her, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>

And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,<br>
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:<br>
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee<br>

Benedick, and Leonato</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I do but stay till your marriage be consummate,
and
then go I toward Arragon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll bring you thither, my lord, if
you&#8217;ll
vouchsafe me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new
gloss
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid&#8217;s
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
tongue speaks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Gallants, I am not as I have been.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">So say I methinks you are sadder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I hope he be in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Hang him, truant! there&#8217;s no true drop of
blood in
him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
he wants money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I have the toothache.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Draw it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Hang it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">You must hang it first, and draw it
afterwards.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What! sigh for the toothache?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Where is but a humour or a worm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Well, every one can master a grief but he that
has
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Yet say I, he is in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it
be
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If he be not in love with some woman, there is
no
believing old signs: a&#8217; brushes his hat o&#8217;
mornings; what should that bode?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Hath any man seen him at the barber&#8217;s?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">No, but the barber&#8217;s man hath been seen
with him,
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
stuffed tennis-balls.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss
of a beard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, a&#8217; rubs himself with civet: can you
smell him
out by that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as much as to say, the sweet
youth&#8217;s in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">The greatest note of it is his melancholy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And when was he wont to wash his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I
hear
what they say of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept
into
a lute-string and now governed by stops.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him:
conclude,
conclude he is in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but I know who loves him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows
him not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite
of
all, dies for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">She shall be buried with her face upwards.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
hobby-horses must not hear.</p>

your ensuing marriage;&#8212;surely suit ill spent and
labour ill bestowed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,

<p class="speech">Even she; Leonato&#8217;s Hero, your Hero, every

<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">The word is too good to paint out her wickedness;
I
could say she were worse: think you of a worse
title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
see her chamber-window entered, even the night
before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
to change your mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">May this be so?</p>

<p class="speech">I will not think it.</p>

more, proceed accordingly.</p>

<p class="speech">If I see any thing to-night why I should not
marry
her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
wed, there will I shame her.</p>

<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Are you good men and true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, or else it were pity but they should
suffer
salvation, body and soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that were a punishment too good for them,
if
they should have any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the prince&#8217;s watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Well, give them their charge, neighbour
Dogberry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">First, who think you the most desertless man to
be
constable?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they
can
write and read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath
blessed
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Both which, master constable,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">You have: I knew it would be your answer.
Well,
for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
let that appear when there is no need of such
vanity. You are thought here to be the most
senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
to bid any man stand, in the prince&#8217;s name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">How if a&#8217; will not stand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go;
and
presently call the rest of the watch together and
thank God you are rid of a knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is
none
of the prince&#8217;s subjects.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">True, and they are to meddle with none but
the
prince&#8217;s subjects. You shall also make no noise in
the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
belongs to a watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">How if they will not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, let them alone till they are sober:
if
they make you not then the better answer, you may
say they are not the men you took them for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by
virtue
of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
why the more is for your honesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">If we know him to be a thief, shall we not
lay
hands on him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, by your office, you may; but I think
they
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">You have been always called a merciful man,
partner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much
more
a man who hath any honesty in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">If you hear a child cry in the night, you must
call
to the nurse and bid her still it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear
us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child
wake
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">This is the end of the charge:&#8212;you,
constable, are
to present the prince&#8217;s own person: if you meet the
prince in the night, you may stay him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, by&#8217;r our lady, that I think a&#8217;
cannot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Five shillings to one on&#8217;t, with any man
that knows
the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">By&#8217;r lady, I think it be so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there
be
any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
fellows&#8217; counsels and your own; and good night.
Come, neighbour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit
here
upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you
watch
about Signior Leonato&#8217;s door; for the wedding being
there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Dogberry and

<p class="speech">What Conrade!</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Peace! stir
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Conrade, I say!</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Here, man; I am at thy elbow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would
a
scab follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">I will owe thee an answer for that: and now
forward
with thy tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house,
for
it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
utter all to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Some treason,
masters: yet stand close.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore know I have earned of Don John a
thousand ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Is it possible that any villany should be so
dear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible
any
villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
price they will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest
that
the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
nothing to a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, it is apparel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, the fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, the fashion is the fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Tush! I may as well say the fool&#8217;s the
fool. But
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
is?</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I know that
Deformed; a&#8217; has been a vile
thief this seven year; a&#8217; goes up and down like a
gentleman: I remember his name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou not hear somebody?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">No; &#8217;twas the vane on the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief
this
fashion is? how giddily a&#8217; turns about all the hot
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh&#8217;s soldiers
in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel&#8217;s
priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">All this I see; and I see that the fashion
wears
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, neither: but know that I have
to-night
wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero&#8217;s gentlewoman, by the
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress&#8217;
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
night,&#8212;I tell this tale vilely:&#8212;I should first
tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">And thought they Margaret was Hero?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but
the
devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
at the temple, and there, before the whole
congregation, shame her with what he saw o&#8217;er night
and send her home again without a husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">We charge you, in the prince&#8217;s name,
stand!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Call up the right master constable. We have
here
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
ever was known in the commonwealth.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">And one Deformed is one of them: I know him;
a&#8217;
wears a lock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Masters, masters,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll be made bring Deformed forth, I
warrant you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Masters,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go
with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being
taken
up of these men&#8217;s bills.</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come,
we&#8217;ll obey you.</p>

<p class="speech">I like the new tire within excellently, if the
hair
were a thought browner; and your gown&#8217;s a most rare

gown that they praise so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">O, that exceeds, they say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, &#8217;s but a night-gown in respect
of
yours: cloth o&#8217; gold, and cuts, and laced with
silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
fashion, yours is worth ten on &#8217;t.</p>

me say, &#8216;saving your reverence, a husband:&#8217; and bad
thinking do not wrest true speaking, I&#8217;ll offend
nobody: is there any harm in &#8216;the heavier for a

<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>

Benedictus,

<p class="speaker">Hero</p>

<p class="speech">Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral
in
this Benedictus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning;
I
meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
that I think you are in love: nay, by&#8217;r lady, I am
not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
are in love or that you will be in love or that you
can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
now is he become a man: he swore he would never
marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
his meat without grudging: and how you may be
converted I know not, but methinks you look with
your eyes as other women do.</p>

you

<p class="speech">What is it, my good friends?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the

blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>

<p class="speech">Neighbours, you are tedious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">It pleases your worship to say so, but we are
the
poor duke&#8217;s officers; but truly, for mine own part,
if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
my heart to bestow it all of your worship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">All thy tediousness on me, ah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, an &#8217;twere a thousand pound more than

I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
am glad to hear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>

your
worship&#8217;s presence, ha&#8217; ta&#8217;en a couple of as
arrant
knaves as any in Messina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as
they
say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
us! it is a world to see. Well said, i&#8217; faith,
neighbour Verges: well, God&#8217;s a good man; an two men
ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
soul, i&#8217; faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men

Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br>
O, what authority and show of truth<br>

Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br>
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br>
All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br>

You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<br>
And so extenuate the &#8217;forehand sin:<br>
No, Leonato,<br>
I never tempted her with word too large;<br>
But, as a brother to his sister, show&#8217;d<br>
Bashful sincerity and comely love.</p>

You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br>
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br>

<p class="speech">Let me but move one question to your
daughter;<br>
And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br>
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br>
What kind of catechising call you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">To make you answer truly to your name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br>
With any just reproach?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that can Hero;<br>
Hero itself can blot out Hero&#8217;s virtue.<br>
What man was he talk&#8217;d with you yesternight<br>
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br>
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">I talk&#8217;d with no man at that hour, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<br>
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<br>
Myself, my brother and this grieved count<br>
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br>
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window<br>
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br>
Confess&#8217;d the vile encounters they have had<br>
A thousand times in secret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br>
Not to be spoke of;<br>
There is not chastity enough in language<br>
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br>
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br>
If half thy outward graces had been placed<br>
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br>
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br>
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br>
For thee I&#8217;ll lock up all the gates of love,<br>
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>
And never shall it more be gracious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>

me?</p>

<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you
down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let us go. These things, come thus to

Smother her spirits up.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John,

<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Dead, I think. Help, uncle!<br>
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.<br>
Death is the fairest cover for her shame<br>
That may be wish&#8217;d for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">How now, cousin Hero!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Have comfort, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou look up?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, wherefore should she not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing<br>
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<br>
The story that is printed in her blood?<br>
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:<br>
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<br>
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<br>
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,<br>
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?<br>
Chid I for that at frugal nature&#8217;s frame?<br>
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<br>
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<br>
Why had I not with charitable hand<br>
Took up a beggar&#8217;s issue at my gates,<br>
Who smirch&#8217;d thus and mired with infamy,<br>
I might have said &#8216;No part of it is mine;<br>
This shame derives itself from unknown loins&#8217;?<br>
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised<br>
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<br>
That I myself was to myself not mine,<br>
Valuing of her,&#8212;why, she, O, she is fallen<br>
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br>
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again<br>
And salt too little which may season give<br>
To her foul-tainted flesh!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sir, be patient.<br>
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,<br>
I know not what to say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly not; although, until last night,<br>
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm&#8217;d, confirm&#8217;d! O, that is
stronger made<br>
Which was before barr&#8217;d up with ribs of iron!<br>
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,<br>
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,<br>
Wash&#8217;d it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me a little;<br>
For I have only been silent so long<br>
And given way unto this course of fortune.<br>
...<br>
By noting of the lady I have mark&#8217;d<br>
A thousand blushing apparitions<br>
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames<br>
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;<br>
And in her eye there hath appear&#8217;d a fire,<br>
To burn the errors that these princes hold<br>
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<br>
Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br>
Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br>
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<br>
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<br>
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here<br>
Under some biting error.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Friar, it cannot be.<br>
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<br>
Is that she will not add to her damnation<br>
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:<br>
Why seek&#8217;st thou then to cover with excuse<br>
That which appears in proper nakedness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">They know that do accuse me; I know none:<br>
If I know more of any man alive<br>
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,<br>
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,<br>
Prove you that any man with me conversed<br>
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight<br>
Maintain&#8217;d the change of words with any creature,<br>
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">There is some strange misprision in the
princes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Two of them have the very bent of honour;<br>
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br>
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,<br>
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br>
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<br>
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br>
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br>
Nor age so eat up my invention,<br>
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br>
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br>
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<br>
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br>
Ability in means and choice of friends,<br>
To quit me of them throughly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Pause awhile,<br>
And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br>
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:<br>
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br>
And publish it that she is dead indeed;<br>
Maintain a mourning ostentation<br>
And on your family&#8217;s old monument<br>
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<br>
That appertain unto a burial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">What shall become of this? what will this do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br>
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:<br>
But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br>
But on this travail look for greater birth.<br>
She dying, as it must so be maintain&#8217;d,<br>
Upon the instant that she was accused,<br>
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused<br>
Of every hearer: for it so falls out<br>
That what we have we prize not to the worth<br>
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&#8217;d and lost,<br>
Why, then we rack the value, then we find<br>
The virtue that possession would not show us<br>
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br>
When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br>
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br>
Into his study of imagination,<br>
And every lovely organ of her life<br>
Shall come apparell&#8217;d in more precious habit,<br>
More moving-delicate and full of life,<br>
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br>
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<br>
If ever love had interest in his liver,<br>
And wish he had not so accused her,<br>
No, though he thought his accusation true.<br>
Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br>
Will fashion the event in better shape<br>
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br>
But if all aim but this be levell&#8217;d false,<br>
The supposition of the lady&#8217;s death<br>
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<br>
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<br>
As best befits her wounded reputation,<br>
In some reclusive and religious life,<br>
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:<br>
And though you know my inwardness and love<br>
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,<br>
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this<br>
As secretly and justly as your soul<br>
Should with your body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Being that I flow in grief,<br>
The smallest twine may lead me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well consented: presently away;<br>
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.<br>
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day<br>
Perhaps is but prolong&#8217;d: have patience and endure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Benedick and
Beatrice</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I will not desire that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You have no reason; I do it freely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Surely I do believe your fair cousin is
wronged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that
would right her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is there any way to show such friendship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">A very even way, but no such friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">May a man do it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">It is a man&#8217;s office, but not yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I do love nothing in the world so well as you:
is
not that strange?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">As strange as the thing I know not. It were
as
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Do not swear, and eat it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I will swear by it that you love me; and I will
make
him eat it that says I love not you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not eat your word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">With no sauce that can be devised to it. I
protest<br>
I love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, God forgive me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">What offence, sweet Beatrice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about
to
protest I loved you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And do it with all thy heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I love you with so much of my heart that none
is
left to protest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Come, bid me do any thing for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Kill Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! not for the wide world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You kill me to deny it. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, sweet Beatrice.</p>

in
you: nay, I pray you, let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>

<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I will go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll be friends first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You dare easier be friends with me than fight
with mine enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is Claudio thine enemy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Is he not approved in the height a villain,
that
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
come to take hands; and then, with public
accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
&#8212;O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
in the market-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, Beatrice,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Talk with a man out at a window! A proper
saying!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but, Beatrice,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she
is undone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Beat&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Princes and counties! Surely, a princely
testimony,
a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Use it for my love some other way than swearing
by it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath
wronged Hero?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I
will
kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.</p>

piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,

more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a

But no man&#8217;s virtue nor sufficiency<br>
To be so moral when he shall endure<br>
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:<br>
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Therein do men from children nothing differ.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and
blood;<br>
For there was never yet philosopher<br>
That could endure the toothache patiently,<br>
However they have writ the style of gods<br>
And made a push at chance and sufferance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;<br>
Make those that do offend you suffer too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">There thou speak&#8217;st reason: nay, I will do
so.<br>
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;<br>
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince<br>
And all of them that thus dishonour her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don Pedro and
Claudio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Good den, good den.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Good day to both of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Hear you. my lords,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">We have some haste, Leonato.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my
lord:<br>
Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">If he could right himself with quarreling,<br>
Some of us would lie low.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Who wrongs him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler,
thou:&#8212;<br>
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;<br>
I fear thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Marry, beshrew my hand,<br>
If it should give your age such cause of fear:<br>
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:<br>
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,<br>
As under privilege of age to brag<br>
What I have done being young, or what would do<br>
Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<br>
Thou hast so wrong&#8217;d mine innocent child and me<br>
That I am forced to lay my reverence by<br>
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,<br>
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<br>
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;<br>
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<br>
And she lies buried with her ancestors;<br>
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,<br>
Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">My villany?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">You say not right, old man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, my lord,<br>
I&#8217;ll prove it on his body, if he dare,<br>
Despite his nice fence and his active practise,<br>
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Away! I will not have to do with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill&#8217;d my
child:<br>
If thou kill&#8217;st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:<br>
But that&#8217;s no matter; let him kill one first;<br>
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.<br>
Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:<br>
Sir boy, I&#8217;ll whip you from your foining fence;<br>
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Brother,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;<br>
And she is dead, slander&#8217;d to death by villains,<br>
That dare as well answer a man indeed<br>
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:<br>
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Brother Antony,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Hold you content. What, man! I know them,
yea,<br>
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,&#8212;<br>
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,<br>
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<br>
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,<br>
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,<br>
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;<br>
And this is all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">But, brother Antony,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, &#8217;tis no matter:<br>
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen both, we will not wake your
patience.<br>
My heart is sorry for your daughter&#8217;s death:<br>
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing<br>
But what was true and very full of proof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I will not hear you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And shall, or some of us will smart for it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Leonato and
Antonio</span></p>

<p class="speech">See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Benedick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, signior, what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Good day, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
almost a fray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">We had like to have had our two noses snapped
off
with two old men without teeth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou?
Had
we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I
came
to seek you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">We have been up and down to seek thee; for we
are
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Never any did so, though very many have been
beside
their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art
thou
sick, or angry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">What, courage, man! What though care killed a
cat,
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and
you
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then, give him another staff: this last
was
broke cross.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">By this light, he changes more and more: I
think
he be angry indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I speak a word in your ear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">God bless me from a challenge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Claudio]</span> You
are a villain; I jest not:
I will make it good how you dare, with what you
dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
hear from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I will meet you, so I may have good
cheer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What, a feast, a feast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a
calf&#8217;s
head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
curiously, say my knife&#8217;s naught. Shall I not find
a woodcock too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit
the
other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: &#8216;True,&#8217;
said she, &#8216;a fine little one.&#8217; &#8216;No,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;a
great wit:&#8217; &#8216;Right,&#8217; says she, &#8216;a great
gross one.&#8217;
&#8216;Nay,&#8217; said I, &#8216;a good wit:&#8217;
&#8216;Just,&#8217; said she, &#8216;it
hurts nobody.&#8217; &#8216;Nay,&#8217; said I, &#8216;the
gentleman
is wise:&#8217; &#8216;Certain,&#8217; said she, &#8216;a wise
gentleman.&#8217;
&#8216;Nay,&#8217; said I, &#8216;he hath the tongues:&#8217;
&#8216;That I
believe,&#8217; said she, &#8216;for he swore a thing to me on
Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
there&#8217;s a double tongue; there&#8217;s two tongues.&#8217;
Thus
did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
wast the properest man in Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">For the which she wept heartily and said she
cared
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if
she
did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
the old man&#8217;s daughter told us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he
was
hid in the garden.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">But when shall we set the savage bull&#8217;s
horns on
the sensible Benedick&#8217;s head?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and text underneath, &#8216;Here dwells
Benedick the
married man&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will
leave
you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
then, peace be with him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">He is in earnest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">In most profound earnest; and, I&#8217;ll warrant
you, for
the love of Beatrice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">And hath challenged thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Most sincerely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What a pretty thing man is when he goes in
his
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dogberry, Verges, and
the Watch, with Conrade and Borachio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you,
she
shall ne&#8217;er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">How now? two of my brother&#8217;s men bound!
Borachio
one!</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Hearken after their offence, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Officers, what offence have these men done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly,
I
ask thee what&#8217;s their offence; sixth and lastly, why
they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
to their charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and,
by
my troth, there&#8217;s one meaning well suited.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Who have you offended, masters, that you are
thus
bound to your answer? this learned constable is
too cunning to be understood: what&#8217;s your offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine
answer:
do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero&#8217;s
garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
master&#8217;s false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
nothing but the reward of a villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Runs not this speech like iron through your
blood?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I have drunk poison whiles he utter&#8217;d
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">But did my brother set thee on to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">He is composed and framed of treachery:<br>
And fled he is upon this villany.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear<br>
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time
our
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
and place shall serve, that I am an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and
the<br>
Sexton too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Leonato and Antonio,

<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,<br>
That, when I note another man like him,<br>
I may avoid him: which of these is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">If you would know your wronger, look on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast
kill&#8217;d<br>
Mine innocent child?</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, even I alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:<br>
Here stand a pair of honourable men;<br>
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.<br>
I thank you, princes, for my daughter&#8217;s death:<br>
Record it with your high and worthy deeds:<br>
&#8217;Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I know not how to pray your patience;<br>
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;<br>
Impose me to what penance your invention<br>
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn&#8217;d I not<br>
But in mistaking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By my soul, nor I:<br>
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,<br>
I would bend under any heavy weight<br>
That he&#8217;ll enjoin me to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;<br>
That were impossible: but, I pray you both,<br>
Possess the people in Messina here<br>
How innocent she died; and if your love<br>
Can labour ought in sad invention,<br>
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb<br>
And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:<br>
To-morrow morning come you to my house,<br>
And since you could not be my son-in-law,<br>
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,<br>
Almost the copy of my child that&#8217;s dead,<br>
And she alone is heir to both of us:<br>
Give her the right you should have given her cousin,<br>
And so dies my revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O noble sir,<br>
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!<br>
I do embrace your offer; and dispose<br>
For henceforth of poor Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow then I will expect your coming;<br>
To-night I take my leave. This naughty man<br>
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,<br>
Who I believe was pack&#8217;d in all this wrong,<br>
Hired to it by your brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my soul, she was not,<br>
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,<br>
But always hath been just and virtuous<br>
In any thing that I do know by her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white
and
black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God&#8217;s
name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
for God&#8217;s sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.</p>

<p class="speech">&#8216;Then&#8217; is spoken; fare you well now:
and yet, ere
I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is
but
foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
will depart unkissed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast frighted the word out of his right
sense,
so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">For them all together; which maintained so
politic
a state of evil that they will not admit any good
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
good parts did you first suffer love for me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
indeed, for I love thee against my will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor
heart!
If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">It appears not in this confession: there&#8217;s
not one
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived
in
the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
widow weeps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">And how long is that, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter
in
rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Very ill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And how do you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Very ill too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Serve God, love me and mend. There will I
leave
you too, for here comes one in haste.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ursula</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ursula</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, you must come to your uncle.
Yonder&#8217;s old
coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
fed and gone. Will you come presently?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Will you go hear this news, signior?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and
be
buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
thee to thy uncle&#8217;s.</p>

<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Did I not tell you she was innocent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">So are the prince and Claudio, who accused
her<br>
Upon the error that you heard debated:<br>
But Margaret was in some fault for this,<br>
Although against her will, as it appears<br>
In the true course of all the question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And so am I, being else by faith enforced<br>

<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,<br>
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,<br>
And when I send for you, come hither mask&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speech">The prince and Claudio promised by this hour<br>
To visit me. You know your office, brother:<br>
You must be father to your brother&#8217;s daughter<br>

<p class="speech">Which I will do with confirm&#8217;d
countenance.</p>

<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">To do what, signior?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">To bind me, or undo me; one of them.<br>
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,<br>
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">That eye my daughter lent her: &#8217;tis most
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And I do with an eye of love requite her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">The sight whereof I think you had from me,<br>
From Claudio and the prince: but what&#8217;s your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:<br>
But, for my will, my will is your good will<br>
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin&#8217;d<br>
In the state of honourable marriage:<br>
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>

<p class="speech">Good morrow to this fair assembly.</p>

We here attend you. Are you yet determined<br>
To-day to marry with my brother&#8217;s daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Call her forth, brother; here&#8217;s the friar
ready.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what&#8217;s the
matter,<br>
That you have such a February face,<br>
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I think he thinks upon the savage bull.<br>
Tush, fear not, man; we&#8217;ll tip thy horns with gold<br>
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,<br>
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,<br>
When he would play the noble beast in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;<br>
And some such strange bull leap&#8217;d your father&#8217;s
cow,<br>
And got a calf in that same noble feat<br>
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">For this I owe you: here comes other
reckonings.</p>

Ladies masked</span></p>
<p class="speech">Which is the lady I must seize upon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">This same is she, and I do give you her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then she&#8217;s mine. Sweet, let me see
your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">No, that you shall not, till you take her
hand<br>
Before this friar and swear to marry her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand: before this holy friar,<br>
I am your husband, if you like of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">And when I lived, I was your other wife:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Unmasking</span></p>
<p class="speech">And when you loved, you were my other
husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Another Hero!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nothing certainer:<br>
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,<br>
And surely as I live, I am a maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">The former Hero! Hero that is dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">She died, my lord, but whiles her slander
lived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">All this amazement can I qualify:<br>
When after that the holy rites are ended,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you largely of fair Hero&#8217;s death:<br>
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,<br>
And to the chapel let us presently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Unmasking]</span> I answer
to that name. What is your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Do not you love me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no; no more than reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then your uncle and the prince and
Claudio<br>
Have been deceived; they swore you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Do not you love me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Troth, no; no more than reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula<br>
Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">They swore that you were almost sick for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">They swore that you were well-nigh dead for
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis no such matter. Then you do not love
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly, but in friendly recompense.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Come, cousin, I am sure you love the
gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll be sworn upon&#8217;t that he
loves her;<br>
For here&#8217;s a paper written in his hand,<br>
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,<br>
Fashion&#8217;d to Beatrice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">And here&#8217;s another<br>
Writ in my cousin&#8217;s hand, stolen from her pocket,<br>
Containing her affection unto Benedick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">A miracle! here&#8217;s our own hands against our
hearts.
Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
thee for pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I
yield
upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
for I was told you were in a consumption.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! I will stop your mouth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell thee what, prince; a college
of
wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
if a man will be beaten with brains, a&#8217; shall wear
nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
purpose that the world can say against it; and
therefore never flout at me for what I have said
against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied
Beatrice,
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
exceedingly narrowly to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, we are friends: let&#8217;s have a
dance ere
we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
and our wives&#8217; heels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll have dancing afterward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">First, of my word; therefore play, music.
Prince,
thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.</p>
