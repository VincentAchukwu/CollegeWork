<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, with drum and colours,
Edmund, Regan, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,<br>
Or whether since he is advised by aught<br>
To change the course: he&#8217;s full of alteration<br>
And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To a Gentleman, who goes
out</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Our sister&#8217;s man is certainly
miscarried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis to be doubted, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sweet lord,<br>
You know the goodness I intend upon you:<br>
Tell me&#8212;but truly&#8212;but then speak the truth,<br>
Do you not love my sister?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">In honour&#8217;d love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">But have you never found my brother&#8217;s
way<br>
To the forfended place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">That thought abuses you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I am doubtful that you have been conjunct<br>
And bosom&#8217;d with her, as far as we call hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">No, by mine honour, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I never shall endure her: dear my lord,<br>
Be not familiar with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Fear me not:<br>
She and the duke her husband!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, with drum and colours,
Albany, Goneril, and Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I had rather
lose the battle than that sister<br>
Should loosen him and me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Our very loving sister, well be-met.<br>
Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,<br>
With others whom the rigor of our state<br>
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,<br>
I never yet was valiant: for this business,<br>
It toucheth us, as France invades our land,<br>
Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,<br>
Most just and heavy causes make oppose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you speak nobly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Why is this reason&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Combine together &#8217;gainst the enemy;<br>
For these domestic and particular broils<br>
Are not the question here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s then determine<br>
With the ancient of war on our proceedings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I shall attend you presently at your tent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Sister, you&#8217;ll go with us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis most convenient; pray you, go with
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O, ho, I know
the riddle.&#8212;I will go.</p>

Edgar disguised</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">If e&#8217;er your grace had speech with man so
poor,<br>
Hear me one word.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Albany and
Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.<br>
If you have victory, let the trumpet sound<br>
For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,<br>
I can produce a champion that will prove<br>
What is avouched there. If you miscarry,<br>
Your business of the world hath so an end,<br>
And machination ceases. Fortune love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Stay till I have read the letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">I was forbid it.<br>
When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,<br>
And I&#8217;ll appear again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Why, fare thee well: I will o&#8217;erlook thy
paper.</p>

<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">The enemy&#8217;s in view; draw up your
powers.<br>
Here is the guess of their true strength and forces<br>
By diligent discovery; but your haste<br>
Is now urged on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">We will greet the time.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">To both these sisters have I sworn my love;<br>
Each jealous of the other, as the stung<br>
Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?<br>
Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
If both remain alive: to take the widow<br>
Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;<br>
And hardly shall I carry out my side,<br>
Her husband being alive. Now then we&#8217;ll use<br>
His countenance for the battle; which being done,<br>
Let her who would be rid of him devise<br>
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy<br>
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,<br>
The battle done, and they within our power,<br>
Shall never see his pardon; for my state<br>
Stands on me to defend, not to debate.</p>

Who, with best meaning, have incurr&#8217;d the worst.<br>
For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;<br>
Myself could else out-frown false fortune&#8217;s frown.<br>
Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, no, no! Come, let&#8217;s away to
prison:<br>
We two alone will sing like birds i&#8217; the cage:<br>
When thou dost ask me blessing, I&#8217;ll kneel down,<br>
And ask of thee forgiveness: so we&#8217;ll live,<br>
And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh<br>
At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues<br>
Talk of court news; and we&#8217;ll talk with them too,<br>
Who loses and who wins; who&#8217;s in, who&#8217;s out;<br>
And take upon&#8217;s the mystery of things,<br>
As if we were God&#8217;s spies: and we&#8217;ll wear out,<br>
In a wall&#8217;d prison, packs and sects of great ones,<br>
That ebb and flow by the moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?<br>
He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,<br>
And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;<br>
The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,<br>
Ere they shall make us weep: we&#8217;ll see &#8217;em starve
first. Come.</p>

One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost<br>
As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way<br>
To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men<br>
Are as the time is: to be tender-minded<br>
Does not become a sword: thy great employment<br>
Will not bear question; either say thou&#8217;lt do &#8217;t,<br>

<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant
strain,<br>
And fortune led you well: you have the captives<br>
That were the opposites of this day&#8217;s strife:<br>
We do require them of you, so to use them<br>
As we shall find their merits and our safety<br>
May equally determine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I thought it fit<br>
To send the old and miserable king<br>
To some retention and appointed guard;<br>
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,<br>
To pluck the common bosom on his side,<br>
An turn our impress&#8217;d lances in our eyes<br>
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;<br>
My reason all the same; and they are ready<br>
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear<br>
Where you shall hold your session. At this time<br>
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;<br>
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed<br>
By those that feel their sharpness:<br>
The question of Cordelia and her father<br>
Requires a fitter place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, by your patience,<br>
I hold you but a subject of this war,<br>
Not as a brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That&#8217;s as we list to grace
him.<br>
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,<br>
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;<br>
Bore the commission of my place and person;<br>
The which immediacy may well stand up,<br>
And call itself your brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Not so hot:<br>
In his own grace he doth exalt himself,<br>
More than in your addition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">In my rights,<br>
By me invested, he compeers the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">That were the most, if he should husband you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Jesters do oft prove prophets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Holla, holla!<br>
That eye that told you so look&#8217;d but a-squint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, I am not well; else I should answer<br>
From a full-flowing stomach. General,<br>
Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;<br>
Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:<br>
Witness the world, that I create thee here<br>
My lord and master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Mean you to enjoy him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">The let-alone lies not in your good will.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Edmund]</span> Let the
drum strike, and prove my title thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>

On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,<br>
This gilded serpent</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to
Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">For your claim, fair sister,<br>
I bar it in the interest of my wife:<br>
&#8217;Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,<br>
And I, her husband, contradict your bans.<br>
If you will marry, make your loves to me,<br>
My lady is bespoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>

<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art arm&#8217;d, Gloucester: let the trumpet

Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,<br>
There is my pledge;</p>

Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,<br>

My truth and honour firmly.</p>

Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.<br>
Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,<br>
My oath, and my profession: I protest,<br>
Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,<br>
Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,<br>
Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;<br>
False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;<br>
Conspirant &#8217;gainst this high-illustrious prince;<br>
And, from the extremest upward of thy head<br>
To the descent and dust below thy foot,<br>
A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou &#8216;No,&#8217;<br>
This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent<br>
To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,<br>
Thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">In wisdom I should ask thy name;<br>
But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,<br>
And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,<br>

By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:<br>
Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;<br>
With the hell-hated lie o&#8217;erwhelm thy heart;<br>

My name is Edgar, and thy father&#8217;s son.<br>
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices<br>
Make instruments to plague us:<br>
The dark and vicious place where thee he got<br>
Cost him his eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>

true;<br>
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Methought thy very gait did prophesy<br>
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:<br>
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I<br>
Did hate thee or thy father!</p>

<p class="speech">Worthy prince, I know&#8217;t.</p>

How have you known the miseries of your father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;<br>
And when &#8217;tis told, O, that my heart would burst!<br>
The bloody proclamation to escape,<br>
That follow&#8217;d me so near,&#8212;O, our lives&#8217;
sweetness!<br>
That we the pain of death would hourly die<br>
Rather than die at once!&#8212;taught me to shift<br>
Into a madman&#8217;s rags; to assume a semblance<br>
That very dogs disdain&#8217;d: and in this habit<br>
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,<br>
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,<br>
Led him, begg&#8217;d for him, saved him from despair;<br>
Never,&#8212;O fault!&#8212;reveal&#8217;d myself unto him,<br>
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm&#8217;d:<br>
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,<br>
I ask&#8217;d his blessing, and from first to last<br>
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw&#8217;d heart,<br>
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!<br>
&#8217;Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,<br>
Burst smilingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">This speech of yours hath moved me,<br>
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;<br>
You look as you had something more to say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;<br>
For I am almost ready to dissolve,<br>
Hearing of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;This would have seem&#8217;d a
period<br>
To such as love not sorrow; but another,<br>
To amplify too much, would make much more,<br>
And top extremity.<br>
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,<br>
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,<br>
Shunn&#8217;d my abhorr&#8217;d society; but then, finding<br>
Who &#8217;twas that so endured, with his strong arms<br>
He fastened on my neck, and bellow&#8217;d out<br>
As he&#8217;ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;<br>
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him<br>
That ever ear received: which in recounting<br>
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life<br>
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,<br>
And there I left him tranced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">But who was this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Kent, sir, the banish&#8217;d Kent; who in
disguise<br>
Follow&#8217;d his enemy king, and did him service<br>
Improper for a slave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Gentleman, with a
bloody knife</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Help, help, O, help!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">What kind of help?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">What means that bloody knife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis hot, it smokes;<br>
It came even from the heart of&#8212;O, she&#8217;s dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Who dead? speak, man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister<br>
By her is poisoned; she hath confess&#8217;d it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I was contracted to them both: all three<br>
Now marry in an instant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Kent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:<br>
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,<br>
Touches us not with pity.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Kent</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, is this he?<br>
The time will not allow the compliment<br>
Which very manners urges.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I am come<br>
To bid my king and master aye good night:<br>
Is he not here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Great thing of us forgot!<br>
Speak, Edmund, where&#8217;s the king? and where&#8217;s
Cordelia?<br>
See&#8217;st thou this object, Kent?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The bodies of Goneril and
Regan are brought in</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, why thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yet Edmund was beloved:<br>
The one the other poison&#8217;d for my sake,<br>
And after slew herself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Even so. Cover their faces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I pant for life: some good I mean to do,<br>
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,<br>
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ<br>
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:<br>
Nay, send in time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Run, run, O, run!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send<br>
Thy token of reprieve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Well thought on: take my sword,<br>
Give it the captain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Haste thee, for thy life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">He hath commission from thy wife and me<br>
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and<br>
To lay the blame upon her own despair,<br>
That she fordid herself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Edmund is borne
off</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter King Lear, with
Cordelia dead in his arms; Edgar, Captain, and others
following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of
stones:<br>
Had I your tongues and eyes, I&#8217;ld use them so<br>
That heaven&#8217;s vault should crack. She&#8217;s gone for
ever!<br>
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;<br>
She&#8217;s dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;<br>
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,<br>
Why, then she lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the promised end</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Or image of that horror?</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Fall, and cease!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,<br>
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows<br>
That ever I have felt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> O my good
master!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis noble Kent, your friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!<br>
I might have saved her; now she&#8217;s gone for ever!<br>
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!<br>
What is&#8217;t thou say&#8217;st? Her voice was ever soft,<br>
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.<br>
I kill&#8217;d the slave that was a-hanging thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, my lords, he did.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Did I not, fellow?<br>
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion<br>
I would have made them skip: I am old now,<br>
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?<br>
Mine eyes are not o&#8217; the best: I&#8217;ll tell you
straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,<br>
One of them we behold.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">The same,<br>
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a good fellow, I can tell you
that;<br>
He&#8217;ll strike, and quickly too: he&#8217;s dead and
rotten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; I am the very man,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see that straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">That, from your first of difference and
decay,<br>
Have follow&#8217;d your sad steps.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You are welcome hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Nor no man else: all&#8217;s cheerless, dark, and
deadly.<br>
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,<br>
And desperately are dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">He knows not what he says: and vain it is<br>
That we present us to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Very bootless.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Captain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Edmund is dead, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s but a trifle here.<br>
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.<br>
What comfort to this great decay may come<br>
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,<br>
During the life of this old majesty,<br>
To him our absolute power:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Edgar and Kent</span></p>
<p class="speech">you, to your rights:<br>
With boot, and such addition as your honours<br>
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste<br>
The wages of their virtue, and all foes<br>
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">And my poor fool is hang&#8217;d! No, no, no
life!<br>
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,<br>
And thou no breath at all? Thou&#8217;lt come no more,<br>
Never, never, never, never, never!<br>
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.<br>
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,<br>
Look there, look there!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">He faints! My lord, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Break, heart; I prithee, break!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Look up, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him
much<br>
That would upon the rack of this tough world<br>
Stretch him out longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">He is gone, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">The wonder is, he hath endured so long:<br>
He but usurp&#8217;d his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Bear them from hence. Our present business<br>
Is general woe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Kent and Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speech">Friends of my soul, you twain<br>
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;<br>
My master calls me, I must not say no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">The weight of this sad time we must obey;<br>
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.<br>
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young<br>
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt, with a dead
march</span></p>
