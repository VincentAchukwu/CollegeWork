4.1)
It does not generate regular language since the left hand side also consists of 
terminals. Regular languages must have non-terminals on the left side, and either 
a terminal on the right side or a terminal followed by a single non-terminal.

4.2)
It is not context free since the left side has terminal and non-terminal.
Context free must have non-terminal on the left, and terminal + non-terminal on the 
right side

4.3)
It is context sensitive as the rule states in type 1 grammars:
Alpha, some non-terminal, and Beta yields alpha, psi, and Beta,
where psi is not empty, but alpha and Beta can be empty. Context sensitive grammars 
are also non-shrinking.
