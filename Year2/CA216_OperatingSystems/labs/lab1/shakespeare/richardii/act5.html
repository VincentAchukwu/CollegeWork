<h4>Scene I. London. A street leading to the Tower.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen and
Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">This way the king will come; this is the way<br>
To Julius Caesar&#8217;s ill-erected tower,<br>
To whose flint bosom my condemned lord<br>
Is doom&#8217;d a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:<br>
Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth<br>
Have any resting for her true king&#8217;s queen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard II and
Guard</span></p>
<p class="speech">But soft, but see, or rather do not see,<br>
My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,<br>
That you in pity may dissolve to dew,<br>
And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.<br>
Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,<br>
Thou map of honour, thou King Richard&#8217;s tomb,<br>
And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,<br>
Why should hard-favour&#8217;d grief be lodged in thee,<br>
When triumph is become an alehouse guest?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,<br>
To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,<br>
To think our former state a happy dream;<br>
From which awaked, the truth of what we are<br>
Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,<br>
To grim Necessity, and he and I<br>
Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France<br>
And cloister thee in some religious house:<br>
Our holy lives must win a new world&#8217;s crown,<br>
Which our profane hours here have stricken down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">What, is my Richard both in shape and mind<br>
Transform&#8217;d and weaken&#8217;d? hath Bolingbroke deposed<br>
Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?<br>
The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,<br>
And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage<br>
To be o&#8217;erpower&#8217;d; and wilt thou, pupil-like,<br>
Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,<br>
And fawn on rage with base humility,<br>
Which art a lion and a king of beasts?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but
beasts,<br>
I had been still a happy king of men.<br>
Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:<br>
Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,<br>
As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.<br>
In winter&#8217;s tedious nights sit by the fire<br>
With good old folks and let them tell thee tales<br>
Of woeful ages long ago betid;<br>
And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,<br>
Tell thou the lamentable tale of me<br>
And send the hearers weeping to their beds:<br>
For why, the senseless brands will sympathize<br>
The heavy accent of thy moving tongue<br>
And in compassion weep the fire out;<br>
And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,<br>
For the deposing of a rightful king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Northumberland and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:<br>
You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.<br>
And, madam, there is order ta&#8217;en for you;<br>
With all swift speed you must away to France.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal<br>
The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,<br>
The time shall not be many hours of age<br>
More than it is ere foul sin gathering head<br>
Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,<br>
Though he divide the realm and give thee half,<br>
It is too little, helping him to all;<br>
And he shall think that thou, which know&#8217;st the way<br>
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,<br>
Being ne&#8217;er so little urged, another way<br>
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.<br>
The love of wicked men converts to fear;<br>
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both<br>
To worthy danger and deserved death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My guilt be on my head, and there an end.<br>
Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate<br>
A twofold marriage, &#8217;twixt my crown and me,<br>
And then betwixt me and my married wife.<br>
Let me unkiss the oath &#8217;twixt thee and me;<br>
And yet not so, for with a kiss &#8217;twas made.<br>
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,<br>
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;<br>
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,<br>
She came adorned hither like sweet May,<br>
Sent back like Hallowmas or short&#8217;st of day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">And must we be divided? must we part?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from
heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Banish us both and send the king with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">That were some love but little policy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Then whither he goes, thither let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">So two, together weeping, make one woe.<br>
Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;<br>
Better far off than near, be ne&#8217;er the near.<br>
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">So longest way shall have the longest moans.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Twice for one step I&#8217;ll groan, the way
being short,<br>
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.<br>
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let&#8217;s be brief,<br>
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;<br>
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;<br>
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Give me mine own again; &#8217;twere no good
part<br>
To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.<br>
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,<br>
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We make woe wanton with this fond delay:<br>
Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. The Duke Of York&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of York and
Duchess Of York</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,<br>
When weeping made you break the story off,<br>
Of our two cousins coming into London.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Where did I leave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At that sad stop, my lord,<br>
Where rude misgovern&#8217;d hands from windows&#8217; tops<br>
Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,<br>
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed<br>
Which his aspiring rider seem&#8217;d to know,<br>
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,<br>
Whilst all tongues cried &#8216;God save thee,<br>
Bolingbroke!&#8217;<br>
You would have thought the very windows spake,<br>
So many greedy looks of young and old<br>
Through casements darted their desiring eyes<br>
Upon his visage, and that all the walls<br>
With painted imagery had said at once<br>
&#8216;Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!&#8217;<br>
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,<br>
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed&#8217;s neck,<br>
Bespake them thus: &#8216;I thank you, countrymen:&#8217;<br>
And thus still doing, thus he pass&#8217;d along.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the
whilst?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,<br>
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,<br>
Are idly bent on him that enters next,<br>
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;<br>
Even so, or with much more contempt, men&#8217;s eyes<br>
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried &#8216;God save
him!&#8217;<br>
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:<br>
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:<br>
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,<br>
His face still combating with tears and smiles,<br>
The badges of his grief and patience,<br>
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel&#8217;d<br>
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted<br>
And barbarism itself have pitied him.<br>
But heaven hath a hand in these events,<br>
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.<br>
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,<br>
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes my son Aumerle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Aumerle that was;<br>
But that is lost for being Richard&#8217;s friend,<br>
And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:<br>
I am in parliament pledge for his truth<br>
And lasting fealty to the new-made king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of
Aumerle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my son: who are the violets now<br>
That strew the green lap of the new come spring?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:<br>
God knows I had as lief be none as one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Well, bear you well in this new spring of
time,<br>
Lest you be cropp&#8217;d before you come to prime.<br>
What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">For aught I know, my lord, they do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">You will be there, I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">If God prevent not, I purpose so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">What seal is that, that hangs without thy
bosom?<br>
Yea, look&#8217;st thou pale? let me see the writing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, &#8217;tis nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">No matter, then, who see it;<br>
I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech your grace to pardon me:<br>
It is a matter of small consequence,<br>
Which for some reasons I would not have seen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.<br>
I fear, I fear,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What should you fear?<br>
&#8217;Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter&#8217;d into<br>
For gay apparel &#8217;gainst the triumph day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond<br>
That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.<br>
Boy, let me see the writing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He plucks it out of his bosom
and reads it</span></p>
<p class="speech">Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor!
slave!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Ho! who is within there?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Saddle my horse.<br>
God for his mercy, what treachery is here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what is it, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.<br>
Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,<br>
I will appeach the villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, foolish woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I will not peace. What is the matter,
Aumerle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Good mother, be content; it is no more<br>
Than my poor life must answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Thy life answer!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Servant with
boots</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art
amazed.<br>
Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Give me my boots, I say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Why, York, what wilt thou do?<br>
Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?<br>
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?<br>
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?<br>
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,<br>
And rob me of a happy mother&#8217;s name?<br>
Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Thou fond mad woman,<br>
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?<br>
A dozen of them here have ta&#8217;en the sacrament,<br>
And interchangeably set down their hands,<br>
To kill the king at Oxford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">He shall be none;<br>
We&#8217;ll keep him here: then what is that to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my
son,<br>
I would appeach him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou groan&#8217;d for him<br>
As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.<br>
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect<br>
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,<br>
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:<br>
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:<br>
He is as like thee as a man may be,<br>
Not like to me, or any of my kin,<br>
And yet I love him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Make way, unruly woman!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;<br>
Spur post, and get before him to the king,<br>
And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.<br>
I&#8217;ll not be long behind; though I be old,<br>
I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:<br>
And never will I rise up from the ground<br>
Till Bolingbroke have pardon&#8217;d thee. Away, be gone!</p>

If any plague hang over us, &#8217;tis he.<br>
I would to God, my lords, he might be found:<br>
Inquire at London, &#8217;mongst the taverns there,<br>
For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,<br>
With unrestrained loose companions,<br>
Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,<br>
And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;<br>
Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,<br>
Takes on the point of honour to support<br>
So dissolute a crew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>

He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.</p>

<p class="speech">Unto my mother&#8217;s prayers I bend my
knee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Against them both my true joints bended be.<br>
Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;<br>
His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;<br>
His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:<br>
He prays but faintly and would be denied;<br>
We pray with heart and soul and all beside:<br>
His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;<br>
Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:<br>
His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;<br>
Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.<br>
Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have<br>
That mercy which true prayer ought to have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Good aunt, stand up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not say, &#8216;stand up;&#8217;<br>
Say, &#8216;pardon&#8217; first, and afterwards &#8216;stand
up.&#8217;<br>
And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,<br>
&#8216;Pardon&#8217; should be the first word of thy speech.<br>
I never long&#8217;d to hear a word till now;<br>
Say &#8216;pardon,&#8217; king; let pity teach thee how:<br>
The word is short, but not so short as sweet;<br>
No word like &#8216;pardon&#8217; for kings&#8217; mouths so
meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Speak it in French, king; say, &#8216;pardonne
moi.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?<br>
Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,<br>
That set&#8217;st the word itself against the word!<br>
Speak &#8216;pardon&#8217; as &#8217;tis current in our land;<br>
The chopping French we do not understand.<br>
Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;<br>
Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;<br>
That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,<br>
Pity may move thee &#8216;pardon&#8217; to rehearse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Good aunt, stand up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I do not sue to stand;<br>
Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!<br>
Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;<br>
Twice saying &#8216;pardon&#8217; doth not pardon twain,<br>
But makes one pardon strong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart<br>
I pardon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A god on earth thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">But for our trusty brother-in-law and the
abbot,<br>
With all the rest of that consorted crew,<br>
Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.<br>
Good uncle, help to order several powers<br>
To Oxford, or where&#8217;er these traitors are:<br>
They shall not live within this world, I swear,<br>
But I will have them, if I once know where.<br>
Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:<br>
Your mother well hath pray&#8217;d, and prove you true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.</p>

That would divorce this terror from my heart;&#8217;<br>

<h4>Scene V. Pomfret castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">I have been studying how I may compare<br>
This prison where I live unto the world:<br>
And for because the world is populous<br>
And here is not a creature but myself,<br>
I cannot do it; yet I&#8217;ll hammer it out.<br>
My brain I&#8217;ll prove the female to my soul,<br>
My soul the father; and these two beget<br>
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,<br>
And these same thoughts people this little world,<br>
In humours like the people of this world,<br>
For no thought is contented. The better sort,<br>
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&#8217;d<br>
With scruples and do set the word itself<br>
Against the word:<br>
As thus, &#8216;Come, little ones,&#8217; and then again,<br>
&#8216;It is as hard to come as for a camel<br>
To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8217;<br>
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot<br>
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails<br>
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs<br>
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,<br>
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.<br>
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves<br>
That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,<br>
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars<br>
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,<br>
That many have and others must sit there;<br>
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,<br>
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back<br>
Of such as have before endured the like.<br>
Thus play I in one person many people,<br>
And none contented: sometimes am I king;<br>
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,<br>
And so I am: then crushing penury<br>
Persuades me I was better when a king;<br>
Then am I king&#8217;d again: and by and by<br>
Think that I am unking&#8217;d by Bolingbroke,<br>
And straight am nothing: but whate&#8217;er I be,<br>
Nor I nor any man that but man is<br>
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased<br>
With being nothing. Music do I hear?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,<br>
When time is broke and no proportion kept!<br>
So is it in the music of men&#8217;s lives.<br>
And here have I the daintiness of ear<br>
To cheque time broke in a disorder&#8217;d string;<br>
But for the concord of my state and time<br>
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.<br>
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;<br>
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:<br>
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar<br>
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,<br>
Whereto my finger, like a dial&#8217;s point,<br>
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<br>
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is<br>
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,<br>
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans<br>
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time<br>
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke&#8217;s proud joy,<br>
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o&#8217; the clock.<br>
This music mads me; let it sound no more;<br>
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,<br>
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.<br>
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!<br>
For &#8217;tis a sign of love; and love to Richard<br>
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</p>

Stable</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, royal prince!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, noble peer;<br>
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.<br>
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,<br>
Where no man never comes but that sad dog<br>
That brings me food to make misfortune live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,<br>
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,<br>
With much ado at length have gotten leave<br>
To look upon my sometimes royal master&#8217;s face.<br>
O, how it yearn&#8217;d my heart when I beheld<br>
In London streets, that coronation-day,<br>
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,<br>
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,<br>
That horse that I so carefully have dress&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,<br>
How went he under him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">So proudly as if he disdain&#8217;d the
ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!<br>
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;<br>
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.<br>
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,<br>
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck<br>
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?<br>
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,<br>
Since thou, created to be awed by man,<br>
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;<br>
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,<br>
Spurr&#8217;d, gall&#8217;d and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately came from the king, commands the contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!<br>
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</p>

armed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what means death in this rude
assault?<br>
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death&#8217;s instrument.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Snatching an axe from a
Servant and killing him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go thou, and fill another room in hell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He kills another. Then Exton
strikes him down</span></p>
<p class="speech">That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire<br>
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand<br>
Hath with the king&#8217;s blood stain&#8217;d the king&#8217;s own
land.<br>
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;<br>
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exton</p>
<p class="speech">As full of valour as of royal blood:<br>
Both have I spill&#8217;d; O would the deed were good!<br>
For now the devil, that told me I did well,<br>
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.<br>
This dead king to the living king I&#8217;ll bear<br>
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</p>

Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;<br>

The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:<br>
The manner of their taking may appear<br>
At large discoursed in this paper here.</p>

Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,<br>
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;<br>
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:<br>
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,<br>
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.</p>

Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies<br>
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,<br>
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>

wrought<br>
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand<br>
Upon my head and all this famous land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exton</p>
<p class="speech">From your own mouth, my lord, did I this
deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">They love not poison that do poison need,<br>
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,<br>
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.<br>
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,<br>
But neither my good word nor princely favour:<br>
With Cain go wander through shades of night,<br>
And never show thy head by day nor light.<br>
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,<br>
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:<br>
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,<br>
And put on sullen black incontinent:<br>
I&#8217;ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,<br>
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:<br>
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;<br>
In weeping after this untimely bier.</p>
