<h4>Scene I. Rome. Before the Palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Now climbeth Tamora Olympus&#8217; top,<br>
Safe out of fortune&#8217;s shot; and sits aloft,<br>
Secure of thunder&#8217;s crack or lightning flash;<br>
Advanced above pale envy&#8217;s threatening reach.<br>
As when the golden sun salutes the morn,<br>
And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,<br>
Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,<br>
And overlooks the highest-peering hills;<br>
So Tamora:<br>
Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,<br>
And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.<br>
Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,<br>
To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,<br>
And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long<br>
Hast prisoner held, fetter&#8217;d in amorous chains<br>
And faster bound to Aaron&#8217;s charming eyes<br>
Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.<br>
Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!<br>
I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,<br>
To wait upon this new-made empress.<br>
To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,<br>
This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,<br>
This siren, that will charm Rome&#8217;s Saturnine,<br>
And see his shipwreck and his commonweal&#8217;s.<br>
Holloa! what storm is this?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Demetrius and Chiron,
braving</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants
edge,<br>
And manners, to intrude where I am graced;<br>
And may, for aught thou know&#8217;st, affected be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;<br>
And so in this, to bear me down with braves.<br>
&#8217;Tis not the difference of a year or two<br>
Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:<br>
I am as able and as fit as thou<br>
To serve, and to deserve my mistress&#8217; grace;<br>
And that my sword upon thee shall approve,<br>
And plead my passions for Lavinia&#8217;s love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Clubs, clubs!
these lovers will not keep
the peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,<br>
Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,<br>
Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?<br>
Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath<br>
Till you know better how to handle it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,<br>
Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They draw</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Coming forward]</span> Why,
how now, lords!<br>
So near the emperor&#8217;s palace dare you draw,<br>
And maintain such a quarrel openly?<br>
Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:<br>
I would not for a million of gold<br>
The cause were known to them it most concerns;<br>
Nor would your noble mother for much more<br>
Be so dishonour&#8217;d in the court of Rome.<br>
For shame, put up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not I, till I have sheathed<br>
My rapier in his bosom and withal<br>
Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat<br>
That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">For that I am prepared and full resolved.<br>
Foul-spoken coward, that thunder&#8217;st with thy tongue,<br>
And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Away, I say!<br>
Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,<br>
This petty brabble will undo us all.<br>
Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous<br>
It is to jet upon a prince&#8217;s right?<br>
What, is Lavinia then become so loose,<br>
Or Bassianus so degenerate,<br>
That for her love such quarrels may be broach&#8217;d<br>
Without controlment, justice, or revenge?<br>
Young lords, beware! and should the empress know<br>
This discord&#8217;s ground, the music would not please.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">I care not, I, knew she and all the world:<br>
I love Lavinia more than all the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner
choice:<br>
Lavinia is thine elder brother&#8217;s hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome<br>
How furious and impatient they be,<br>
And cannot brook competitors in love?<br>
I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths<br>
By this device.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Aaron, a thousand deaths<br>
Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">To achieve her! how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Why makest thou it so strange?<br>
She is a woman, therefore may be woo&#8217;d;<br>
She is a woman, therefore may be won;<br>
She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.<br>
What, man! more water glideth by the mill<br>
Than wots the miller of; and easy it is<br>
Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:<br>
Though Bassianus be the emperor&#8217;s brother.<br>
Better than he have worn Vulcan&#8217;s badge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Ay, and as
good as Saturninus may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Then why should he despair that knows to court
it<br>
With words, fair looks and liberality?<br>
What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,<br>
And borne her cleanly by the keeper&#8217;s nose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or
so<br>
Would serve your turns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so the turn were served.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Aaron, thou hast hit it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Would you had hit it too!<br>
Then should not we be tired with this ado.<br>
Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools<br>
To square for this? would it offend you, then<br>
That both should speed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, not me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nor me, so I were one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">For shame, be friends, and join for that you
jar:<br>
&#8217;Tis policy and stratagem must do<br>
That you affect; and so must you resolve,<br>
That what you cannot as you would achieve,<br>
You must perforce accomplish as you may.<br>
Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste<br>
Than this Lavinia, Bassianus&#8217; love.<br>
A speedier course than lingering languishment<br>
Must we pursue, and I have found the path.<br>
My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;<br>
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:<br>
The forest walks are wide and spacious;<br>
And many unfrequented plots there are<br>
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:<br>
Single you thither then this dainty doe,<br>
And strike her home by force, if not by words:<br>
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.<br>
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit<br>
To villany and vengeance consecrate,<br>
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;<br>
And she shall file our engines with advice,<br>
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,<br>
But to your wishes&#8217; height advance you both.<br>
The emperor&#8217;s court is like the house of Fame,<br>
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:<br>
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;<br>
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
your turns;<br>
There serve your lusts, shadow&#8217;d from heaven&#8217;s eye,<br>
And revel in Lavinia&#8217;s treasury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream<br>
To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.<br>
Per Styga, per manes vehor.</p>

heard.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus Andronicus, with
Hunters, &amp; c., Marcus, Lucius, Quintus, and Martius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,<br>
The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:<br>
Uncouple here and let us make a bay<br>
And wake the emperor and his lovely bride<br>
And rouse the prince and ring a hunter&#8217;s peal,<br>
That all the court may echo with the noise.<br>
Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,<br>
To attend the emperor&#8217;s person carefully:<br>
I have been troubled in my sleep this night,<br>
But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A cry of hounds and horns,
winded in a peal. Enter Saturninus, Tamora, Bassianus, Lavinia,
Demetrius, Chiron, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">Many good morrows to your majesty;<br>
Madam, to you as many and as good:<br>
I promised your grace a hunter&#8217;s peal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">And you have rung it lustily, my lord;<br>
Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Lavinia, how say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">I say, no;<br>
I have been broad awake two hours and more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, then; horse and chariots let us
have,<br>
And to our sport.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Tamora</span></p>
<p class="speech">Madam, now shall ye see<br>
Our Roman hunting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I have dogs, my lord,<br>
Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,<br>
And climb the highest promontory top.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">And I have horse will follow where the game<br>
Makes way, and run like swallows o&#8217;er the plain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>

hound,<br>
But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aaron, with a bag of
gold</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">He that had wit would think that I had none,<br>
To bury so much gold under a tree,<br>
And never after to inherit it.<br>
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly<br>
Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,<br>
Which, cunningly effected, will beget<br>
A very excellent piece of villany:<br>
And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest</p>

<p class="speech">That have their alms out of the empress&#8217;

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tamora</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">My lovely Aaron, wherefore look&#8217;st thou
sad,<br>
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?<br>
The birds chant melody on every bush,<br>
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,<br>
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind<br>
And make a chequer&#8217;d shadow on the ground:<br>
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,<br>
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,<br>
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,<br>
As if a double hunt were heard at once,<br>
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;<br>
And, after conflict such as was supposed<br>
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
When with a happy storm they were surprised<br>
And curtain&#8217;d with a counsel-keeping cave,<br>
We may, each wreathed in the other&#8217;s arms,<br>
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;<br>
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds<br>
Be unto us as is a nurse&#8217;s song<br>
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, though Venus govern your desires,<br>
Saturn is dominator over mine:<br>
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,<br>
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,<br>
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls<br>
Even as an adder when she doth unroll<br>
To do some fatal execution?<br>
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:<br>
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,<br>
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.<br>
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,<br>
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,<br>
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:<br>
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,<br>
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity<br>
And wash their hands in Bassianus&#8217; blood.<br>
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,<br>
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.<br>
Now question me no more; we are espied;<br>
Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,<br>
Which dreads not yet their lives&#8217; destruction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:<br>
Be cross with him; and I&#8217;ll go fetch thy sons<br>
To back thy quarrels, whatsoe&#8217;er they be.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bassianus and
Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Who have we here? Rome&#8217;s royal empress,<br>
Unfurnish&#8217;d of her well-beseeming troop?<br>
Or is it Dian, habited like her,<br>
Who hath abandoned her holy groves<br>
To see the general hunting in this forest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Saucy controller of our private steps!<br>
Had I the power that some say Dian had,<br>
Thy temples should be planted presently<br>
With horns, as was Actaeon&#8217;s; and the hounds<br>
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,<br>
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">Under your patience, gentle empress,<br>
&#8217;Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;<br>
And to be doubted that your Moor and you<br>
Are singled forth to try experiments:<br>
Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!<br>
&#8217;Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian<br>
Doth make your honour of his body&#8217;s hue,<br>
Spotted, detested, and abominable.<br>
Why are you sequester&#8217;d from all your train,<br>
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.<br>
And wander&#8217;d hither to an obscure plot,<br>
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,<br>
If foul desire had not conducted you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">And, being intercepted in your sport,<br>
Great reason that my noble lord be rated<br>
For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,<br>
And let her joy her raven-colour&#8217;d love;<br>
This valley fits the purpose passing well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">The king my brother shall have note of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:<br>
Good king, to be so mightily abused!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Why have I patience to endure all this?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Demetrius and
Chiron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious
mother!<br>
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?<br>
These two have &#8217;ticed me hither to this place:<br>
A barren detested vale, you see it is;<br>
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,<br>
O&#8217;ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:<br>
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,<br>
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:<br>
And when they show&#8217;d me this abhorred pit,<br>
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,<br>
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,<br>
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,<br>
Would make such fearful and confused cries<br>
As any mortal body hearing it<br>
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.<br>
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,<br>
But straight they told me they would bind me here<br>
Unto the body of a dismal yew,<br>
And leave me to this miserable death:<br>
And then they call&#8217;d me foul adulteress,<br>
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms<br>
That ever ear did hear to such effect:<br>
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,<br>
This vengeance on me had they executed.<br>
Revenge it, as you love your mother&#8217;s life,<br>
Or be ye not henceforth call&#8217;d my children.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">This is a witness that I am thy son.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabs Bassianus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">And this for me, struck home to show my
strength.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Also stabs Bassianus, who
dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,<br>
For no name fits thy nature but thy own!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys<br>
Your mother&#8217;s hand shall right your mother&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;<br>
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:<br>
This minion stood upon her chastity,<br>
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,<br>
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:<br>
And shall she carry this unto her grave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.<br>
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,<br>
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">But when ye have the honey ye desire,<br>
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that
sure.<br>
Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy<br>
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">O Tamora! thou bear&#8217;st a woman&#8217;s
face,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">I will not hear her speak; away with her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory<br>
To see her tears; but be your heart to them<br>
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">When did the tiger&#8217;s young ones teach the
dam?<br>
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;<br>
The milk thou suck&#8217;dst from her did turn to marble;<br>
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.<br>
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Chiron</span></p>
<p class="speech">Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a
bastard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a
lark:<br>
Yet have I heard,&#8212;O, could I find it now!&#8212;<br>
The lion moved with pity did endure<br>
To have his princely paws pared all away:<br>
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,<br>
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:<br>
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,<br>
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what it means; away with her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me teach thee! for my father&#8217;s
sake,<br>
That gave thee life, when well he might have
slain thee,<br>
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou in person ne&#8217;er offended me,<br>
Even for his sake am I pitiless.<br>
Remember, boys, I pour&#8217;d forth tears in vain,<br>
To save your brother from the sacrifice;<br>
But fierce Andronicus would not relent;<br>
Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,<br>
The worse to her, the better loved of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">O Tamora, be call&#8217;d a gentle queen,<br>
And with thine own hands kill me in this place!<br>
For &#8217;tis not life that I have begg&#8217;d so long;<br>
Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">What begg&#8217;st thou, then? fond woman, let me
go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis present death I beg; and one thing
more<br>
That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:<br>
O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,<br>
And tumble me into some loathsome pit,<br>
Where never man&#8217;s eye may behold my body:<br>
Do this, and be a charitable murderer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:<br>
No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Away! for thou hast stay&#8217;d us here too
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!<br>
The blot and enemy to our general name!<br>
Confusion fall&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then I&#8217;ll stop your mouth. Bring thou
her husband:<br>
This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Demetrius throws the body of
Bassianus into the pit; then exeunt Demetrius and Chiron, dragging
off Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my sons: see that you make her
sure.<br>
Ne&#8217;er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,<br>
Till all the Andronici be made away.<br>
Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,<br>
And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow&#8217;r.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Aaron, with Quintus
and Martius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, my lords, the better foot before:<br>
Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit<br>
Where I espied the panther fast asleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">My sight is very dull, whate&#8217;er it
bodes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">And mine, I promise you; were&#8217;t not for
shame,<br>
Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Falls into the pit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">What art thou fall&#8217;n? What subtle hole is
this,<br>
Whose mouth is cover&#8217;d with rude-growing briers,<br>
Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood<br>
As fresh as morning dew distill&#8217;d on flowers?<br>
A very fatal place it seems to me.<br>
Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">O brother, with the dismall&#8217;st object
hurt<br>
That ever eye with sight made heart lament!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Now will I
fetch the king to find them here,<br>
That he thereby may give a likely guess<br>
How these were they that made away his brother.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost not comfort me, and help me out<br>
From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">I am surprised with an uncouth fear;<br>
A chilling sweat o&#8217;er-runs my trembling joints:<br>
My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,<br>
Aaron and thou look down into this den,<br>
And see a fearful sight of blood and death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart<br>
Will not permit mine eyes once to behold<br>
The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;<br>
O, tell me how it is; for ne&#8217;er till now<br>
Was I a child to fear I know not what.</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,<br>
All on a heap, like to a slaughter&#8217;d lamb,<br>
In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">If it be dark, how dost thou know &#8217;tis
he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">Upon his bloody finger he doth wear<br>
A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,<br>
Which, like a taper in some monument,<br>
Doth shine upon the dead man&#8217;s earthy cheeks,<br>
And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:<br>
So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus<br>
When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.<br>
O brother, help me with thy fainting hand&#8212;<br>
If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath&#8212;<br>
Out of this fell devouring receptacle,<br>
As hateful as Cocytus&#8217; misty mouth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;<br>
Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,<br>
I may be pluck&#8217;d into the swallowing womb<br>
Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus&#8217; grave.<br>
I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quintus</p>
<p class="speech">Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,<br>
Till thou art here aloft, or I below:<br>
Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Falls in</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Saturninus with
Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Along with me: I&#8217;ll see what hole is
here,<br>
And what he is that now is leap&#8217;d into it.<br>
Say who art thou that lately didst descend<br>
Into this gaping hollow of the earth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">The unhappy son of old Andronicus:<br>
Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,<br>
To find thy brother Bassianus dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:<br>
He and his lady both are at the lodge<br>
Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;<br>
&#8217;Tis not an hour since I left him there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Martius</p>
<p class="speech">We know not where you left him all alive;<br>
But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Tamora, with
Attendants; Titus Andronicus, and Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Where is my lord the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing
grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy brother Bassianus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:<br>
Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,<br>
The complot of this timeless tragedy;<br>
And wonder greatly that man&#8217;s face can fold<br>
In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She giveth Saturninus a
letter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;An if
we miss to meet him handsomely&#8212;<br>
Sweet huntsman, Bassianus &#8217;tis we mean&#8212;<br>
Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:<br>
Thou know&#8217;st our meaning. Look for thy reward<br>
Among the nettles at the elder-tree<br>
Which overshades the mouth of that same pit<br>
Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.<br>
Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.&#8217;<br>
O Tamora! was ever heard the like?<br>
This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.<br>
Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out<br>
That should have murdered Bassianus here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Titus]</span> Two of thy
whelps, fell curs of
bloody kind,<br>
Have here bereft my brother of his life.<br>
Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:<br>
There let them bide until we have devised<br>
Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!<br>
How easily murder is discovered!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">High emperor, upon my feeble knee<br>
I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,<br>
That this fell fault of my accursed sons,<br>
Accursed if the fault be proved in them,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">If it be proved! you see it is apparent.<br>
Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Andronicus himself did take it up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;<br>
For, by my father&#8217;s reverend tomb, I vow<br>
They shall be ready at your highness&#8217; will<br>
To answer their suspicion with their lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.<br>
Some bring the murder&#8217;d body, some the murderers:<br>
Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;<br>
For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,<br>
That end upon them should be executed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Andronicus, I will entreat the king;<br>
Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>

them.</p>

<p class="speech">Who is this? my niece, that flies away so
fast!<br>
Cousin, a word; where is your husband?<br>
If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!<br>
If I do wake, some planet strike me down,<br>
That I may slumber in eternal sleep!<br>
Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands<br>
Have lopp&#8217;d and hew&#8217;d and made thy body bare<br>
Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,<br>
Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,<br>
And might not gain so great a happiness<br>
As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?<br>
Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,<br>
Like to a bubbling fountain stirr&#8217;d with wind,<br>
Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,<br>
Coming and going with thy honey breath.<br>
But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,<br>
And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.<br>
Ah, now thou turn&#8217;st away thy face for shame!<br>
And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,<br>
As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,<br>
Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan&#8217;s face<br>
Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.<br>
Shall I speak for thee? shall I say &#8217;tis so?<br>
O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,<br>
That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!<br>
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp&#8217;d,<br>
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.<br>
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,<br>
And in a tedious sampler sew&#8217;d her mind:<br>
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;<br>
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,<br>
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,<br>
That could have better sew&#8217;d than Philomel.<br>
O, had the monster seen those lily hands<br>
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,<br>
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,<br>
He would not then have touch&#8217;d them for his life!<br>
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony<br>
Which that sweet tongue hath made,<br>
He would have dropp&#8217;d his knife, and fell asleep<br>
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet&#8217;s feet.<br>
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;<br>
For such a sight will blind a father&#8217;s eye:<br>
One hour&#8217;s storm will drown the fragrant meads;<br>
What will whole months of tears thy father&#8217;s eyes?<br>
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee<br>
O, could our mourning ease thy misery!</p>
