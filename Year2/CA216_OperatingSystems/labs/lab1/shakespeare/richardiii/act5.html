<h4>Scene I. Salisbury. An open place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Sheriff, and
Buckingham, with halberds, led to execution</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Will not King Richard let me speak with him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; therefore be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Hastings, and Edward&#8217;s children, Rivers,
Grey,<br>
Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,<br>
Vaughan, and all that have miscarried<br>
By underhand corrupted foul injustice,<br>
If that your moody discontented souls<br>
Do through the clouds behold this present hour,<br>
Even for revenge mock my destruction!<br>
This is All-Souls&#8217; day, fellows, is it not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">It is, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then All-Souls&#8217; day is my body&#8217;s
doomsday.<br>
This is the day that, in King Edward&#8217;s time,<br>
I wish&#8217;t might fall on me, when I was found<br>
False to his children or his wife&#8217;s allies<br>
This is the day wherein I wish&#8217;d to fall<br>
By the false faith of him I trusted most;<br>
This, this All-Souls&#8217; day to my fearful soul<br>
Is the determined respite of my wrongs:<br>
That high All-Seer that I dallied with<br>
Hath turn&#8217;d my feigned prayer on my head<br>
And given in earnest what I begg&#8217;d in jest.<br>
Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men<br>
To turn their own points on their masters&#8217; bosoms:<br>
Now Margaret&#8217;s curse is fallen upon my head;<br>
&#8216;When he,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;shall split thy heart with
sorrow,<br>
Remember Margaret was a prophetess.&#8217;<br>
Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;<br>
Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.</p>

Blunt, Herbert, and others, with drum and colours</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,<br>
Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,<br>
Thus far into the bowels of the land<br>
Have we march&#8217;d on without impediment;<br>
And here receive we from our father Stanley<br>
Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.<br>
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,<br>
That spoil&#8217;d your summer fields and fruitful vines,<br>
Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough<br>
In your embowell&#8217;d bosoms, this foul swine<br>
Lies now even in the centre of this isle,<br>
Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn<br>
From Tamworth thither is but one day&#8217;s march.<br>
In God&#8217;s name, cheerly on, courageous friends,<br>
To reap the harvest of perpetual peace<br>
By this one bloody trial of sharp war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Every man&#8217;s conscience is a thousand
swords,<br>
To fight against that bloody homicide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Herbert</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">He hath no friends but who are friends for
fear.<br>
Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">All for our vantage. Then, in God&#8217;s name,
march:<br>
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow&#8217;s wings:<br>
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.</p>

field.<br>
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>

not?</p>

tonight;<br>
But where to-morrow? Well, all&#8217;s one for that.<br>
Who hath descried the number of the foe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Why, our battalion trebles that account:<br>
Besides, the king&#8217;s name is a tower of strength,<br>
Which they upon the adverse party want.<br>
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,<br>
Let us survey the vantage of the field<br>
Call for some men of sound direction<br>
Let&#8217;s want no discipline, make no delay,<br>
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.</p>

of the Soldiers pitch Richmond&#8217;s tent</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">The weary sun hath made a golden set,<br>
And by the bright track of his fiery car,<br>
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.<br>
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.<br>
Give me some ink and paper in my tent<br>
I&#8217;ll draw the form and model of our battle,<br>
Limit each leader to his several charge,<br>
And part in just proportion our small strength.<br>
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,<br>
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.<br>
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:<br>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him<br>
And by the second hour in the morning<br>
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:<br>
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go&#8217;st,<br>
Where is Lord Stanley quarter&#8217;d, dost thou know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">Unless I have mista&#8217;en his colours
much,<br>
Which well I am assured I have not done,<br>
His regiment lies half a mile at least<br>
South from the mighty power of the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">If without peril it be possible,<br>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,<br>
And give him from me this most needful scroll.</p>
<p class="speaker">Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my life, my lord, I&#8217;ll under-take
it;<br>
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!</p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come
gentlemen,<br>
Let us consult upon to-morrow&#8217;s business<br>
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will not sup to-night.<br>
Give me some ink and paper.<br>
What, is my beaver easier than it was?<br>
And all my armour laid into my tent?</p>

Before sunrising, lest his son George fall<br>
Into the blind cave of eternal night.</p>

<p class="speech">Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.<br>
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.<br>
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.<br>
Ratcliff!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Saw&#8217;st thou the melancholy Lord
Northumberland?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,<br>
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop<br>
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:<br>
I have not that alacrity of spirit,<br>
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.<br>
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">It is, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Bid my guard watch; leave me.<br>
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent<br>

Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!<br>
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother<br>
Who prays continually for Richmond&#8217;s good:<br>
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,<br>
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<br>
In brief,&#8212;for so the season bids us be,&#8212;<br>
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,<br>
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement<br>
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.<br>
I, as I may&#8212;that which I would I cannot,&#8212;<br>
With best advantage will deceive the time,<br>
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:<br>
But on thy side I may not be too forward<br>
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,<br>
Be executed in his father&#8217;s sight.<br>
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time<br>
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love<br>
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,<br>
Which so long sunder&#8217;d friends should dwell upon:<br>
God give us leisure for these rites of love!<br>
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!</p>
<p class="speaker">Richmond</p>
<p class="speech">Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:<br>
I&#8217;ll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,<br>
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,<br>
When I should mount with wings of victory:<br>
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.</p>

Richmond</span></p>

Make us thy ministers of chastisement,<br>

Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.<br>
What do I fear? myself? there&#8217;s none else by:<br>
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.<br>
Is there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am:<br>
Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why:<br>
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?<br>
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore? for any good<br>
That I myself have done unto myself?<br>
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself<br>
For hateful deeds committed by myself!<br>
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.<br>
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.<br>
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,<br>
And every tongue brings in a several tale,<br>
And every tale condemns me for a villain.<br>
Perjury, perjury, in the high&#8217;st degree<br>
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;<br>
All several sins, all used in each degree,<br>
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!<br>
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;<br>
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:<br>
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself<br>
Find in myself no pity to myself?<br>

I promise you, my soul is very jocund<br>

The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,<br>
Like high-rear&#8217;d bulwarks, stand before our faces;<br>
Richard except, those whom we fight against<br>
Had rather have us win than him they follow:<br>
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,<br>
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;<br>
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish&#8217;d;<br>
One that made means to come by what he hath,<br>
And slaughter&#8217;d those that were the means to help him;<br>
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil<br>
Of England&#8217;s chair, where he is falsely set;<br>
One that hath ever been God&#8217;s enemy:<br>
Then, if you fight against God&#8217;s enemy,<br>
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;<br>
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,<br>
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;<br>
If you do fight against your country&#8217;s foes,<br>
Your country&#8217;s fat shall pay your pains the hire;<br>
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,<br>
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;<br>
If you do free your children from the sword,<br>
Your children&#8217;s children quit it in your age.<br>
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,<br>
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.<br>
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt<br>
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&#8217;s cold face;<br>
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt<br>
The least of you shall share his part thereof.<br>
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;<br>
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!</p>

Richmond?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">That he was never trained up in arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">He smiled and said &#8216;The better for our

Who saw the sun to-day?</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then he disdains to shine; for by the book<br>
He should have braved the east an hour ago<br>
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">The sun will not be seen to-day;<br>
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.<br>
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.<br>
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me<br>
More than to Richmond? for the selfsame heaven<br>
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.</p>

Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:<br>
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,<br>
And thus my battle shall be ordered:<br>
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,<br>
Consisting equally of horse and foot;<br>
Our archers shall be placed in the midst<br>
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,<br>
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.<br>
They thus directed, we will follow<br>
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side<br>
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.<br>
This, and Saint George to boot! What think&#8217;st thou,
Norfolk?</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">A good direction, warlike sovereign.<br>
This found I on my tent this morning.</p>

&#8216;Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,<br>
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.&#8217;<br>
A thing devised by the enemy.<br>
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge<br>
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:<br>
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,<br>
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:<br>
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.<br>
March on, join bravely, let us to&#8217;t pell-mell<br>
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">His oration to his
Army</span></p>
<p class="speech">What shall I say more than I have
inferr&#8217;d?<br>
Remember whom you are to cope withal;<br>
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,<br>
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,<br>
Whom their o&#8217;er-cloyed country vomits forth<br>
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.<br>
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;<br>
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,<br>
They would restrain the one, distain the other.<br>
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,<br>
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother&#8217;s cost?<br>
A milk-sop, one that never in his life<br>
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?<br>
Let&#8217;s whip these stragglers o&#8217;er the seas again;<br>
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,<br>
These famish&#8217;d beggars, weary of their lives;<br>
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,<br>
For want of means, poor rats, had hang&#8217;d themselves:<br>
If we be conquer&#8217;d, let men conquer us,<br>
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers<br>
Have in their own land beaten, bobb&#8217;d, and thump&#8217;d,<br>
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.<br>
Shall these enjoy our lands? lie with our wives?<br>
Ravish our daughters?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum afar off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark! I hear their drum.<br>
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!<br>
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!<br>
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;<br>
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech">What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his
power?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, he doth deny to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Off with his son George&#8217;s head!</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the enemy is past the marsh<br>
After the battle let George Stanley die.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:<br>
Advance our standards, set upon our foes<br>
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,<br>
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!<br>
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.</p>

And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.<br>

With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!<br>
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,<br>
That would reduce these bloody days again,<br>
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!<br>
Let them not live to taste this land&#8217;s increase<br>
That would with treason wound this fair land&#8217;s peace!<br>
