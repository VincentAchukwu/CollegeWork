<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">You come most carefully upon your hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,
Francisco.</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">For this relief much thanks: &#8217;tis bitter
cold,<br>
And I am sick at heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Have you had quiet guard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Not a mouse stirring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, good night.<br>
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,<br>
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.</p>

there?</p>

<p class="speech">Friends to this ground.</p>

<p class="speech">Holla! Bernardo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Say,<br>
What, is Horatio there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">What, has this thing appear&#8217;d again
to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">I have seen nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Horatio says &#8217;tis but our fantasy,<br>
And will not let belief take hold of him<br>
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>
Therefore I have entreated him along<br>
With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>
That if again this apparition come,<br>
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, tush, &#8217;twill not appear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Sit down awhile;<br>
And let us once again assail your ears,<br>
That are so fortified against our story<br>
What we have two nights seen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sit we down,<br>
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Last night of all,<br>
When yond same star that&#8217;s westward from the pole<br>
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven<br>
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,<br>
The bell then beating one,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes
again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">In the same figure, like the king that&#8217;s
dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Most like: it harrows me with fear and
wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">It would be spoke to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Question it, Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What art thou that usurp&#8217;st this time of
night,<br>
Together with that fair and warlike form<br>
In which the majesty of buried Denmark<br>
Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">It is offended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;See, it stalks away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis gone, and will not answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:<br>
Is not this something more than fantasy?<br>
What think you on&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Before my God, I might not this believe<br>
Without the sensible and true avouch<br>
Of mine own eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Is it not like the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">As thou art to thyself:<br>
Such was the very armour he had on<br>
When he the ambitious Norway combated;<br>
So frown&#8217;d he once, when, in an angry parle,<br>
He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.<br>
&#8217;Tis strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Thus twice before, and jump at this dead
hour,<br>
With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">In what particular thought to work I know
not;<br>
But in the gross and scope of my opinion,<br>
This bodes some strange eruption to our state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that
knows,<br>
Why this same strict and most observant watch<br>
So nightly toils the subject of the land,<br>
And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,<br>
And foreign mart for implements of war;<br>
Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task<br>
Does not divide the Sunday from the week;<br>
What might be toward, that this sweaty haste<br>
Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:<br>
Who is&#8217;t that can inform me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">That can I;<br>
At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,<br>
Whose image even but now appear&#8217;d to us,<br>
Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,<br>
Thereto prick&#8217;d on by a most emulate pride,<br>
Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet&#8212;<br>
For so this side of our known world esteem&#8217;d him&#8212;<br>
Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal&#8217;d compact,<br>
Well ratified by law and heraldry,<br>
Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands<br>
Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:<br>
Against the which, a moiety competent<br>
Was gaged by our king; which had return&#8217;d<br>
To the inheritance of Fortinbras,<br>
Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,<br>
And carriage of the article design&#8217;d,<br>
His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,<br>
Of unimproved mettle hot and full,<br>
Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there<br>
Shark&#8217;d up a list of lawless resolutes,<br>
For food and diet, to some enterprise<br>
That hath a stomach in&#8217;t; which is no other&#8212;<br>
As it doth well appear unto our state&#8212;<br>
But to recover of us, by strong hand<br>
And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands<br>
So by his father lost: and this, I take it,<br>
Is the main motive of our preparations,<br>
The source of this our watch and the chief head<br>
Of this post-haste and romage in the land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">I think it be no other but e&#8217;en so:<br>
Well may it sort that this portentous figure<br>
Comes armed through our watch; so like the king<br>
That was and is the question of these wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A mote it is to trouble the mind&#8217;s eye.<br>
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,<br>
A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,<br>
The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead<br>
Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:<br>
As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,<br>
Disasters in the sun; and the moist star<br>
Upon whose influence Neptune&#8217;s empire stands<br>
Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:<br>
And even the like precurse of fierce events,<br>
As harbingers preceding still the fates<br>
And prologue to the omen coming on,<br>
Have heaven and earth together demonstrated<br>
Unto our climatures and countrymen.&#8212;<br>
But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll cross it, though it blast me. Stay,
illusion!<br>
If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,<br>
Speak to me:<br>
If there be any good thing to be done,<br>
That may to thee do ease and grace to me,<br>
Speak to me:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cock crows</span></p>
<p class="speech">If thou art privy to thy country&#8217;s
fate,<br>
Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!<br>
Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life<br>
Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,<br>
For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,<br>
Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I strike at it with my partisan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Do, if it will not stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis gone!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speech">We do it wrong, being so majestical,<br>
To offer it the show of violence;<br>
For it is, as the air, invulnerable,<br>
And our vain blows malicious mockery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">It was about to speak, when the cock crew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">And then it started like a guilty thing<br>
Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,<br>
The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,<br>
Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat<br>
Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,<br>
Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,<br>
The extravagant and erring spirit hies<br>
To his confine: and of the truth herein<br>
This present object made probation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">It faded on the crowing of the cock.<br>
Some say that ever &#8217;gainst that season comes<br>
Wherein our Saviour&#8217;s birth is celebrated,<br>
The bird of dawning singeth all night long:<br>
And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;<br>
The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,<br>
No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,<br>
So hallow&#8217;d and so gracious is the time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">So have I heard and do in part believe it.<br>
But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,<br>
Walks o&#8217;er the dew of yon high eastward hill:<br>
Break we our watch up; and by my advice,<br>
Let us impart what we have seen to-night<br>
Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,<br>
This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.<br>
Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,<br>
As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s do&#8217;t, I pray; and I this
morning know<br>
Where we shall find him most conveniently.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A room of state in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Claudius, Queen
Gertrude, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius, Lords,
and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother&#8217;s
death<br>
The memory be green, and that it us befitted<br>
To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom<br>
To be contracted in one brow of woe,<br>
Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature<br>
That we with wisest sorrow think on him,<br>
Together with remembrance of ourselves.<br>
Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,<br>
The imperial jointress to this warlike state,<br>
Have we, as &#8217;twere with a defeated joy,&#8212;<br>
With an auspicious and a dropping eye,<br>
With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,<br>
In equal scale weighing delight and dole,&#8212;<br>
Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr&#8217;d<br>
Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone<br>
With this affair along. For all, our thanks.<br>
Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,<br>
Holding a weak supposal of our worth,<br>
Or thinking by our late dear brother&#8217;s death<br>
Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,<br>
Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,<br>
He hath not fail&#8217;d to pester us with message,<br>
Importing the surrender of those lands<br>
Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,<br>
To our most valiant brother. So much for him.<br>
Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:<br>
Thus much the business is: we have here writ<br>
To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,&#8212;<br>
Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears<br>
Of this his nephew&#8217;s purpose,&#8212;to suppress<br>
His further gait herein; in that the levies,<br>
The lists and full proportions, are all made<br>
Out of his subject: and we here dispatch<br>
You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,<br>
For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;<br>
Giving to you no further personal power<br>
To business with the king, more than the scope<br>
Of these delated articles allow.<br>
Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speaker">Voltimand</p>
<p class="speech">In that and all things will we show our duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Voltimand and
Cornelius</span></p>
<p class="speech">And now, Laertes, what&#8217;s the news with
you?<br>
You told us of some suit; what is&#8217;t, Laertes?<br>
You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,<br>
And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,<br>
That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?<br>
The head is not more native to the heart,<br>
The hand more instrumental to the mouth,<br>
Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.<br>
What wouldst thou have, Laertes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">My dread lord,<br>
Your leave and favour to return to France;<br>
From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,<br>
To show my duty in your coronation,<br>
Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,<br>
My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France<br>
And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Have you your father&#8217;s leave? What says
Polonius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave<br>
By laboursome petition, and at last<br>
Upon his will I seal&#8217;d my hard consent:<br>
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,<br>
And thy best graces spend it at thy will!<br>
But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> A little more
than kin, and less than kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">How is it that the clouds still hang on you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; I am too much i&#8217; the
sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,<br>
And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.<br>
Do not for ever with thy vailed lids<br>
Seek for thy noble father in the dust:<br>
Thou know&#8217;st &#8217;tis common; all that lives must die,<br>
Passing through nature to eternity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, it is common.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">If it be,<br>
Why seems it so particular with thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not
&#8217;seems.&#8217;<br>
&#8217;Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,<br>
Nor customary suits of solemn black,<br>
Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,<br>
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,<br>
Nor the dejected &#8217;havior of the visage,<br>
Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,<br>
That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,<br>
For they are actions that a man might play:<br>
But I have that within which passeth show;<br>
These but the trappings and the suits of woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis sweet and commendable in your nature,
Hamlet,<br>
To give these mourning duties to your father:<br>
But, you must know, your father lost a father;<br>
That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound<br>
In filial obligation for some term<br>
To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever<br>
In obstinate condolement is a course<br>
Of impious stubbornness; &#8217;tis unmanly grief;<br>
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,<br>
A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,<br>
An understanding simple and unschool&#8217;d:<br>
For what we know must be and is as common<br>
As any the most vulgar thing to sense,<br>
Why should we in our peevish opposition<br>
Take it to heart? Fie! &#8217;tis a fault to heaven,<br>
A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,<br>
To reason most absurd: whose common theme<br>
Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,<br>
From the first corse till he that died to-day,<br>
&#8216;This must be so.&#8217; We pray you, throw to earth<br>
This unprevailing woe, and think of us<br>
As of a father: for let the world take note,<br>
You are the most immediate to our throne;<br>
And with no less nobility of love<br>
Than that which dearest father bears his son,<br>
Do I impart toward you. For your intent<br>
In going back to school in Wittenberg,<br>
It is most retrograde to our desire:<br>
And we beseech you, bend you to remain<br>
Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,<br>
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:<br>
I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I shall in all my best obey you, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis a loving and a fair reply:<br>
Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;<br>
This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet<br>
Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,<br>
No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,<br>
But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,<br>
And the king&#8217;s rouse the heavens all bruit again,<br>
Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Hamlet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, that this too too solid flesh would melt<br>
Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!<br>
Or that the Everlasting had not fix&#8217;d<br>
His canon &#8217;gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!<br>
How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,<br>
Seem to me all the uses of this world!<br>
Fie on&#8217;t! ah fie! &#8217;tis an unweeded garden,<br>
That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature<br>
Possess it merely. That it should come to this!<br>
But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:<br>
So excellent a king; that was, to this,<br>
Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother<br>
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven<br>
Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!<br>
Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,<br>
As if increase of appetite had grown<br>
By what it fed on: and yet, within a month&#8212;<br>
Let me not think on&#8217;t&#8212;Frailty, thy name is
woman!&#8212;<br>
A little month, or ere those shoes were old<br>
With which she follow&#8217;d my poor father&#8217;s body,<br>
Like Niobe, all tears:&#8212;why she, even she&#8212;<br>
O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,<br>
Would have mourn&#8217;d longer&#8212;married with my uncle,<br>
My father&#8217;s brother, but no more like my father<br>
Than I to Hercules: within a month:<br>
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears<br>
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,<br>
She married. O, most wicked speed, to post<br>
With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!<br>
It is not nor it cannot come to good:<br>
But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.</p>

<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">My good lord&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.<br>
But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A truant disposition, good my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I would not hear your enemy say so,<br>
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,<br>
To make it truster of your own report<br>
Against yourself: I know you are no truant.<br>
But what is your affair in Elsinore?<br>
We&#8217;ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I came to see your father&#8217;s
funeral.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;<br>
I think it was to see my mother&#8217;s wedding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, it follow&#8217;d hard upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked
meats<br>
Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.<br>
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven<br>
Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!<br>
My father!&#8212;methinks I see my father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Where, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In my mind&#8217;s eye,
Horatio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I saw him once; he was a goodly king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">He was a man, take him for all in all,<br>
I shall not look upon his like again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Saw? who?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the king your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The king my father!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Season your admiration for awhile<br>
With an attent ear, till I may deliver,<br>
Upon the witness of these gentlemen,<br>
This marvel to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">For God&#8217;s love, let me hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Two nights together had these gentlemen,<br>
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,<br>
In the dead vast and middle of the night,<br>
Been thus encounter&#8217;d. A figure like your father,<br>
Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,<br>
Appears before them, and with solemn march<br>
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk&#8217;d<br>
By their oppress&#8217;d and fear-surprised eyes,<br>
Within his truncheon&#8217;s length; whilst they, distilled<br>
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,<br>
Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me<br>
In dreadful secrecy impart they did;<br>
And I with them the third night kept the watch;<br>
Where, as they had deliver&#8217;d, both in time,<br>
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,<br>
The apparition comes: I knew your father;<br>
These hands are not more like.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">But where was this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, upon the platform where we
watch&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Did you not speak to it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I did;<br>
But answer made it none: yet once methought<br>
It lifted up its head and did address<br>
Itself to motion, like as it would speak;<br>
But even then the morning cock crew loud,<br>
And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,<br>
And vanish&#8217;d from our sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">As I do live, my honour&#8217;d lord, &#8217;tis
true;<br>
And we did think it writ down in our duty<br>
To let you know of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.<br>
Hold you the watch to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">We do, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">From top to toe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, from head to foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then saw you not his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What, look&#8217;d he frowningly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Pale or red?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, very pale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And fix&#8217;d his eyes upon
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Most constantly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I would I had been there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It would have much amazed you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Very like, very like. Stay&#8217;d it long?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">While one with moderate haste might tell a
hundred.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speaker">Bernardo</p>
<p class="speech">Longer, longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Not when I saw&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;His beard was
grizzled&#8212;no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It was, as I have seen it in his life,<br>
A sable silver&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will watch to-night;<br>
Perchance &#8217;twill walk again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant it will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">If it assume my noble father&#8217;s person,<br>
I&#8217;ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape<br>
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,<br>
If you have hitherto conceal&#8217;d this sight,<br>
Let it be tenable in your silence still;<br>
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,<br>
Give it an understanding, but no tongue:<br>
I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:<br>
Upon the platform, &#8217;twixt eleven and twelve,<br>

<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">My necessaries are embark&#8217;d: farewell:<br>
And, sister, as the winds give benefit<br>
And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,<br>
But let me hear from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">Do you doubt that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,<br>
Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,<br>
A violet in the youth of primy nature,<br>
Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,<br>
The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No more but so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Think it no more;<br>
For nature, crescent, does not grow alone<br>
In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,<br>
The inward service of the mind and soul<br>
Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,<br>
And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch<br>
The virtue of his will: but you must fear,<br>
His greatness weigh&#8217;d, his will is not his own;<br>
For he himself is subject to his birth:<br>
He may not, as unvalued persons do,<br>
Carve for himself; for on his choice depends<br>
The safety and health of this whole state;<br>
And therefore must his choice be circumscribed<br>
Unto the voice and yielding of that body<br>
Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,<br>
It fits your wisdom so far to believe it<br>
As he in his particular act and place<br>
May give his saying deed; which is no further<br>
Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.<br>
Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,<br>
If with too credent ear you list his songs,<br>
Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open<br>
To his unmaster&#8217;d importunity.<br>
Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,<br>
And keep you in the rear of your affection,<br>
Out of the shot and danger of desire.<br>
The chariest maid is prodigal enough,<br>
If she unmask her beauty to the moon:<br>
Virtue itself &#8217;scapes not calumnious strokes:<br>
The canker galls the infants of the spring,<br>
Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,<br>
And in the morn and liquid dew of youth<br>
Contagious blastments are most imminent.<br>
Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:<br>
Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,<br>
As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br>
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br>
Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;<br>
Whiles, like a puff&#8217;d and reckless libertine,<br>
Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,<br>
And recks not his own rede.</p>

Occasion smiles upon a second leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!<br>
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,<br>
And you are stay&#8217;d for. There; my blessing with thee!<br>
And these few precepts in thy memory<br>
See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,<br>
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.<br>
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.<br>
Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,<br>
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;<br>
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment<br>
Of each new-hatch&#8217;d, unfledged comrade. Beware<br>
Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,<br>
Bear&#8217;t that the opposed may beware of thee.<br>
Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;<br>
Take each man&#8217;s censure, but reserve thy judgment.<br>
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,<br>
But not express&#8217;d in fancy; rich, not gaudy;<br>
For the apparel oft proclaims the man,<br>
And they in France of the best rank and station<br>
Are of a most select and generous chief in that.<br>
Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<br>
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<br>
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.<br>
This above all: to thine ownself be true,<br>
And it must follow, as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!</p>

&#8217;Tis told me, he hath very oft of late<br>
Given private time to you; and you yourself<br>
Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:<br>
If it be so, as so &#8217;tis put on me,<br>
And that in way of caution, I must tell you,<br>
You do not understand yourself so clearly<br>
As it behoves my daughter and your honour.<br>
What is between you? give me up the truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders<br>
Of his affection to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,<br>
Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.<br>
Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?</p>

<p class="speech">I do not know, my lord, what I should think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I&#8217;ll teach you: think yourself a
baby;<br>
That you have ta&#8217;en these tenders for true pay,<br>
Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;<br>
Or&#8212;not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,<br>
Running it thus&#8212;you&#8217;ll tender me a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, he hath importuned me with love<br>
In honourable fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">And hath given countenance to his speech, my
lord,<br>
With almost all the holy vows of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,<br>
When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul<br>
Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,<br>
Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,<br>
Even in their promise, as it is a-making,<br>
You must not take for fire. From this time<br>
Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;<br>
Set your entreatments at a higher rate<br>
Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,<br>
Believe so much in him, that he is young<br>
And with a larger tether may he walk<br>
Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,<br>
Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,<br>
Not of that dye which their investments show,<br>
But mere implorators of unholy suits,<br>
Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,<br>
The better to beguile. This is for all:<br>
I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,<br>
Have you so slander any moment leisure,<br>
As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.<br>
Look to&#8217;t, I charge you: come your ways.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, is&#8217;t:<br>
But to my mind, though I am native here<br>
And to the manner born, it is a custom<br>
More honour&#8217;d in the breach than the observance.<br>
This heavy-headed revel east and west<br>
Makes us traduced and tax&#8217;d of other nations:<br>
They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase<br>
Soil our addition; and indeed it takes<br>
From our achievements, though perform&#8217;d at height,<br>
The pith and marrow of our attribute.<br>
So, oft it chances in particular men,<br>
That for some vicious mole of nature in them,<br>

Since nature cannot choose his origin&#8212;<br>
By the o&#8217;ergrowth of some complexion,<br>
Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,<br>
Or by some habit that too much o&#8217;er-leavens<br>

That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel<br>
Revisit&#8217;st thus the glimpses of the moon,<br>
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature<br>
So horridly to shake our disposition<br>
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?<br>
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Ghost beckons

I do not set my life in a pin&#8217;s fee;<br>

It waves me forth again: I&#8217;ll follow it.</p>

Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff<br>
That beetles o&#8217;er his base into the sea,<br>
And there assume some other horrible form,<br>
Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason<br>
And draw you into madness? think of it:<br>
The very place puts toys of desperation,<br>
Without more motive, into every brain<br>
That looks so many fathoms to the sea<br>
And hears it roar beneath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">It waves me still.<br>

Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature<br>
Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid<br>
To tell the secrets of my prison-house,<br>
I could a tale unfold whose lightest word<br>
Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,<br>
Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,<br>
Thy knotted and combined locks to part<br>
And each particular hair to stand on end,<br>
Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:<br>
But this eternal blazon must not be<br>
To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!<br>
If thou didst ever thy dear father love&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O God!</p>

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Murder!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Murder most foul, as in the best it is;<br>
But this most foul, strange and unnatural.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Haste me to know&#8217;t, that I, with wings as
swift<br>
As meditation or the thoughts of love,<br>
May sweep to my revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">I find thee apt;<br>
And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed<br>
That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,<br>
Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:<br>
&#8217;Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,<br>
A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark<br>
Is by a forged process of my death<br>
Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,<br>
The serpent that did sting thy father&#8217;s life<br>
Now wears his crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O my prophetic soul! My uncle!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,<br>
With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,&#8212;<br>
O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power<br>
So to seduce!&#8212;won to his shameful lust<br>
The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:<br>
O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!<br>
From me, whose love was of that dignity<br>
That it went hand in hand even with the vow<br>
I made to her in marriage, and to decline<br>
Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor<br>
To those of mine!<br>
But virtue, as it never will be moved,<br>
Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,<br>
So lust, though to a radiant angel link&#8217;d,<br>
Will sate itself in a celestial bed,<br>
And prey on garbage.<br>
But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;<br>
Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,<br>
My custom always of the afternoon,<br>
Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,<br>
With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,<br>
And in the porches of my ears did pour<br>
The leperous distilment; whose effect<br>
Holds such an enmity with blood of man<br>
That swift as quicksilver it courses through<br>
The natural gates and alleys of the body,<br>
And with a sudden vigour doth posset<br>
And curd, like eager droppings into milk,<br>
The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;<br>
And a most instant tetter bark&#8217;d about,<br>
Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,<br>
All my smooth body.<br>
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother&#8217;s hand<br>
Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch&#8217;d:<br>
Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,<br>
Unhousel&#8217;d, disappointed, unanel&#8217;d,<br>
No reckoning made, but sent to my account<br>
With all my imperfections on my head:<br>
O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!<br>
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;<br>
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be<br>
A couch for luxury and damned incest.<br>
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,<br>
Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive<br>
Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven<br>
And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,<br>
To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!<br>
The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,<br>
And &#8217;gins to pale his uneffectual fire:<br>
Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speech">O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?<br>
And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;<br>
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,<br>
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!<br>
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat<br>
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!<br>
Yea, from the table of my memory<br>
I&#8217;ll wipe away all trivial fond records,<br>
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,<br>
That youth and observation copied there;<br>
And thy commandment all alone shall live<br>
Within the book and volume of my brain,<br>
Unmix&#8217;d with baser matter: yes, by heaven!<br>
O most pernicious woman!<br>
O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!<br>

And so, without more circumstance at all,<br>
I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:<br>
You, as your business and desire shall point you;<br>
For every man has business and desire,<br>
Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,<br>
Look you, I&#8217;ll go pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">These are but wild and whirling words, my

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;m sorry they offend you, heartily;<br>
Yes, &#8217;faith heartily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no offence, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,<br>
And much offence too. Touching this vision here,<br>
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:<br>
For your desire to know what is between us,<br>
O&#8217;ermaster &#8217;t as you may. And now, good friends,<br>
As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,<br>
Give me one poor request.</p>

<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we will not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but swear&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nor I, my lord, in faith.</p>

<p class="speaker">Marcellus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We have sworn, my lord,

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.<br>
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,<br>
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;<br>
Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,<br>
How strange or odd soe&#8217;er I bear myself,<br>
As I perchance hereafter shall think meet<br>
To put an antic disposition on,<br>
That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,<br>
With arms encumber&#8217;d thus, or this headshake,<br>
Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,<br>
As &#8216;Well, well, we know,&#8217; or &#8216;We could, an if we
would,&#8217;<br>
Or &#8216;If we list to speak,&#8217; or &#8216;There be, an if
they might,&#8217;<br>
Or such ambiguous giving out, to note<br>
That you know aught of me: this not to do,<br>
So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ghost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Beneath]</span> Swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They swear</span></p>
<p class="speech">So, gentlemen,<br>
With all my love I do commend me to you:<br>
And what so poor a man as Hamlet is<br>
May do, to express his love and friending to you,<br>
God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;<br>
And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.<br>
The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,<br>

Nay, come, let&#8217;s go together.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>

sir,<br>
Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;<br>
And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,<br>
What company, at what expense; and finding<br>
By this encompassment and drift of question<br>
That they do know my son, come you more nearer<br>
Than your particular demands will touch it:<br>
Take you, as &#8217;twere, some distant knowledge of him;<br>
As thus, &#8216;I know his father and his friends,<br>

Addicted so and so:&#8217; and there put on him<br>
What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank<br>
As may dishonour him; take heed of that;<br>
But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips<br>
As are companions noted and most known<br>
To youth and liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reynaldo</p>
<p class="speech">As gaming, my lord.</p>

quarrelling,<br>
Drabbing: you may go so far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reynaldo</p>

<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, no; as you may season it in the
charge<br>
You must not put another scandal on him,<br>
That he is open to incontinency;<br>
That&#8217;s not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly<br>
That they may seem the taints of liberty,<br>
The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,<br>
A savageness in unreclaimed blood,<br>
Of general assault.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Marry, sir, here&#8217;s my

You laying these slight sullies on my son,<br>
As &#8217;twere a thing a little soil&#8217;d i&#8217; the working,
Mark you,<br>
Your party in converse, him you would sound,<br>
Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes<br>
The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured<br>
He closes with you in this consequence;<br>
&#8216;Good sir,&#8217; or so, or &#8216;friend,&#8217; or
&#8216;gentleman,&#8217;<br>
According to the phrase or the addition<br>
Of man and country.</p>

<p class="speech">And then, sir, does he this&#8212;he

about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
something: where did I leave?</p>

Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,<br>
There was a&#8217; gaming; there o&#8217;ertook in&#8217;s
rouse;<br>
There falling out at tennis:&#8217; or perchance,<br>
&#8216;I saw him enter such a house of sale,&#8217;<br>
Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.<br>
See you now;<br>
Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:<br>
And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,<br>
With windlasses and with assays of bias,<br>
By indirections find directions out:<br>
So by my former lecture and advice,<br>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, I do not know;<br>
But truly, I do fear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">What said he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">He took me by the wrist and held me hard;<br>
Then goes he to the length of all his arm;<br>
And, with his other hand thus o&#8217;er his brow,<br>
He falls to such perusal of my face<br>
As he would draw it. Long stay&#8217;d he so;<br>
At last, a little shaking of mine arm<br>
And thrice his head thus waving up and down,<br>
He raised a sigh so piteous and profound<br>
As it did seem to shatter all his bulk<br>
And end his being: that done, he lets me go:<br>
And, with his head over his shoulder turn&#8217;d,<br>
He seem&#8217;d to find his way without his eyes;<br>
For out o&#8217; doors he went without their helps,<br>
And, to the last, bended their light on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.<br>
This is the very ecstasy of love,<br>
Whose violent property fordoes itself<br>
And leads the will to desperate undertakings<br>
As oft as any passion under heaven<br>
That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.<br>
What, have you given him any hard words of late?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord, but, as you did command,<br>
I did repel his fetters and denied<br>
His access to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That hath made him mad.<br>
I am sorry that with better heed and judgment<br>
I had not quoted him: I fear&#8217;d he did but trifle,<br>
And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!<br>
By heaven, it is as proper to our age<br>
To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions<br>
As it is common for the younger sort<br>
To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:<br>
This must be known; which, being kept close, might
move<br>
More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</p>

Gertrude, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!<br>
Moreover that we much did long to see you,<br>
The need we have to use you did provoke<br>
Our hasty sending. Something have you heard<br>
Of Hamlet&#8217;s transformation; so call it,<br>
Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man<br>
Resembles that it was. What it should be,<br>
More than his father&#8217;s death, that thus hath put him<br>
So much from the understanding of himself,<br>
I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,<br>
That, being of so young days brought up with him,<br>
And sith so neighbour&#8217;d to his youth and havior,<br>
That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court<br>
Some little time: so by your companies<br>
To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,<br>
So much as from occasion you may glean,<br>
Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,<br>
That, open&#8217;d, lies within our remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Good gentlemen, he hath much talk&#8217;d of
you;<br>
And sure I am two men there are not living<br>
To whom he more adheres. If it will please you<br>
To show us so much gentry and good will<br>
As to expend your time with us awhile,<br>
For the supply and profit of our hope,<br>
Your visitation shall receive such thanks<br>
As fits a king&#8217;s remembrance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Both your majesties<br>
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,<br>
Put your dread pleasures more into command<br>
Than to entreaty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But we both obey,<br>
And here give up ourselves, in the full bent<br>

<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>

And I beseech you instantly to visit<br>
My too much changed son. Go, some of you,<br>
And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>

<p class="speech">Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,<br>
I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,<br>
Both to my God and to my gracious king:<br>
And I do think, or else this brain of mine<br>
Hunts not the trail of policy so sure<br>
As it hath used to do, that I have found<br>
The very cause of Hamlet&#8217;s lunacy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>

The head and source of all your son&#8217;s distemper.</p>

<p class="speech">I doubt it is no other but the main;<br>
His father&#8217;s death, and our o&#8217;erhasty marriage.</p>

Voltimand and Cornelius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my good friends!<br>
Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?</p>
<p class="speaker">Voltimand</p>
<p class="speech">Most fair return of greetings and desires.<br>
Upon our first, he sent out to suppress<br>
His nephew&#8217;s levies; which to him appear&#8217;d<br>
To be a preparation &#8217;gainst the Polack;<br>
But, better look&#8217;d into, he truly found<br>
It was against your highness: whereat grieved,<br>
That so his sickness, age and impotence<br>
Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests<br>
On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;<br>
Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine<br>
Makes vow before his uncle never more<br>
To give the assay of arms against your majesty.<br>
Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,<br>
Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,<br>
And his commission to employ those soldiers,<br>
So levied as before, against the Polack:<br>
With an entreaty, herein further shown,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving a paper</span></p>
<p class="speech">That it might please you to give quiet pass<br>
Through your dominions for this enterprise,<br>
On such regards of safety and allowance<br>
As therein are set down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">It likes us well;<br>
And at our more consider&#8217;d time well read,<br>
Answer, and think upon this business.<br>

Go to your rest; at night we&#8217;ll feast together:<br>
Most welcome home!</p>

Cornelius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;This business is well ended.<br>
My liege, and madam, to expostulate<br>
What majesty should be, what duty is,<br>
Why day is day, night night, and time is time,<br>
Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.<br>
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,<br>
And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,<br>
I will be brief: your noble son is mad:<br>
Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,<br>
What is&#8217;t but to be nothing else but mad?<br>
But let that go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;More matter, with less art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I swear I use no art at all.<br>
That he is mad, &#8217;tis true: &#8217;tis true &#8217;tis
pity;<br>
And pity &#8217;tis &#8217;tis true: a foolish figure;<br>
But farewell it, for I will use no art.<br>
Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains<br>
That we find out the cause of this effect,<br>
Or rather say, the cause of this defect,<br>
For this effect defective comes by cause:<br>
Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.<br>
I have a daughter&#8212;have while she is mine&#8212;<br>
Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,<br>
Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;To the celestial and my soul&#8217;s idol,
the most
beautified Ophelia,&#8217;&#8212;
That&#8217;s an ill phrase, a vile phrase; &#8216;beautified&#8217;
is
a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;In her excellent white bosom, these, &amp;c.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Came this from Hamlet to her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br>
Doubt that the sun doth move;<br>
Doubt truth to be a liar;<br>
But never doubt I love.<br>
&#8216;O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;<br>
I have not art to reckon my groans: but that<br>
I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.<br>
&#8216;Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst<br>
this machine is to him, Hamlet.&#8217;<br></p>
<p class="speech">
This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,<br>
And more above, hath his solicitings,<br>
As they fell out by time, by means and place,<br>
All given to mine ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">But how hath she<br>
Received his love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What do you think of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">As of a man faithful and honourable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">I would fain prove so. But what might you
think,<br>
When I had seen this hot love on the wing&#8212;<br>
As I perceived it, I must tell you that,<br>
Before my daughter told me&#8212;what might you,<br>
Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,<br>
If I had play&#8217;d the desk or table-book,<br>
Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,<br>
Or look&#8217;d upon this love with idle sight;<br>
What might you think? No, I went round to work,<br>
And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:<br>
&#8216;Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;<br>
This must not be:&#8217; and then I precepts gave her,<br>
That she should lock herself from his resort,<br>
Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.<br>
Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;<br>
And he, repulsed&#8212;a short tale to make&#8212;<br>
Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,<br>
Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,<br>
Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,<br>
Into the madness wherein now he raves,<br>
And all we mourn for.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Do you think &#8217;tis this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">It may be, very likely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Hath there been such a time&#8212;I&#8217;d fain
know that&#8212;<br>
That I have positively said &#8217;Tis so,&#8217;<br>
When it proved otherwise?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Not that I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Pointing to his head and
shoulder]</span><br>
Take this from this, if this be otherwise:<br>
If circumstances lead me, I will find<br>
Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed<br>
Within the centre.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;How may we try it further?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">You know, sometimes he walks four hours
together<br>
Here in the lobby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;So he does indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">At such a time I&#8217;ll loose my daughter to
him:<br>
Be you and I behind an arras then;<br>
Mark the encounter: if he love her not<br>
And be not from his reason fall&#8217;n thereon,<br>
Let me be no assistant for a state,<br>
But keep a farm and carters.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">We will try it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes
reading.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Away, I do beseech you, both away:<br>
I&#8217;ll board him presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Claudius, Queen
Gertrude, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hamlet,
reading</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, give me leave:<br>
How does my good Lord Hamlet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, God-a-mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Do you know me, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then I would you were so honest a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Honest, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to
be
one man picked out of ten thousand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s very true, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being
a
god kissing carrion,&#8212;Have you a daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">I have, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Let her not walk i&#8217; the sun: conception is
a
blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
Friend, look to &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How say you by
that? Still harping on my
daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
love; very near this. I&#8217;ll speak to him again.
What do you read, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Words, words, words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Between who?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says
here
that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
you could go backward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Though this be
madness, yet there is method
in &#8217;t. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Into my grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, that is out o&#8217; the air.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a
happiness
that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
meeting between him and my daughter.&#8212;My honourable
lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I
will
more willingly part withal: except my life, except
my life, except my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Fare you well, my lord.</p>

<p class="speech">My excellent good friends! How dost thou,<br>
Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">As the indifferent children of the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">Happy, in that we are not over-happy;<br>
On fortune&#8217;s cap we are not the very button.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nor the soles of her shoe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Neither, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then you live about her waist, or in the middle
of
her favours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, her privates we.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true;
she
is a strumpet. What&#8217;s the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">None, my lord, but that the world&#8217;s grown
honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then is doomsday near: but your news is not
true.
Let me question more in particular: what have you,
my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
that she sends you to prison hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">Prison, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Denmark&#8217;s a prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Then is the world one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">A goodly one; in which there are many
confines,
wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o&#8217; the worst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">We think not so, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, &#8217;tis none to you; for there is
nothing
either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
it is a prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, your ambition makes it one; &#8217;tis
too
narrow for your mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and
count
myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
have bad dreams.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the
very
substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">A dream itself is but a shadow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light
a
quality that it is but a shadow&#8217;s shadow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs
and
outstretched heroes the beggars&#8217; shadows. Shall we
to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll wait upon you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No such matter: I will not sort you with the
rest
of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but
I
thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">What should we say, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were
sent
for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
I know the good king and queen have sent for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">To what end, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">That you must teach me. But let me conjure you,
by
the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for, or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to
Guildenstern]</span> What say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Nay, then, I
have an eye of you.&#8212;If you
love me, hold not off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we were sent for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
and queen moult no feather. I have of late&#8212;but
wherefore I know not&#8212;lost all my mirth, forgone all
custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
o&#8217;erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
you seem to say so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, there was no such stuff in my
thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why did you laugh then, when I said &#8216;man
delights not me&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">To think, my lord, if you delight not in man,
what
lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
coming, to offer you service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">He that plays the king shall be welcome; his
majesty
shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
lungs are tickled o&#8217; the sere; and the lady shall
say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
for&#8217;t. What players are they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Even those you were wont to take delight in,
the
tragedians of the city.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How chances it they travel? their residence,
both
in reputation and profit, was better both ways.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">I think their inhibition comes by the means of
the
late innovation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Do they hold the same estimation they did when I
was
in the city? are they so followed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, are they not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How comes it? do they grow rusty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace:
but
there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
that cry out on the top of question, and are most
tyrannically clapped for&#8217;t: these are now the
fashion, and so berattle the common stages&#8212;so they
call them&#8212;that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What, are they children? who maintains &#8217;em?
how are
they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
longer than they can sing? will they not say
afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
players&#8212;as it is most like, if their means are no
better&#8212;their writers do them wrong, to make them
exclaim against their own succession?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, there has been much to do on both
sides; and
the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
cuffs in the question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">O, there has been much throwing about of
brains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Do the boys carry it away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king
of
Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
&#8217;sblood, there is something in this more than
natural, if philosophy could find it out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish of trumpets
within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">There are the players.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your
hands,
come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
must show fairly outward, should more appear like
entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">In what, my dear lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind
is
southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Polonius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Well be with you, gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear
a
hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
out of his swaddling-clouts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Happily he&#8217;s the second time come to them;
for they
say an old man is twice a child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the
players;
mark it. You say right, sir: o&#8217; Monday morning;
&#8217;twas so indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I have news to tell you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I have news to tell you.<br>
When Roscius was an actor in Rome,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">The actors are come hither, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Buz, buz!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Then came each actor on his ass,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">The best actors in the world, either for
tragedy,
comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
liberty, these are the only men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure
hadst thou!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">What a treasure had he, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why,<br>
&#8216;One fair daughter and no more,<br>
The which he loved passing well.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Still on my
daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not i&#8217; the right, old Jephthah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a
daughter
that I love passing well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that follows not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">What follows, then, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why,
&#8216;As by lot, God wot,&#8217;
and then, you know,
&#8216;It came to pass, as most like it was,&#8217;&#8212;
the first row of the pious chanson will show you
more; for look, where my abridgement comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter four or five
Players</span></p>
<p class="speech">You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am
glad
to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
lady and mistress! By&#8217;r lady, your ladyship is
nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We&#8217;ll e&#8217;en
to&#8217;t like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
we&#8217;ll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
of your quality; come, a passionate speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">What speech, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it
was
never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
play, I remember, pleased not the million; &#8217;twas
caviare to the general: but it was&#8212;as I received
it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine&#8212;an excellent play, well
digested in the scenes, set down with as much
modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
indict the author of affectation; but called it an
honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
chiefly loved: &#8217;twas Aeneas&#8217; tale to Dido; and
thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
Priam&#8217;s slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
at this line: let me see, let me see&#8212;
&#8216;The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian
beast,&#8217;&#8212;
it is not so:&#8212;it begins with Pyrrhus:&#8212;<br>
&#8216;The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,<br>
Black as his purpose, did the night resemble<br>
When he lay couched in the ominous horse,<br>
Hath now this dread and black complexion smear&#8217;d<br>
With heraldry more dismal; head to foot<br>
Now is he total gules; horridly trick&#8217;d<br>
With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,<br>
Baked and impasted with the parching streets,<br>
That lend a tyrannous and damned light<br>
To their lord&#8217;s murder: roasted in wrath and fire,<br>
And thus o&#8217;er-sized with coagulate gore,<br>
With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus<br>
Old grandsire Priam seeks.&#8217;<br>
So, proceed you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good
accent and
good discretion.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Anon he finds him<br>
Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,<br>
Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,<br>
Repugnant to command: unequal match&#8217;d,<br>
Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;<br>
But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword<br>
The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,<br>
Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top<br>
Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash<br>
Takes prisoner Pyrrhus&#8217; ear: for, lo! his sword,<br>
Which was declining on the milky head<br>
Of reverend Priam, seem&#8217;d i&#8217; the air to stick:<br>
So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,<br>
And like a neutral to his will and matter,<br>
Did nothing.<br>
But, as we often see, against some storm,<br>
A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,<br>
The bold winds speechless and the orb below<br>
As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder<br>
Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus&#8217; pause,<br>
Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;<br>
And never did the Cyclops&#8217; hammers fall<br>
On Mars&#8217;s armour forged for proof eterne<br>
With less remorse than Pyrrhus&#8217; bleeding sword<br>
Now falls on Priam.<br>
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,<br>
In general synod &#8216;take away her power;<br>
Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,<br>
And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,<br>
As low as to the fiends!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">This is too long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">It shall to the barber&#8217;s, with your beard.
Prithee,
say on: he&#8217;s for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;But who, O, who had seen the mobled
queen&#8212;&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;The mobled queen?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s good; &#8216;mobled queen&#8217; is
good.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Run barefoot up and down, threatening the
flames<br>
With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head<br>
Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,<br>
About her lank and all o&#8217;er-teemed loins,<br>
A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;<br>
Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep&#8217;d,<br>
&#8217;Gainst Fortune&#8217;s state would treason have
pronounced:<br>
But if the gods themselves did see her then<br>
When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport<br>
In mincing with his sword her husband&#8217;s limbs,<br>
The instant burst of clamour that she made,<br>
Unless things mortal move them not at all,<br>
Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,<br>
And passion in the gods.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Look, whether he has not turned his colour and
has
tears in&#8217;s eyes. Pray you, no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well: I&#8217;ll have thee speak out
the rest soon.
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
time: after your death you were better have a bad
epitaph than their ill report while you live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I will use them according to their
desert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s bodykins, man, much better: use every
man
after his desert, and who should &#8217;scape whipping?
Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
Take them in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Polonius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sirs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Follow him, friends: we&#8217;ll hear a play
to-morrow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Polonius with all the
Players but the First</span></p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play

<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll ha&#8217;t to-morrow night. You
could, for a need,
study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
I would set down and insert in&#8217;t, could you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock
him
not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit First Player</span></p>
<p class="speech">My good friends, I&#8217;ll leave you till night:

welcome to Elsinore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so, God be wi&#8217; ye;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now I am alone.<br>
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!<br>
Is it not monstrous that this player here,<br>
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,<br>
Could force his soul so to his own conceit<br>
That from her working all his visage wann&#8217;d,<br>
Tears in his eyes, distraction in&#8217;s aspect,<br>
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting<br>
With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!<br>
For Hecuba!<br>
What&#8217;s Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,<br>
That he should weep for her? What would he do,<br>
Had he the motive and the cue for passion<br>
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears<br>
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,<br>
Make mad the guilty and appal the free,<br>
Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed<br>
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,<br>
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,<br>
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,<br>
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,<br>
Upon whose property and most dear life<br>
A damn&#8217;d defeat was made. Am I a coward?<br>
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?<br>
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?<br>
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i&#8217; the throat,<br>
As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?<br>
Ha!<br>
&#8217;swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be<br>
But I am pigeon-liver&#8217;d and lack gall<br>
To make oppression bitter, or ere this<br>
I should have fatted all the region kites<br>
With this slave&#8217;s offal: bloody, bawdy villain!<br>
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<br>
O, vengeance!<br>
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,<br>
That I, the son of a dear father murder&#8217;d,<br>
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,<br>
Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,<br>
And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,<br>
A scullion!<br>
Fie upon&#8217;t! foh! About, my brain! I have heard<br>
That guilty creatures sitting at a play<br>
Have by the very cunning of the scene<br>
Been struck so to the soul that presently<br>
They have proclaim&#8217;d their malefactions;<br>
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak<br>
With most miraculous organ. I&#8217;ll have these players<br>
Play something like the murder of my father<br>
Before mine uncle: I&#8217;ll observe his looks;<br>
I&#8217;ll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,<br>
I know my course. The spirit that I have seen<br>
May be the devil: and the devil hath power<br>
To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps<br>
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,<br>
As he is very potent with such spirits,<br>
Abuses me to damn me: I&#8217;ll have grounds<br>
More relative than this: the play &#8217;s the thing<br>
Wherein I&#8217;ll catch the conscience of the king.</p>

Whether &#8217;tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br>
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br>
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br>
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br>
That flesh is heir to, &#8217;tis a consummation<br>
Devoutly to be wish&#8217;d. To die, to sleep;<br>
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there&#8217;s the rub;<br>
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br>
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br>
Must give us pause: there&#8217;s the respect<br>
That makes calamity of so long life;<br>
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br>
The oppressor&#8217;s wrong, the proud man&#8217;s contumely,<br>
The pangs of despised love, the law&#8217;s delay,<br>
The insolence of office and the spurns<br>
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br>
When he himself might his quietus make<br>
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br>
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br>
But that the dread of something after death,<br>
The undiscover&#8217;d country from whose bourn<br>
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br>
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br>
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br>
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br>
And thus the native hue of resolution<br>
Is sicklied o&#8217;er with the pale cast of thought,<br>
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br>
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br>

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No, not I;<br>
I never gave you aught.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">My honour&#8217;d lord, you know right well you
did;<br>
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed<br>
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,<br>
Take these again; for to the noble mind<br>
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.<br>
There, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! are you honest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Are you fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">What means your lordship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
should
admit no discourse to your beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce
than
with honesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will
sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">You should not have believed me; for virtue
cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">I was the more deceived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where&#8217;s your father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">At home, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play
the
fool no where but in&#8217;s own house. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">O, help him, you sweet heavens!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">If thou dost marry, I&#8217;ll give thee this
plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ophelia</p>
<p class="speech">O heavenly powers, restore him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard of your paintings too, well enough;
God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God&#8217;s creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I&#8217;ll no more on&#8217;t; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.</p>

Players</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it
to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o&#8217;erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant your honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Be not too tame neither, but let your own
discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o&#8217;erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as &#8217;twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o&#8217;erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature&#8217;s journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Player</p>
<p class="speech">I hope we have reformed that indifferently with
us,
sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, reform it altogether. And let those that
play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that&#8217;s villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.</p>

For what advancement may I hope from thee<br>
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,<br>
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
flatter&#8217;d?<br>
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,<br>
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee<br>
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?<br>
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice<br>
And could of men distinguish, her election<br>
Hath seal&#8217;d thee for herself; for thou hast been<br>
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,<br>
A man that fortune&#8217;s buffets and rewards<br>
Hast ta&#8217;en with equal thanks: and blest are those<br>
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,<br>
That they are not a pipe for fortune&#8217;s finger<br>
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man<br>
That is not passion&#8217;s slave, and I will wear him<br>
In my heart&#8217;s core, ay, in my heart of heart,<br>
As I do thee.&#8212;Something too much of this.&#8212;<br>
There is a play to-night before the king;<br>
One scene of it comes near the circumstance<br>
Which I have told thee of my father&#8217;s death:<br>
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,<br>
Even with the very comment of thy soul<br>
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt<br>
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,<br>
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,<br>
And my imaginations are as foul<br>
As Vulcan&#8217;s stithy. Give him heedful note;<br>
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,<br>
And after we will both our judgments join<br>
In censure of his seeming.</p>

So far from cheer and from your former state,<br>
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,<br>
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:<br>
For women&#8217;s fear and love holds quantity;<br>
In neither aught, or in extremity.<br>
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;<br>

But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.<br>
Most necessary &#8217;tis that we forget<br>
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:<br>

The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.<br>
The violence of either grief or joy<br>
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:<br>
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;<br>
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.<br>
This world is not for aye, nor &#8217;tis not strange<br>
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;<br>
For &#8217;tis a question left us yet to prove,<br>
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.<br>
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;<br>
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.<br>
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;<br>
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,<br>
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,<br>
Directly seasons him his enemy.<br>
But, orderly to end where I begun,<br>
Our wills and fates do so contrary run<br>
That our devices still are overthrown;<br>
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:<br>

A station like the herald Mercury<br>
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;<br>

To give the world assurance of a man:<br>
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:<br>
Here is your husband; like a mildew&#8217;d ear,<br>

You cannot call it love; for at your age<br>
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it&#8217;s humble,<br>

Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,<br>
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense<br>

Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,<br>

Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:<br>
Speak to her, Hamlet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How is it with you, lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, how is&#8217;t with you,<br>
That you do bend your eye on vacancy<br>
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?<br>
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;<br>
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,<br>
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,<br>
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,<br>
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper<br>
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!<br>
His form and cause conjoin&#8217;d, preaching to stones,<br>
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;<br>
Lest with this piteous action you convert<br>
My stern effects: then what I have to do<br>
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">To whom do you speak this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Do you see nothing there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nor did you nothing hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">No, nothing but ourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, look you there! look, how it steals
away!<br>
My father, in his habit as he lived!<br>
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ghost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">This the very coinage of your brain:<br>
This bodiless creation ecstasy<br>
Is very cunning in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ecstasy!<br>
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,<br>
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness<br>
That I have utter&#8217;d: bring me to the test,<br>
And I the matter will re-word; which madness<br>
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,<br>
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,<br>
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:<br>
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,<br>
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,<br>
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;<br>
Repent what&#8217;s past; avoid what is to come;<br>
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,<br>
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;<br>
For in the fatness of these pursy times<br>
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,<br>
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, throw away the worser part of it,<br>
And live the purer with the other half.<br>
Good night: but go not to mine uncle&#8217;s bed;<br>
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.<br>
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,<br>
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,<br>
That to the use of actions fair and good<br>
He likewise gives a frock or livery,<br>
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,<br>
And that shall lend a kind of easiness<br>
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;<br>
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,<br>
And either ... the devil, or throw him
out<br>
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:<br>
And when you are desirous to be bless&#8217;d,<br>
I&#8217;ll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to
Polonius</span></p>
<p class="speech">I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,<br>
To punish me with this and this with me,<br>
That I must be their scourge and minister.<br>
I will bestow him, and will answer well<br>
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.<br>
I must be cruel, only to be kind:<br>
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.<br>
One word more, good lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:<br>
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;<br>
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;<br>
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,<br>
Or paddling in your neck with his damn&#8217;d fingers,<br>
Make you to ravel all this matter out,<br>
That I essentially am not in madness,<br>
But mad in craft. &#8217;Twere good you let him know;<br>
For who, that&#8217;s but a queen, fair, sober, wise,<br>
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,<br>
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?<br>
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,<br>
Unpeg the basket on the house&#8217;s top.<br>
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,<br>
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,<br>
And break your own neck down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,<br>
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe<br>
What thou hast said to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I must to England; you know that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Alack,<br>
I had forgot: &#8217;tis so concluded on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s letters seal&#8217;d: and my two
schoolfellows,<br>
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang&#8217;d,<br>
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,<br>
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;<br>
For &#8217;tis the sport to have the engineer<br>
Hoist with his own petard: and &#8217;t shall go hard<br>
But I will delve one yard below their mines,<br>
And blow them at the moon: O, &#8217;tis most sweet,<br>
When in one line two crafts directly meet.<br>
This man shall set me packing:<br>
I&#8217;ll lug the guts into the neighbour room.<br>
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor<br>
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,<br>
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.<br>
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.<br>
Good night, mother.</p>

Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br>
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,<br>
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great<br>

Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br>
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,<br>
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br>
For good Polonius&#8217; death; and we have done but greenly,<br>
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia<br>
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br>
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:<br>
Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>
Her brother is in secret come from France;<br>
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br>
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>
With pestilent speeches of his father&#8217;s death;<br>
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&#8217;d,<br>

&#8216;Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.<br></p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It well appears: but tell me<br>
Why you proceeded not against these feats,<br>
So crimeful and so capital in nature,<br>
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,<br>
You mainly were stirr&#8217;d up.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O, for two special reasons;<br>
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew&#8217;d,<br>
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother<br>
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself&#8212;<br>
My virtue or my plague, be it either which&#8212;<br>
She&#8217;s so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br>
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br>
I could not but by her. The other motive,<br>
Why to a public count I might not go,<br>
Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br>
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br>
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br>
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br>
Too slightly timber&#8217;d for so loud a wind,<br>
Would have reverted to my bow again,<br>
And not where I had aim&#8217;d them.</p>

<p class="speech">I&#8217;m lost in it, my lord. But let him

That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,<br>
&#8216;Thus didest thou.&#8217;</p>

So you will not o&#8217;errule me to a peace.</p>

<p class="speech">To thine own peace. If he be now
return&#8217;d,<br>
As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br>
No more to undertake it, I will work him<br>
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br>
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:<br>
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br>
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise<br>
And call it accident.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I will be ruled;<br>
The rather, if you could devise it so<br>
That I might be the organ.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">It falls right.<br>
You have been talk&#8217;d of since your travel much,<br>
And that in Hamlet&#8217;s hearing, for a quality<br>
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts<br>
Did not together pluck such envy from him<br>
As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br>
Of the unworthiest siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">What part is that, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">A very riband in the cap of youth,<br>
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes<br>
The light and careless livery that it wears<br>
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br>
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,<br>
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:&#8212;<br>
I&#8217;ve seen myself, and served against, the French,<br>
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant<br>
Had witchcraft in&#8217;t; he grew unto his seat;<br>
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br>
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured<br>
With the brave beast: so far he topp&#8217;d my thought,<br>
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br>
Come short of what he did.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">The very same.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I know him well: he is the brooch indeed<br>
And gem of all the nation.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">He made confession of you,<br>
And gave you such a masterly report<br>
For art and exercise in your defence<br>
And for your rapier most especially,<br>
That he cried out, &#8217;twould be a sight indeed,<br>
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,<br>
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br>
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br>
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br>
That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br>
Your sudden coming o&#8217;er, to play with him.<br>
Now, out of this,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">What out of this, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br>
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br>
A face without a heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Why ask you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Not that I think you did not love your
father;<br>
But that I know love is begun by time;<br>
And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>
There lives within the very flame of love<br>
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br>
And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br>
Dies in his own too much: that we would do<br>
We should do when we would; for this &#8216;would&#8217;
changes<br>
And hath abatements and delays as many<br>
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>
And then this &#8216;should&#8217; is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o&#8217; the
ulcer:&#8212;<br>
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,<br>
To show yourself your father&#8217;s son in deed<br>
More than in words?</p>

Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br>
Hamlet return&#8217;d shall know you are come home:<br>
We&#8217;ll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>
And set a double varnish on the fame<br>
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br>
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br>
Most generous and free from all contriving,<br>
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,<br>
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise<br>
Requite him for your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I will do&#8217;t:<br>
And, for that purpose, I&#8217;ll anoint my sword.<br>
I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br>
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>
Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>
Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br>
That is but scratch&#8217;d withal: I&#8217;ll touch my point<br>
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br>
It may be death.</p>

Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br>
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,<br>
And that our drift look through our bad performance,<br>
&#8217;Twere better not assay&#8217;d: therefore this project<br>
Should have a back or second, that might hold,<br>
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:<br>
We&#8217;ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha&#8217;t.<br>

<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br>
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;<br>
There with fantastic garlands did she come<br>
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br>
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br>
But our cold maids do dead men&#8217;s fingers call them:<br>
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br>
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br>
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br>
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br>
As one incapable of her own distress,<br>
Or like a creature native and indued<br>
Unto that element: but long it could not be<br>
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br>

spades, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
wilfully seeks her own salvation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee she is: and therefore make her
grave
straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
Christian burial.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">How can that be, unless she drowned herself in
her
own defence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis found so.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">It must be &#8216;se offendendo;&#8217; it cannot
be else. For
here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
herself wittingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Give me leave. Here lies the water; good:
here
stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
goes,&#8212;mark you that; but if the water come to him
and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">But is this law?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, is&#8217;t; crowner&#8217;s quest
law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Will you ha&#8217; the truth on&#8217;t? If this
had not been
a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o&#8217;
Christian burial.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there thou say&#8217;st: and the more pity
that
great folk should have countenance in this world to
drown or hang themselves, more than their even
Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
they hold up Adam&#8217;s profession.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Was he a gentleman?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">He was the first that ever bore arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he had none.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand
the
Scripture? The Scripture says &#8216;Adam digged:&#8217;
could he dig without arms? I&#8217;ll put another
question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
purpose, confess thyself&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Go to.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">What is he that builds stronger than either
the
mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
thousand tenants.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I like thy wit well, in good faith: the
gallows
does well; but how does it well? it does well to
those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
the gallows may do well to thee. To&#8217;t again, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Clown</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Who builds stronger than a mason, a

dull
ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
you are asked this question next, say &#8216;a
grave-maker: &#8216;the houses that he makes last till
doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
stoup of liquor.</p>

<p class="speech">In youth, when I did love, did love,<br>

To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,<br>
O, methought, there was nothing meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that
he
sings at grave-making?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Custom hath made it in him a property of
easiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throws up a skull</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing
once:
how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
Cain&#8217;s jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
now o&#8217;er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
might it not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It might, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Or of a courtier; which could say &#8216;Good
morrow,
sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?&#8217; This might
be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
such-a-one&#8217;s horse, when he meant to beg it; might it
not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, e&#8217;en so: and now my Lady Worm&#8217;s;
chapless, and
knocked about the mazzard with a sexton&#8217;s spade:
here&#8217;s fine revolution, an we had the trick to
see&#8217;t. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
but to play at loggats with &#8217;em? mine ache to think

O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>
For such a guest is meet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throws up another
skull</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s another: why may not that be the
skull of a
lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
in&#8217;s time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Not a jot more, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Is not parchment made of sheepskins?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">They are sheep and calves which seek out
assurance
in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
grave&#8217;s this, sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, a pit of clay for to be made<br>

<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest
in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">You lie out on&#8217;t, sir, and therefore it is
not
yours: for my part, I do not lie in&#8217;t, and yet it is
mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Thou dost lie in&#8217;t, to be in&#8217;t
and say it is thine:<br>
&#8217;tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou
liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a quick lie, sir; &#8217;twill away
gain, from me to
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What man dost thou dig it for?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">For no man, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What woman, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">For none, neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Who is to be buried in&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul,
she&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How absolute the knave is! we must speak by
the
card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
grave-maker?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Of all the days i&#8217; the year, I came
to&#8217;t that day
that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How long is that since?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that:
it
was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
is mad, and sent into England.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his
wits
there; or, if he do not, it&#8217;s no great matter there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twill, a not be seen in him there; there
the men
are as mad as he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How came he mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Very strangely, they say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How strangely?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, e&#8217;en with losing his wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Upon what ground?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here,
man
and boy, thirty years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How long will a man lie i&#8217; the earth ere he
rot?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, if he be not rotten before he
die&#8212;as we
have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
hold the laying in&#8212;he will last you some eight year
or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why he more than another?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade,
that
he will keep out water a great while; and your water
is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
Here&#8217;s a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
three and twenty years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Whose was it?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">A whoreson mad fellow&#8217;s it was: whose do
you think it was?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a&#8217;
poured a
flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
sir, was Yorick&#8217;s skull, the king&#8217;s jester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">This?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Clown</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en that.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Takes the skull</span></p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a
fellow
of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
Now get you to my lady&#8217;s chamber, and tell her, let
her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
me one thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>

<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en so.</p>

not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,

<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere to consider too curiously, to
consider so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither
with
modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?<br>
Imperious Caesar, dead and turn&#8217;d to clay,<br>
Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:<br>
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,<br>
Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!<br>

<p class="speech">What ceremony else?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Priest</p>
<p class="speech">Her obsequies have been as far enlarged<br>

Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?</p>

tear thyself?<br>
Woo&#8217;t drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?<br>
I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t. Dost thou come here to whine?<br>
To outface me with leaping in her grave?<br>
Be buried quick with her, and so will I:<br>
And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw<br>
Millions of acres on us, till our ground,<br>
Singeing his pate against the burning zone,<br>
Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou&#8217;lt mouth,<br>
I&#8217;ll rant as well as thou.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">This is mere madness:<br>
And thus awhile the fit will work on him;<br>
Anon, as patient as the female dove,<br>
When that her golden couplets are disclosed,<br>
His silence will sit drooping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Hear you, sir;<br>
What is the reason that you use me thus?<br>
I loved you ever: but it is no matter;<br>
Let Hercules himself do what he may,<br>
The cat will mew and dog will have his day.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A hall in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hamlet and
Horatio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">So much for this, sir: now shall you see the
other;<br>
You do remember all the circumstance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Remember it, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, in my heart there was a kind of
fighting,<br>
That would not let me sleep: methought I lay<br>
Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,<br>
And praised be rashness for it, let us know,<br>
Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,<br>
When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us<br>
There&#8217;s a divinity that shapes our ends,<br>
Rough-hew them how we will,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">That is most certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Up from my cabin,<br>
My sea-gown scarf&#8217;d about me, in the dark<br>
Groped I to find out them; had my desire.<br>
Finger&#8217;d their packet, and in fine withdrew<br>
To mine own room again; making so bold,<br>
My fears forgetting manners, to unseal<br>
Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,&#8212;<br>
O royal knavery!&#8212;an exact command,<br>
Larded with many several sorts of reasons<br>
Importing Denmark&#8217;s health and England&#8217;s too,<br>
With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,<br>
That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,<br>
No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,<br>
My head should be struck off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s the commission: read it at more
leisure.<br>
But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Being thus be-netted round with
villanies,&#8212;<br>
Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,<br>
They had begun the play&#8212;I sat me down,<br>
Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:<br>
I once did hold it, as our statists do,<br>
A baseness to write fair and labour&#8217;d much<br>
How to forget that learning, but, sir, now<br>
It did me yeoman&#8217;s service: wilt thou know<br>
The effect of what I wrote?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, good my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">An earnest conjuration from the king,<br>
As England was his faithful tributary,<br>
As love between them like the palm might flourish,<br>
As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear<br>
And stand a comma &#8217;tween their amities,<br>
And many such-like &#8216;As&#8217;es of great charge,<br>
That, on the view and knowing of these contents,<br>
Without debatement further, more or less,<br>
He should the bearers put to sudden death,<br>
Not shriving-time allow&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">How was this seal&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.<br>
I had my father&#8217;s signet in my purse,<br>
Which was the model of that Danish seal;<br>
Folded the writ up in form of the other,<br>
Subscribed it, gave&#8217;t the impression, placed it safely,<br>
The changeling never known. Now, the next day<br>
Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent<br>
Thou know&#8217;st already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go
to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, they did make love to this
employment;<br>
They are not near my conscience; their defeat<br>
Does by their own insinuation grow:<br>
&#8217;Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes<br>
Between the pass and fell incensed points<br>
Of mighty opposites.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a king is this!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Does it not, think&#8217;st thee, stand me now
upon&#8212;<br>
He that hath kill&#8217;d my king and whored my mother,<br>
Popp&#8217;d in between the election and my hopes,<br>
Thrown out his angle for my proper life,<br>
And with such cozenage&#8212;is&#8217;t not perfect conscience,<br>
To quit him with this arm? and is&#8217;t not to be
damn&#8217;d,<br>
To let this canker of our nature come<br>
In further evil?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">It must be shortly known to him from England<br>
What is the issue of the business there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">It will be short: the interim is mine;<br>
And a man&#8217;s life&#8217;s no more than to say
&#8216;One.&#8217;<br>
But I am very sorry, good Horatio,<br>
That to Laertes I forgot myself;<br>
For, by the image of my cause, I see<br>
The portraiture of his: I&#8217;ll court his favours.<br>
But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me<br>
Into a towering passion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Osric</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship is right welcome back to
Denmark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this
water-fly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Thy state is the more gracious; for &#8217;tis a
vice to
know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
the king&#8217;s mess: &#8217;tis a chough; but, as I say,
spacious in the possession of dirt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure,
I
should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; &#8217;tis for the
head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No, believe me, &#8217;tis very cold; the wind
is
northerly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for
my
complexion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Exceedingly, my lord; it is very
sultry,&#8212;as
&#8217;twere,&#8212;I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, remember&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hamlet moves him to put on
his hat</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good
faith.
Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
differences, of very soft society and great showing:
indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
continent of what part a gentleman would see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in
you;
though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
him, his umbrage, nothing more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the
gentleman
in our more rawer breath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t not possible to understand in another
tongue?<br>
You will do&#8217;t, sir, really.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What imports the nomination of this
gentleman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Of Laertes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">His purse is empty already; all&#8217;s golden
words are spent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Of him, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">I know you are not ignorant&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you
did,
it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes
is&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I dare not confess that, lest I should compare
with
him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
know himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the
imputation
laid on him by them, in his meed he&#8217;s unfellowed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s his weapon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Rapier and dagger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s two of his weapons: but, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">The king, sir, hath wagered with him six
Barbary
horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
and of very liberal conceit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What call you the carriages?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you
had done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The phrase would be more german to the matter, if
we
could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
against six French swords, their assigns, and three
liberal-conceited carriages; that&#8217;s the French bet
against the Danish. Why is this &#8216;imponed,&#8217; as you call
it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen
passes
between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
would vouchsafe the answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How if I answer &#8216;no&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in
trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please
his
majesty, &#8217;tis the breathing time of day with me; let
the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I re-deliver you e&#8217;en so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">To this effect, sir; after what flourish your
nature will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">I commend my duty to your lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Yours, yours.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Osric</span></p>
<p class="speech">He does well to commend it himself; there are
no
tongues else for&#8217;s turn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">This lapwing runs away with the shell on his
head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">He did comply with his dug, before he sucked
it.
Thus has he&#8212;and many more of the same bevy that I
know the dressy age dotes on&#8212;only got the tune of
the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
yesty collection, which carries them through and
through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Lord</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, his majesty commended him to you by
young
Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I am constant to my purpose; they follow the
king&#8217;s
pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The king and queen and all are coming down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">In happy time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The queen desires you to use some gentle
entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">She well instructs me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Lord</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">You will lose this wager, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I do not think so: since he went into France,
I
have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all&#8217;s here
about my heart: but it is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I
will
forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
fit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, we defy augury: there&#8217;s a
special
providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
&#8217;tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
leaves, what is&#8217;t to leave betimes?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Claudius, Queen
Gertrude, Laertes, Lords, Osric, and Attendants with foils, &amp;
c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from
me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">King Claudius puts
Laertes&#8217; hand into Hamlet&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your pardon, sir: I&#8217;ve done you
wrong;<br>
But pardon&#8217;t, as you are a gentleman.<br>
This presence knows,<br>
And you must needs have heard, how I am punish&#8217;d<br>
With sore distraction. What I have done,<br>
That might your nature, honour and exception<br>
Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<br>
Was&#8217;t Hamlet wrong&#8217;d Laertes? Never Hamlet:<br>
If Hamlet from himself be ta&#8217;en away,<br>
And when he&#8217;s not himself does wrong Laertes,<br>
Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<br>
Who does it, then? His madness: if&#8217;t be so,<br>
Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong&#8217;d;<br>
His madness is poor Hamlet&#8217;s enemy.<br>
Sir, in this audience,<br>
Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil<br>
Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,<br>
That I have shot mine arrow o&#8217;er the house,<br>
And hurt my brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I am satisfied in nature,<br>
Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most<br>
To my revenge: but in my terms of honour<br>
I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,<br>
Till by some elder masters, of known honour,<br>
I have a voice and precedent of peace,<br>
To keep my name ungored. But till that time,<br>
I do receive your offer&#8217;d love like love,<br>
And will not wrong it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I embrace it freely;<br>
And will this brother&#8217;s wager frankly play.<br>
Give us the foils. Come on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Come, one for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be your foil, Laertes: in mine
ignorance<br>
Your skill shall, like a star i&#8217; the darkest night,<br>
Stick fiery off indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">You mock me, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">No, by this hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin
Hamlet,<br>
You know the wager?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Very well, my lord<br>
Your grace hath laid the odds o&#8217; the weaker side.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">I do not fear it; I have seen you both:<br>
But since he is better&#8217;d, we have therefore odds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">This is too heavy, let me see another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">This likes me well. These foils have all a

<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.<br>
If Hamlet give the first or second hit,<br>
Or quit in answer of the third exchange,<br>
Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:<br>
The king shall drink to Hamlet&#8217;s better breath;<br>
And in the cup an union shall he throw,<br>
Richer than that which four successive kings<br>
In Denmark&#8217;s crown have worn. Give me the cups;<br>
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,<br>
The trumpet to the cannoneer without,<br>
The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,<br>
&#8216;Now the king dunks to Hamlet.&#8217; Come, begin:<br>
And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.</p>

<p class="speech">Nothing, neither way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Have at you now!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laertes wounds Hamlet; then
in scuffling, they change rapiers, and Hamlet wounds
Laertes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Part them; they are incensed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Queen Gertrude
falls</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Look to the queen there, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">How is&#8217;t, Laertes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe,
Osric;<br>
I am justly kill&#8217;d with mine own treachery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How does the queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">She swounds to see them bleed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, the drink, the drink,&#8212;O my dear
Hamlet,&#8212;<br>
The drink, the drink! I am poison&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O villany! Ho! let the door be lock&#8217;d:<br>
Treachery! Seek it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;<br>
No medicine in the world can do thee good;<br>
In thee there is not half an hour of life;<br>
The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,<br>
Unbated and envenom&#8217;d: the foul practise<br>
Hath turn&#8217;d itself on me lo, here I lie,<br>
Never to rise again: thy mother&#8217;s poison&#8217;d:<br>
I can no more: the king, the king&#8217;s to blame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The point!&#8212;envenom&#8217;d too!<br>
Then, venom, to thy work.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabs King
Claudius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Treason! treason!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned
Dane,<br>
Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?<br>
Follow my mother.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">King Claudius dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He is justly served;<br>
It is a poison temper&#8217;d by himself.<br>
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:<br>
Mine and my father&#8217;s death come not upon thee,<br>
Nor thine on me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.<br>
I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!<br>
You that look pale and tremble at this chance,<br>
That are but mutes or audience to this act,<br>
Had I but time&#8212;as this fell sergeant, death,<br>
Is strict in his arrest&#8212;O, I could tell you&#8212;<br>
But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;<br>
Thou livest; report me and my cause aright<br>
To the unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Never believe it:<br>
I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:<br>
Here&#8217;s yet some liquor left.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">As thou&#8217;rt a man,<br>
Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I&#8217;ll have&#8217;t.<br>
O good Horatio, what a wounded name,<br>
Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!<br>
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart<br>
Absent thee from felicity awhile,<br>
And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,<br>
To tell my story.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">March afar off, and shot
within</span></p>
<p class="speech">What warlike noise is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Osric</p>
<p class="speech">Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from
Poland,<br>
To the ambassadors of England gives<br>
This warlike volley.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">O, I die, Horatio;<br>
The potent poison quite o&#8217;er-crows my spirit:<br>
I cannot live to hear the news from England;<br>
But I do prophesy the election lights<br>
On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;<br>
So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,<br>
Which have solicited. The rest is silence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet
prince:<br>
And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!<br>
Why does the drum come hither?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">March within</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Fortinbras, the English
Ambassadors, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Fortinbras</p>
<p class="speech">Where is this sight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">What is it ye would see?<br>
If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Fortinbras</p>
<p class="speech">This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,<br>
What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,<br>
That thou so many princes at a shot<br>
So bloodily hast struck?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Ambassador</p>
<p class="speech">The sight is dismal;<br>
And our affairs from England come too late:<br>
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,<br>
To tell him his commandment is fulfill&#8217;d,<br>
That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:<br>
Where should we have our thanks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Not from his mouth,<br>
Had it the ability of life to thank you:<br>
He never gave commandment for their death.<br>
But since, so jump upon this bloody question,<br>
You from the Polack wars, and you from England,<br>
Are here arrived give order that these bodies<br>
High on a stage be placed to the view;<br>
And let me speak to the yet unknowing world<br>
How these things came about: so shall you hear<br>
Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,<br>
Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,<br>
Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,<br>
And, in this upshot, purposes mistook<br>
Fall&#8217;n on the inventors&#8217; reads: all this can I<br>
Truly deliver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Fortinbras</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Let us haste to hear it,<br>
And call the noblest to the audience.<br>
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:<br>
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,<br>
Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">Of that I shall have also cause to speak,<br>
And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;<br>
But let this same be presently perform&#8217;d,<br>
Even while men&#8217;s minds are wild; lest more mischance<br>
On plots and errors, happen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Fortinbras</p>
<p class="speech">Let four captains<br>
Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;<br>
For he was likely, had he been put on,<br>
To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,<br>
The soldiers&#8217; music and the rites of war<br>
Speak loudly for him.<br>
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this<br>
Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.<br>
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A dead march. Exeunt, bearing
off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot
off</span></p>
