<h4>Scene I. A hall in Duke Solinus&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Solinus, Aegeon,
Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall<br>
And by the doom of death end woes and all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;<br>
I am not partial to infringe our laws:<br>
The enmity and discord which of late<br>
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke<br>
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,<br>
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives<br>
Have seal&#8217;d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,<br>
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.<br>
For, since the mortal and intestine jars<br>
&#8217;Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,<br>
It hath in solemn synods been decreed<br>
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,<br>
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,<br>
If any born at Ephesus be seen<br>
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;<br>
Again: if any Syracusian born<br>
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,<br>
His goods confiscate to the duke&#8217;s dispose,<br>
Unless a thousand marks be levied,<br>
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.<br>
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,<br>
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;<br>
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Yet this my comfort: when your words are
done,<br>
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause<br>
Why thou departed&#8217;st from thy native home<br>
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">A heavier task could not have been imposed<br>
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:<br>
Yet, that the world may witness that my end<br>
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,<br>
I&#8217;ll utter what my sorrows give me leave.<br>
In Syracusa was I born, and wed<br>
Unto a woman, happy but for me,<br>
And by me, had not our hap been bad.<br>
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased<br>
By prosperous voyages I often made<br>
To Epidamnum; till my factor&#8217;s death<br>
And the great care of goods at random left<br>
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:<br>
From whom my absence was not six months old<br>
Before herself, almost at fainting under<br>
The pleasing punishment that women bear,<br>
Had made provision for her following me<br>
And soon and safe arrived where I was.<br>
There had she not been long, but she became<br>
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;<br>
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,<br>
As could not be distinguish&#8217;d but by names.<br>
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,<br>
A meaner woman was delivered<br>
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:<br>
Those,&#8212;for their parents were exceeding poor,&#8212;<br>
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.<br>
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,<br>
Made daily motions for our home return:<br>
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,<br>
We came aboard.<br>
A league from Epidamnum had we sail&#8217;d,<br>
Before the always wind-obeying deep<br>
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:<br>
But longer did we not retain much hope;<br>
For what obscured light the heavens did grant<br>
Did but convey unto our fearful minds<br>
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;<br>
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,<br>
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,<br>
Weeping before for what she saw must come,<br>
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,<br>
That mourn&#8217;d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,<br>
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.<br>
And this it was, for other means was none:<br>
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,<br>
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:<br>
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,<br>
Had fasten&#8217;d him unto a small spare mast,<br>
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;<br>
To him one of the other twins was bound,<br>
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:<br>
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,<br>
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix&#8217;d,<br>
Fasten&#8217;d ourselves at either end the mast;<br>
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,<br>
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,<br>
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;<br>
And by the benefit of his wished light,<br>
The seas wax&#8217;d calm, and we discovered<br>
Two ships from far making amain to us,<br>
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:<br>
But ere they came,&#8212;O, let me say no more!<br>
Gather the sequel by that went before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;<br>
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">O, had the gods done so, I had not now<br>
Worthily term&#8217;d them merciless to us!<br>
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,<br>
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;<br>
Which being violently borne upon,<br>
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;<br>
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,<br>
Fortune had left to both of us alike<br>
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.<br>
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened<br>
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,<br>
Was carried with more speed before the wind;<br>
And in our sight they three were taken up<br>
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.<br>
At length, another ship had seized on us;<br>
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,<br>
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck&#8217;d guests;<br>
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,<br>
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;<br>
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.<br>
Thus have you heard me sever&#8217;d from my bliss;<br>
That by misfortunes was my life prolong&#8217;d,<br>
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,<br>
Do me the favour to dilate at full<br>
What hath befall&#8217;n of them and thee till now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,<br>
At eighteen years became inquisitive<br>
After his brother: and importuned me<br>
That his attendant&#8212;so his case was like,<br>
Reft of his brother, but retain&#8217;d his name&#8212;<br>
Might bear him company in the quest of him:<br>
Whom whilst I labour&#8217;d of a love to see,<br>
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.<br>
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,<br>
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,<br>
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;<br>
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought<br>
Or that or any place that harbours men.<br>
But here must end the story of my life;<br>
And happy were I in my timely death,<br>
Could all my travels warrant me they live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Hapless Aegeon, whom the fates have
mark&#8217;d<br>
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!<br>
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,<br>
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,<br>
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,<br>
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.<br>
But, though thou art adjudged to the death<br>
And passed sentence may not be recall&#8217;d<br>
But to our honour&#8217;s great disparagement,<br>
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.<br>
Therefore, merchant, I&#8217;ll limit thee this day<br>
To seek thy life by beneficial help:<br>
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;<br>
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,<br>
And live; if no, then thou art doom&#8217;d to die.<br>
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,<br>
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The Mart.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antipholus of Syracuse,
Dromio of Syracuse, and First Merchant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,<br>
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.<br>
This very day a Syracusian merchant<br>
Is apprehended for arrival here;<br>
And not being able to buy out his life<br>
According to the statute of the town,<br>
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.<br>
There is your money that I had to keep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,<br>
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.<br>
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:<br>
Till that, I&#8217;ll view the manners of the town,<br>
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,<br>
And then return and sleep within mine inn,<br>
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.<br>
Get thee away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Many a man would take you at your word,<br>
And go indeed, having so good a mean.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,<br>
When I am dull with care and melancholy,<br>
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.<br>
What, will you walk with me about the town,<br>
And then go to my inn and dine with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,<br>
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;<br>
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o&#8217;clock,<br>
Please you, I&#8217;ll meet with you upon the mart<br>
And afterward consort you till bed-time:<br>
My present business calls me from you now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell till then: I will go lose myself<br>
And wander up and down to view the city.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I commend you to your own content.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">He that commends me to mine own content<br>
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.<br>
I to the world am like a drop of water<br>
That in the ocean seeks another drop,<br>
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,<br>
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:<br>
So I, to find a mother and a brother,<br>
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dromio of
Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the almanac of my true date.<br>
What now? how chance thou art return&#8217;d so soon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Return&#8217;d so soon! rather approach&#8217;d
too late:<br>
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,<br>
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;<br>
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:<br>
She is so hot because the meat is cold;<br>
The meat is cold because you come not home;<br>
You come not home because you have no stomach;<br>
You have no stomach having broke your fast;<br>
But we that know what &#8217;tis to fast and pray<br>
Are penitent for your default to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:<br>
Where have you left the money that I gave you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">O,&#8212;sixpence, that I had o&#8217; Wednesday
last<br>
To pay the saddler for my mistress&#8217; crupper?<br>
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I am not in a sportive humour now:<br>
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?<br>
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust<br>
So great a charge from thine own custody?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:<br>
I from my mistress come to you in post;<br>
If I return, I shall be post indeed,<br>
For she will score your fault upon my pate.<br>
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,<br>
And strike you home without a messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of
season;<br>
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.<br>
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, sir knave, have done your
foolishness,<br>
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">My charge was but to fetch you from the mart<br>
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:<br>
My mistress and her sister stays for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">In what safe place you have bestow&#8217;d my
money,<br>
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours<br>
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:<br>
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I have some marks of yours upon my pate,<br>
Some of my mistress&#8217; marks upon my shoulders,<br>
But not a thousand marks between you both.<br>
If I should pay your worship those again,<br>
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Thy mistress&#8217; marks? what mistress, slave,
hast thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Your worship&#8217;s wife, my mistress at the
Phoenix;<br>
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,<br>
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,<br>
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">What mean you, sir? for God&#8217;s sake, hold
your hands!<br>
Nay, and you will not, sir, I&#8217;ll take my heels.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my life, by some device or other<br>
The villain is o&#8217;er-raught of all my money.<br>
They say this town is full of cozenage,<br>
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,<br>
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,<br>
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,<br>
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,<br>
And many such-like liberties of sin:<br>
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.<br>
I&#8217;ll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:<br>
I greatly fear my money is not safe.</p>

That in such haste I sent to seek his master!<br>
Sure, Luciana, it is two o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>

And from the mart he&#8217;s somewhere gone to dinner.<br>
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:<br>
A man is master of his liberty:<br>
Time is their master, and, when they see time,<br>
They&#8217;ll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Why should their liberty than ours be more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Because their business still lies out o&#8217;

woe.<br>
There&#8217;s nothing situate under heaven&#8217;s eye<br>
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:<br>
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,<br>
Are their males&#8217; subjects and at their controls:<br>
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,<br>
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,<br>
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,<br>
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,<br>
Are masters to their females, and their lords:<br>
Then let your will attend on their accords.</p>

<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</p>

<p class="speech">But, were you wedded, you would bear some
sway.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Ere I learn love, I&#8217;ll practise to
obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">How if your husband start some other where?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Till he come home again, I would forbear.</p>

<p class="speech">Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;<br>
They can be meek that have no other cause.<br>
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,<br>
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;<br>
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,<br>
As much or more would we ourselves complain:<br>
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,<br>
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,<br>
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,<br>
This fool-begg&#8217;d patience in thee will be left.</p>

<p class="speech">Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his
meaning?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel
his
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems
he
hath great care to please his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Horn-mad, thou villain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I mean not cuckold-mad;<br>
But, sure, he is stark mad.<br>
When I desired him to come home to dinner,<br>
He ask&#8217;d me for a thousand marks in gold:<br>
&#8216;&#8217;Tis dinner-time,&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;My
gold!&#8217; quoth he;<br>
&#8216;Your meat doth burn,&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;My gold!&#8217;
quoth he:<br>
&#8216;Will you come home?&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;My gold!&#8217;
quoth he.<br>
&#8216;Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?&#8217;<br>
&#8216;The pig,&#8217; quoth I, &#8216;is burn&#8217;d;&#8217;
&#8216;My gold!&#8217; quoth he:<br>
&#8216;My mistress, sir&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;Hang up thy
mistress!<br>
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Quoth who?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Quoth my master:<br>
&#8216;I know,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;no house, no wife, no
mistress.&#8217;<br>
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,<br>
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;<br>
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him
home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Go back again, and be new beaten home?<br>
For God&#8217;s sake, send some other messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And he will bless that cross with other
beating:<br>
Between you I shall have a holy head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master
home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Am I so round with you as you with me,<br>
That like a football you do spurn me thus?<br>
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:<br>
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">His company must do his minions grace,<br>
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.<br>
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took<br>
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:<br>
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?<br>
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr&#8217;d,<br>
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:<br>
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?<br>
That&#8217;s not my fault: he&#8217;s master of my state:<br>
What ruins are in me that can be found,<br>
By him not ruin&#8217;d? then is he the ground<br>
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair<br>
A sunny look of his would soon repair<br>
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale<br>
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs
dispense.<br>
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,<br>
Or else what lets it but he would be here?<br>
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;<br>
Would that alone, alone he would detain,<br>
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!<br>
I see the jewel best enamelled<br>
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,<br>
That others touch, and often touching will<br>
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,<br>
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.<br>
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,<br>
I&#8217;ll weep what&#8217;s left away, and weeping die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!</p>

Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up<br>
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave<br>
Is wander&#8217;d forth, in care to seek me out<br>
By computation and mine host&#8217;s report.<br>
I could not speak with Dromio since at first<br>
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dromio of
Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now sir! is your merry humour
alter&#8217;d?<br>
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.<br>
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?<br>
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?<br>
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,<br>
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Even now, even here, not half an hour since.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I did not see you since you sent me hence,<br>
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou didst deny the gold&#8217;s
receipt,<br>
And told&#8217;st me of a mistress and a dinner;<br>
For which, I hope, thou felt&#8217;st I was displeased.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to see you in this merry vein:<br>
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the
teeth?<br>
Think&#8217;st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beating him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, sir, for God&#8217;s sake! now your jest is
earnest:<br>
Upon what bargain do you give it me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Because that I familiarly sometimes<br>
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,<br>
Your sauciness will jest upon my love<br>
And make a common of my serious hours.<br>
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,<br>
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.<br>
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,<br>
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,<br>
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering,
I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou not know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell you why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why
hath
a wherefore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why, first,&#8212;for flouting me; and then,
wherefore&#8212;<br>
For urging it the second time to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Was there ever any man thus beaten out of
season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Thank me, sir, for what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me
for nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll make you amends next, to give you
nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">In good time, sir; what&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Basting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, then &#8217;twill be dry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Lest it make you choleric and purchase me
another
dry basting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, learn to jest in good time:
there&#8217;s a
time for all things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I durst have denied that, before you were so
choleric.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">By what rule, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain
bald
pate of father Time himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no time for a man to recover his
hair that
grows bald by nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">May he not do it by fine and recovery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover
the
lost hair of another man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it
is,
so plentiful an excrement?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Because it is a blessing that he bestows on
beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why, but there&#8217;s many a man hath more hair
than wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose
his hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers
without wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he
loseth
it in a kind of jollity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">For what reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">For two; and sound ones too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, not sound, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Sure ones, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Certain ones then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Name them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">You would all this time have proved there is
no
time for all things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover
hair
lost by nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">But your reason was not substantial, why there is
no
time to recover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and
therefore
to the world&#8217;s end will have bald followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I knew &#8217;twould be a bald conclusion:<br>
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Adriana and
Luciana</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:<br>
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;<br>
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.<br>
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow<br>
That never words were music to thine ear,<br>
That never object pleasing in thine eye,<br>
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,<br>
That never meat sweet-savor&#8217;d in thy taste,<br>
Unless I spake, or look&#8217;d, or touch&#8217;d, or carved to
thee.<br>
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,<br>
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?<br>
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,<br>
That, undividable, incorporate,<br>
Am better than thy dear self&#8217;s better part.<br>
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!<br>
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall<br>
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,<br>
And take unmingled that same drop again,<br>
Without addition or diminishing,<br>
As take from me thyself and not me too.<br>
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,<br>
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious<br>
And that this body, consecrate to thee,<br>
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!<br>
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me<br>
And hurl the name of husband in my face<br>
And tear the stain&#8217;d skin off my harlot-brow<br>
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring<br>
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?<br>
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.<br>
I am possess&#8217;d with an adulterate blot;<br>
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:<br>
For if we too be one and thou play false,<br>
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,<br>
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.<br>
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;<br>
I live unstain&#8217;d, thou undishonoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:<br>
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,<br>
As strange unto your town as to your talk;<br>
Who, every word by all my wit being scann&#8217;d,<br>
Want wit in all one word to understand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, brother! how the world is changed with
you!<br>
When were you wont to use my sister thus?<br>
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">By Dromio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">By me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">By thee; and this thou didst return from him,<br>
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,<br>
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?<br>
What is the course and drift of your compact?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I, sir? I never saw her till this time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou liest; for even her very words<br>
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I never spake with her in all my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">How can she thus then call us by our names,<br>
Unless it be by inspiration.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">How ill agrees it with your gravity<br>
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,<br>
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!<br>
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,<br>
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.<br>
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:<br>
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,<br>
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,<br>
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:<br>
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,<br>
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;<br>
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion<br>
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:<br>
What, was I married to her in my dream?<br>
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?<br>
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?<br>
Until I know this sure uncertainty,<br>
I&#8217;ll entertain the offer&#8217;d fallacy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Dromio, go bid the servants spread for
dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.<br>
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!<br>
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:<br>
If we obey them not, this will ensue,<br>
They&#8217;ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Why pratest thou to thyself and answer&#8217;st
not?<br>
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I am transformed, master, am I not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I think thou art in mind, and so am I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast thine own form.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, I am an ape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">If thou art changed to aught, &#8217;tis to an
ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; she rides me and I long for
grass.<br>
&#8217;Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be<br>
But I should know her as well as she knows me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,<br>
To put the finger in the eye and weep,<br>
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.<br>
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.<br>
Husband, I&#8217;ll dine above with you to-day<br>
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.<br>
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,<br>
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.<br>
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?<br>
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?<br>
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!<br>
I&#8217;ll say as they say and persever so,<br>
And in this mist at all adventures go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, shall I be porter at the gate?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your

My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:<br>
Say that I linger&#8217;d with you at your shop<br>
To see the making of her carcanet,<br>
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.<br>
But here&#8217;s a villain that would face me down<br>
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,<br>
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,<br>
And that I did deny my wife and house.<br>
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Say what you will, sir, but I know what I
know;<br>
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:<br>
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,<br>
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.</p>

<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, so it doth appear<br>
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.<br>
I should kick, being kick&#8217;d; and, being at that pass,<br>

A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthazar</p>

<p class="speech">What art thou that keepest me out from the house
I owe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> The porter
for this time, sir, and my name
is Dromio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and
my name.
The one ne&#8217;er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
name for an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luce</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Can you tell

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>

<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Your wife,
sir knave! go get you from the door.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">If you went in pain, master, this
&#8217;knave&#8217; would go sore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we
would
fain have either.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthazar</p>
<p class="speech">In debating which was best, we shall part with
neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">There is something in the wind, that we cannot
get in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">You would say so, master, if your garments were
thin.<br>
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:<br>
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Go fetch me something: I&#8217;ll break ope the

<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>

<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">A man may break a word with you, sir, and words
are but wind,<br>
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> It seems thou

<p class="speech">Well, I&#8217;ll break in: go borrow me a
crow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?<br>
For a fish without a fin, there&#8217;s a fowl without a
feather;<br>
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we&#8217;ll pluck a crow
together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthazar</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!<br>
Herein you war against your reputation<br>
And draw within the compass of suspect<br>
The unviolated honour of your wife.<br>
Once this,&#8212;your long experience of her wisdom,<br>
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,<br>
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:<br>
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse<br>
Why at this time the doors are made against you.<br>
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,<br>
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,<br>
And about evening come yourself alone<br>
To know the reason of this strange restraint.<br>
If by strong hand you offer to break in<br>
Now in the stirring passage of the day,<br>
A vulgar comment will be made of it,<br>
And that supposed by the common rout<br>
Against your yet ungalled estimation<br>
That may with foul intrusion enter in<br>
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;<br>
For slander lives upon succession,<br>
For ever housed where it gets possession.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,<br>
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.<br>
I know a wench of excellent discourse,<br>
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:<br>
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,<br>
My wife&#8212;but, I protest, without desert&#8212;<br>
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:<br>
To her will we to dinner.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Angelo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Get you home<br>
And fetch the chain; by this I know &#8217;tis made:<br>
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;<br>
For there&#8217;s the house: that chain will I bestow&#8212;<br>
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife&#8212;<br>
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.<br>
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,<br>
I&#8217;ll knock elsewhere, to see if they&#8217;ll disdain me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll meet you at that place some hour

<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">And may it be that you have quite forgot<br>
A husband&#8217;s office? shall, Antipholus.<br>
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?<br>
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?<br>
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,<br>
Then for her wealth&#8217;s sake use her with more kindness:<br>
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;<br>
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:<br>
Let not my sister read it in your eye;<br>
Be not thy tongue thy own shame&#8217;s orator;<br>
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;<br>
Apparel vice like virtue&#8217;s harbinger;<br>
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;<br>
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;<br>
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?<br>
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?<br>
&#8217;Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed<br>
And let her read it in thy looks at board:<br>
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;<br>
Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.<br>
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,<br>
Being compact of credit, that you love us;<br>
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;<br>
We in your motion turn and you may move us.<br>
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;<br>
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:<br>
&#8217;Tis holy sport to be a little vain,<br>
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet mistress&#8212;what your name is else, I
know not,<br>
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,&#8212;<br>
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not<br>
Than our earth&#8217;s wonder, more than earth divine.<br>
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;<br>
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,<br>
Smother&#8217;d in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,<br>
The folded meaning of your words&#8217; deceit.<br>
Against my soul&#8217;s pure truth why labour you<br>
To make it wander in an unknown field?<br>
Are you a god? would you create me new?<br>
Transform me then, and to your power I&#8217;ll yield.<br>
But if that I am I, then well I know<br>
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,<br>
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe<br>
Far more, far more to you do I decline.<br>
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,<br>
To drown me in thy sister&#8217;s flood of tears:<br>
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:<br>
Spread o&#8217;er the silver waves thy golden hairs,<br>
And as a bed I&#8217;ll take them and there lie,<br>
And in that glorious supposition think<br>
He gains by death that hath such means to die:<br>
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">What, are you mad, that you do reason so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">It is a fault that springeth from your eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>

<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your
man?
am I myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art
thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I am an ass, I am a woman&#8217;s man and besides
myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What woman&#8217;s man? and how besides thyself?
besides thyself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman;
one
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What claim lays she to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to
your
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What is she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man
may
not speak of without he say &#8216;sir-reverence.&#8217; I have
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
wondrous fat marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou mean a fat marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, she&#8217;s the kitchen wench and all
grease;
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
she&#8217;ll burn a week longer than the whole world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What complexion is she of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half
so
clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
shoes in the grime of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a fault that water will mend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, &#8217;tis in grain; Noah&#8217;s flood
could not do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s her name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters,
that&#8217;s
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
hip to hip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Then she bears some breadth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No longer from head to foot than from hip to
hip:
she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
countries in her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">In what part of her body stands Ireland?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the
bogs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where Scotland?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of
the hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where France?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">In her forehead; armed and reverted, making
war
against her heir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find
no
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where Spain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her
breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where America, the Indies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, sir, upon her nose all o&#8217;er embellished
with
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude,
this
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call&#8217;d me
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
faith and my heart of steel,
She had transform&#8217;d me to a curtal dog and made
me turn i&#8217; the wheel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Go hie thee presently, post to the road:<br>
An if the wind blow any way from shore,<br>
I will not harbour in this town to-night:<br>
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,<br>
Where I will walk till thou return to me.<br>
If every one knows us and we know none,<br>
&#8217;Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>

So fly I from her that would be my wife.</p>

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s none but witches do inhabit

And therefore &#8217;tis high time that I were hence.<br>
She that doth call me husband, even my soul<br>
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,<br>
Possess&#8217;d with such a gentle sovereign grace,<br>
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,<br>
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:<br>
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,<br>
I&#8217;ll stop mine ears against the mermaid&#8217;s song.</p>

<p class="speech">I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.<br>
I thought to have ta&#8217;en you at the Porpentine:<br>
The chain unfinish&#8217;d made me stay thus long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>

<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you
have.<br>
Go home with it and please your wife withal;<br>
And soon at supper-time I&#8217;ll visit you<br>
And then receive my money for the chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>

That would refuse so fair an offer&#8217;d chain.<br>
I see a man here needs not live by shifts,<br>

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">No; bear it with you, lest I come not time
enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;<br>
Or else you may return without your money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the
chain:<br>
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,<br>
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse<br>
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.<br>
I should have chid you for not bringing it,<br>
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">The hour steals on; I pray you, sir,
dispatch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You hear how he importunes me;&#8212;the

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.<br>
Either send the chain or send me by some token.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
where&#8217;s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">My business cannot brook this dalliance.<br>
Good sir, say whether you&#8217;ll answer me or no:<br>
If not, I&#8217;ll leave him to the officer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I answer you! what should I answer you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">The money that you owe me for the chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I owe you none till I receive the chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You know I gave it you half an hour since.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">You gave me none: you wrong me much to say
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:<br>
Consider how it stands upon my credit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">I do; and charge you in the duke&#8217;s name to
obey me.</p>

Either consent to pay this sum for me<br>
Or I attach you by this officer.</p>

Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>

I would not spare my brother in this case,<br>
If he should scorn me so apparently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>

The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.<br>

One whose hard heart is button&#8217;d up with steel;<br>
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;<br>
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;<br>
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that

forsake your liberty.</p>

like a
bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob

men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a

and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
comes that the wenches say &#8216;God damn me;&#8217; that&#8217;s
as

The reason that I gather he is mad,<br>
Besides this present instance of his rage,<br>
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,<br>
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.<br>
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,<br>
On purpose shut the doors against his way.<br>
My way is now to hie home to his house,<br>

My ring away. This course I fittest choose;<br>

<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Perdie, your doors were lock&#8217;d and you shut
out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And did not she herself revile me there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn&#8217;d
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And did not I in rage depart from thence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">In verity you did; my bones bear witness,<br>
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t good to soothe him in these
contraries?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,<br>
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast suborn&#8217;d the goldsmith to arrest
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,<br>
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;<br>
But surely master, not a rag of money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Went&#8217;st not thou to her for a purse of
ducats?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">He came to me and I deliver&#8217;d it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">And I am witness with her that she did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">God and the rope-maker bear me witness<br>
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress, both man and master is
possess&#8217;d;<br>
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:<br>
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth
to-day?<br>
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And, gentle master, I received no gold;<br>
But I confess, sir, that we were lock&#8217;d out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Dissembling villain, thou speak&#8217;st false in
both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;<br>
And art confederate with a damned pack<br>
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:<br>
But with these nails I&#8217;ll pluck out these false eyes<br>
That would behold in me this shameful sport.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter three or four, and
offer to bind him. He strives</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">More company! The fiend is strong within him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,<br>
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them<br>
To make a rescue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Masters, let him go<br>
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They offer to bind Dromio of
Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?<br>
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man<br>
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">He is my prisoner: if I let him go,<br>
The debt he owes will be required of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:<br>
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,<br>
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.<br>
Good master doctor, see him safe convey&#8217;d<br>
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">O most unhappy strumpet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Master, I am here entered in bond for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good
master:
cry &#8216;The devil!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!</p>

Luciana, Officer and Courtezan</span></p>
<p class="speech">Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I know the man. What is the sum he owes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Two hundred ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Say, how grows it due?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Due for a chain your husband had of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">When as your husband all in rage to-day<br>
Came to my house and took away my ring&#8212;<br>
The ring I saw upon his finger now&#8212;<br>
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so, but I did never see it.<br>
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:<br>
I long to know the truth hereof at large.</p>

<p class="speech">She that would be your wife now ran from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from
thence:<br>
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do
us
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch.</p>

<p class="speech">I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder&#8217;d
you;<br>

Good sir, draw near to me, I&#8217;ll speak to him.<br>
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much<br>
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;<br>
And, not without some scandal to yourself,<br>
With circumstance and oaths so to deny<br>
This chain which now you wear so openly:<br>
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,<br>
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,<br>
Who, but for staying on our controversy,<br>
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:<br>
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I think I had; I never did deny it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>

I&#8217;ll prove mine honour and mine honesty<br>

<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I knew he was not in his perfect wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">How long hath this possession held the man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,<br>
And much different from the man he was;<br>
But till this afternoon his passion<br>
Ne&#8217;er brake into extremity of rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?<br>
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye<br>
Stray&#8217;d his affection in unlawful love?<br>
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,<br>
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.<br>
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">To none of these, except it be the last;<br>
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">You should for that have reprehended him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, but not rough enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">As roughly as my modesty would let me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Haply, in private.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">And in assemblies too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but not enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">It was the copy of our conference:<br>
In bed he slept not for my urging it;<br>
At board he fed not for my urging it;<br>
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;<br>
In company I often glanced it;<br>
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">And thereof came it that the man was mad.<br>
The venom clamours of a jealous woman<br>
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog&#8217;s tooth.<br>
It seems his sleeps were hinder&#8217;d by thy railing,<br>
And therefore comes it that his head is light.<br>
Thou say&#8217;st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:<br>
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;<br>
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;<br>
And what&#8217;s a fever but a fit of madness?<br>
Thou say&#8217;st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:<br>
Sweet recreation barr&#8217;d, what doth ensue<br>
But moody and dull melancholy,<br>
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,<br>
And at her heels a huge infectious troop<br>
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?<br>
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest<br>
To be disturb&#8217;d, would mad or man or beast:<br>
The consequence is then thy jealous fits<br>
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">She never reprehended him but mildly,<br>
When he demean&#8217;d himself rough, rude and wildly.<br>
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">She did betray me to my own reproof.<br>
Good people enter and lay hold on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a creature enters in my house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Then let your servants bring my husband
forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,<br>
And it shall privilege him from your hands<br>
Till I have brought him to his wits again,<br>
Or lose my labour in assaying it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I will attend my husband, be his nurse,<br>
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,<br>
And will have no attorney but myself;<br>
And therefore let me have him home with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient; for I will not let him stir<br>
Till I have used the approved means I have,<br>
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,<br>
To make of him a formal man again:<br>
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,<br>
A charitable duty of my order.<br>
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I will not hence and leave my husband here:<br>
And ill it doth beseem your holiness<br>
To separate the husband and the wife.</p>

Have won his grace to come in person hither<br>
And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</p>

Anon, I&#8217;m sure, the duke himself in person<br>

Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Upon what cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>

<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:<br>
It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">May it please your grace, Antipholus, my
husband,<br>
Whom I made lord of me and all I had,<br>
At your important letters,&#8212;this ill day<br>
A most outrageous fit of madness took him;<br>
That desperately he hurried through the street,<br>
With him his bondman, all as mad as he&#8212;<br>
Doing displeasure to the citizens<br>
By rushing in their houses, bearing thence<br>
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.<br>
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,<br>
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,<br>
That here and there his fury had committed.<br>
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,<br>
He broke from those that had the guard of him;<br>
And with his mad attendant and himself,<br>
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,<br>
Met us again and madly bent on us,<br>
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,<br>
We came again to bind them. Then they fled<br>
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:<br>
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us<br>
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,<br>
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.<br>
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command<br>
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Long since thy husband served me in my wars,<br>
And I to thee engaged a prince&#8217;s word,<br>

Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate<br>

Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor<br>
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;<br>
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him<br>
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:<br>
My master preaches patience to him and the while<br>
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,<br>
And sure, unless you send some present help,<br>
Between them they will kill the conjurer.</p>

And that is false thou dost report to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>

Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood<br>
That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.</p>

<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister<br>

As this is false he burdens me withal!</p>

night,<br>
But she tells to your highness simple truth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:<br>
In this the madman justly chargeth them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, I am advised what I say,<br>
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,<br>
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,<br>
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.<br>
This woman lock&#8217;d me out this day from dinner:<br>
That goldsmith there, were he not pack&#8217;d with her,<br>
Could witness it, for he was with me then;<br>
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,<br>
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,<br>
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.<br>
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,<br>
I went to seek him: in the street I met him<br>
And in his company that gentleman.<br>
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down<br>
That I this day of him received the chain,<br>
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which<br>
He did arrest me with an officer.<br>
I did obey, and sent my peasant home<br>
For certain ducats: he with none return&#8217;d<br>
Then fairly I bespoke the officer<br>
To go in person with me to my house.<br>
By the way we met<br>
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more<br>
Of vile confederates. Along with them<br>
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,<br>
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,<br>
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,<br>
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,<br>
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,<br>
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,<br>
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,<br>
And with no face, as &#8217;twere, outfacing me,<br>
Cries out, I was possess&#8217;d. Then all together<br>
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence<br>
And in a dark and dankish vault at home<br>
There left me and my man, both bound together;<br>
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,<br>
I gain&#8217;d my freedom, and immediately<br>
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech<br>
To give me ample satisfaction<br>
For these deep shames and great indignities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with
him,<br>
That he dined not at home, but was lock&#8217;d out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">But had he such a chain of thee or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,<br>
These people saw the chain about his neck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine<br>
Heard you confess you had the chain of him<br>
After you first forswore it on the mart:<br>
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;<br>
And then you fled into this abbey here,<br>
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I never came within these abbey-walls,<br>
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:<br>
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!<br>
And this is false you burden me withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what an intricate impeach is this!<br>
I think you all have drunk of Circe&#8217;s cup.<br>
If here you housed him, here he would have been;<br>
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:<br>
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here<br>
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he dined with her there, at the
Porpentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">He did, and from my finger snatch&#8217;d that
ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Saw&#8217;st thou him enter at the abbey
here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess
hither.<br>
I think you are all mated or stark mad.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit one to Abbess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:<br>
Haply I see a friend will save my life<br>
And pay the sum that may deliver me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Is not your name, sir, call&#8217;d
Antipholus?<br>
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Within this hour I was his bondman sir,<br>
But he, I thank him, gnaw&#8217;d in two my cords:<br>
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">I am sure you both of you remember me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;<br>
For lately we were bound, as you are now<br>
You are not Pinch&#8217;s patient, are you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Why look you strange on me? you know me well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I never saw you in my life till now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">O, grief hath changed me since you saw me
last,<br>
And careful hours with time&#8217;s deformed hand<br>
Have written strange defeatures in my face:<br>
But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Dromio, nor thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, trust me, sir, nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">I am sure thou dost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever
a
man denies, you are now bound to believe him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">Not know my voice! O time&#8217;s extremity,<br>
Hast thou so crack&#8217;d and splitted my poor tongue<br>
In seven short years, that here my only son<br>
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?<br>
Though now this grained face of mine be hid<br>
In sap-consuming winter&#8217;s drizzled snow,<br>
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,<br>
Yet hath my night of life some memory,<br>
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,<br>
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:<br>
All these old witnesses&#8212;I cannot err&#8212;<br>
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I never saw my father in my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st we parted: but perhaps, my son,<br>
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">The duke and all that know me in the city<br>
Can witness with me that it is not so<br>
I ne&#8217;er saw Syracusa in my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years<br>
Have I been patron to Antipholus,<br>
During which time he ne&#8217;er saw Syracusa:<br>
I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Aemilia, with
Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Most mighty duke, behold a man much
wrong&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">All gather to see
them</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">One of these men is Genius to the other;<br>
And so of these. Which is the natural man,<br>
And which the spirit? who deciphers them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Aegeon art thou not? or else his ghost?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">O, my old master! who hath bound him here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds<br>
And gain a husband by his liberty.<br>
Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be&#8217;st the man<br>
That hadst a wife once call&#8217;d Aemilia<br>
That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:<br>
O, if thou be&#8217;st the same Aegeon, speak,<br>
And speak unto the same Aemilia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aegeon</p>
<p class="speech">If I dream not, thou art Aemilia:<br>
If thou art she, tell me where is that son<br>
That floated with thee on the fatal raft?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">By men of Epidamnum he and I<br>
And the twin Dromio all were taken up;<br>
But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth<br>
By force took Dromio and my son from them<br>
And me they left with those of Epidamnum.<br>
What then became of them I cannot tell<br>
I to this fortune that you see me in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here begins his morning story right;<br>
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,<br>
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,&#8212;<br>
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,&#8212;<br>
These are the parents to these children,<br>
Which accidentally are met together.<br>
Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I came from Corinth, my most gracious
lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And I with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Brought to this town by that most famous
warrior,<br>
Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Which of you two did dine with me to-day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I, gentle mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">And are not you my husband?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">No; I say nay to that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">And so do I; yet did she call me so:<br>
And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,<br>
Did call me brother.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Luciana</span></p>
<p class="speech">What I told you then,<br>
I hope I shall have leisure to make good;<br>
If this be not a dream I see and hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I think it be, sir; I deny it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I think I did, sir; I deny it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,<br>
By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">No, none by me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">This purse of ducats I received from you,<br>
And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.<br>
I see we still did meet each other&#8217;s man,<br>
And I was ta&#8217;en for him, and he for me,<br>
And thereupon these errors are arose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">These ducats pawn I for my father here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">It shall not need; thy father hath his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I must have that diamond from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">There, take it; and much thanks for my good
cheer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemelia</p>
<p class="speech">Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains<br>
To go with us into the abbey here<br>
And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:<br>
And all that are assembled in this place,<br>
That by this sympathized one day&#8217;s error<br>
Have suffer&#8217;d wrong, go keep us company,<br>
And we shall make full satisfaction.<br>
Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail<br>
Of you, my sons; and till this present hour<br>
My heavy burden ne&#8217;er delivered.<br>
The duke, my husband and my children both,<br>
And you the calendars of their nativity,<br>
Go to a gossips&#8217; feast and go with me;<br>
After so long grief, such festivity!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Solinus</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart, I&#8217;ll gossip at this
feast.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Antipholus of
Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of
Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, shall I fetch your stuff from
shipboard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou
embark&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the
Centaur.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:<br>
Come, go with us; we&#8217;ll look to that anon:<br>
Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse
and Antipholus of Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">There is a fat friend at your master&#8217;s
house,<br>
That kitchen&#8217;d me for you to-day at dinner:<br>
She now shall be my sister, not my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks you are my glass, and not my
brother:<br>
I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.<br>
Will you walk in to see their gossiping?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, sir; you are my elder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a question: how shall we try it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll draw cuts for the senior: till then
lead thou first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then, thus:<br>
We came into the world like brother and brother;<br>
And now let&#8217;s go hand in hand, not one before another.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
