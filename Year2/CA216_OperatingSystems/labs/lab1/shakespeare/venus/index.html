<p>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLEY,</p>
<p>EARL OF SOUHAMPTON, AND BARON OF TICHFIELD.</p>
<p>RIGHT HONOURABLE,</p>
<p>I know not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines
to your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so
strong a prop to support so weak a burthen: only, if your honour
seem but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take
advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some
graver labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove
deformed, I shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather, and never
after ear so barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a
harvest. I leave it to your honourable survey, and your honour to
your heart&#8217;s content; which I wish may always answer your own
wish and the world&#8217;s hopeful expectation.</p>
<p>Your honour&#8217;s in all duty,</p>
<p>WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.</p>

<h3>VENUS AND ADONIS</h3>
<p>EVEN as the sun with purple-colour&#8217;d face<br>
Had ta&#8217;en his last leave of the weeping morn,<br>
Rose-cheek&#8217;d Adonis tried him to the chase;<br>
Hunting he lov&#8217;d, but love he laugh&#8217;d to scorn;
<span class="vln">4</span><br>
&#8195;Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,<br>
&#8195;And like a bold-fac&#8217;d suitor &#8216;gins to woo
him.</p>
<p>&#8216;Thrice fairer than myself,&#8217; thus she began,<br>
&#8216;The field&#8217;s chief flower, sweet above compare,
<span class="vln">8</span><br>
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,<br>
More white and red than doves or roses are;<br>
&#8195;Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,<br>
&#8195;Saith that the world hath ending with thy life. <span class=
"vln">12</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,<br>
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;<br>
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed<br>
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know: <span class=
"vln">16</span><br>
Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses;<br>
And being set, I&#8217;ll smother thee with kisses:</p>
<p>&#8216;And yet not cloy thy lips with loath&#8217;d satiety,<br>
But rather famish them amid their plenty, <span class=
"vln">20</span><br>
Making them red and pale with fresh variety;<br>
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:<br>
&#8195;A summer&#8217;s day will seem an hour but short,<br>
&#8195;Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.&#8217;
<span class="vln">24</span></p>
<p>With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,<br>
The precedent of pith and livelihood,<br>
And, trembling in her passion, calls it balm,<br>
Earth&#8217;s sovereign salve to do a goddess good: <span class=
"vln">28</span><br>
&#8195;Being so enrag&#8217;d, desire doth lend her force<br>
&#8195;Courageously to pluck him from his horse.</p>
<p>Over one arm the lusty courser&#8217;s rein<br>
Under her other was the tender boy, <span class="vln">32</span><br>
Who blush&#8217;d and pouted in a dull disdain,<br>
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;<br>
&#8195;She red and hot as coals of glowing fire<br>
&#8195;He red for shame, but frosty in desire. <span class=
"vln">36</span></p>
<p>The studded bridle on a ragged bough<br>
Nimbly she fastens;&#8212;O! how quick is love:&#8212;<br>
The steed is stalled up, and even now<br>
To tie the rider she begins to prove: <span class=
"vln">40</span><br>
&#8195;Backward she push&#8217;d him, as she would be thrust,<br>
&#8195;And govern&#8217;d him in strength, though not in lust.</p>
<p>So soon was she along, as he was down,<br>
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips: <span class=
"vln">44</span><br>
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,<br>
And &#8216;gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;<br>
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,<br>
&#8216;If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.&#8217;
<span class="vln">48</span></p>
<p>He burns with bashful shame; she with her tears<br>
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;<br>
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs<br>
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks: <span class=
"vln">52</span><br>
&#8195;He saith she is immodest, blames her miss;<br>
&#8195;What follows more she murders with a kiss.</p>
<p>Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,<br>
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone, <span class=
"vln">56</span><br>
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,<br>
Till either gorge be stuff&#8217;d or prey be gone;<br>
Even so she kiss&#8217;d his brow, his cheek, his chin,<br>
And where she ends she doth anew begin. <span class=
"vln">60</span></p>
<p>Forc&#8217;d to content, but never to obey,<br>
Panting he lies, and breatheth in her face;<br>
She feedeth on the steam, as on a prey,<br>
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace; <span class=
"vln">64</span><br>
&#8195;Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers<br>
&#8195;So they were dewd with such distilling showers.</p>
<p>Look! how a bird lies tangled in a net,<br>
So fasten&#8217;d in her arms Adonis lies; <span class=
"vln">68</span><br>
Pure shame and aw&#8217;d resistance made him fret,<br>
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:<br>
&#8195;Rain added to a river that is rank<br>
&#8195;Perforce will force it overflow the bank. <span class=
"vln">72</span></p>
<p>Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,<br>
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;<br>
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,<br>
&#8216;Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale; <span class=
"vln">76</span><br>
&#8195;Being red she loves him best; and being white,<br>
&#8195;Her best is better&#8217;d with a more delight.</p>
<p>Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;<br>
And by her fair immortal hand she swears, <span class=
"vln">80</span><br>
From his soft bosom never to remove,<br>
Till he take truce with her contending tears,<br>
&#8195;Which long have rain&#8217;d, making her cheeks all wet;<br>
&#8195;And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.</p>
<p>Upon this promise did he raise his chin <span class=
"vln">85</span><br>
Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,<br>
Who, being look&#8217;d on, ducks as quickly in;<br>
So offers he to give what she did crave; <span class=
"vln">88</span><br>
&#8195;But when her lips were ready for his pay,<br>
&#8195;He winks, and turns his lips another way.</p>
<p>Never did passenger in summer&#8217;s heat<br>
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn. <span class=
"vln">92</span><br>
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;<br>
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:<br>
&#8195;&#8216;O! pity,&#8217; &#8216;gan she cry,
&#8216;flint-hearted boy:<br>
&#8195;&#8217;Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy? <span class=
"vln">96</span></p>
<p>&#8216;I have been woo&#8217;d, as I entreat thee now,<br>
Even by the stern and direful god of war,<br>
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne&#8217;er did bow,<br>
Who conquers where he comes m every jar; <span class=
"vln">100</span><br>
&#8195;Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,<br>
&#8195;And begg&#8217;d for that which thou unask&#8217;d shalt
have.</p>
<p>&#8216;Over my altars hath he hung his lance,<br>
His batter&#8217;d shield, his uncontrolled crest, <span class=
"vln">104</span><br>
And for my sake hath learn&#8217;d to sport and dance<br>
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile, and jest;<br>
&#8195;Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red<br>
&#8195;Making my arms his field, his tent my bed. <span class=
"vln">108</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Thus he that overrul&#8217;d I oversway&#8217;d,<br>
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:<br>
Strong-temper&#8217;d steel his stronger strength obey&#8217;d,<br>
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain. <span class=
"vln">112</span><br>
&#8195;O! be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,<br>
&#8195;For mastering her that foil&#8217;d the god of fight.</p>
<p>Touch but my lips with those falr lips of thine,&#8212;<br>
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red,&#8212; <span class=
"vln">116</span><br>
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine:<br>
What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:<br>
&#8195;Look in mine eyeballs, there thy beauty lies;<br>
&#8195;Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes? <span class=
"vln">120</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Art thou asham&#8217;d to kiss? then wink again,<br>
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;<br>
Love keeps his revels where there are but twain;<br>
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight: <span class=
"vln">124</span><br>
&#8195;These blue-vein&#8217;d violets whereon we lean<br>
&#8195;Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.</p>
<p>&#8216;The tender spring upon thy tempting lip <span class=
"vln">127</span><br>
Shows thee unripe, yet mayst thou well be tasted:<br>
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;<br>
Beauty within itself should not be wasted:<br>
&#8195;Fair flowers that are not gather&#8217;d in their prime<br>
&#8195;Rot and consume themselves in little time. <span class=
"vln">132</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Were I hard-favour&#8217;d, foul, or wrinkled-old,<br>
Ill-nurtur&#8217;d, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,<br>
O&#8217;erworn, despised, rheumatic, and cold,<br>
Thick-sighted, barren, lean, and lacking juice, <span class=
"vln">136</span><br>
&#8195;Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee;<br>
&#8195;But having no defects, why dost abhor me?</p>
<p>&#8216;Thou canst not see one winkle in my brow; <span class=
"vln">139</span><br>
Mine eyes are grey and bright, and quick in turning;<br>
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow;<br>
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;<br>
&#8195;My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt.<br>
&#8195;Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt. <span class=
"vln">144</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,<br>
Or like a fairy, trip upon the green,<br>
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell&#8217;d hair,<br>
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen: <span class=
"vln">148</span><br>
&#8195;Love is a spirit all compact of fire,<br>
&#8195;Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.</p>
<p>&#8216;Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie; <span class=
"vln">151</span><br>
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;<br>
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,<br>
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:<br>
&#8195;Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be<br>
&#8195;That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee? <span class=
"vln">156</span><br>
<br>
&#8216;Is thine own heart to shine own face affected?<br>
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?<br>
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,<br>
Steal thine own freedom, and complain on theft. <span class=
"vln">160</span><br>
&#8195;Narcissus so himself himself forsook,<br>
&#8195;And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.</p>
<p>&#8216;Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,<br>
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use, <span class=
"vln">164</span><br>
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear;<br>
Things growing to themselves are growth&#8217;s abuse:<br>
&#8195;Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty breedeth beauty;<br>
&#8195;Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty. <span class=
"vln">168</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Upon the earth&#8217;s increase why shouldst thou
feed,<br>
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?<br>
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,<br>
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead; <span class=
"vln">172</span><br>
&#8195;And so in spite of death thou dost survive,<br>
&#8195;In that thy likeness still is left alive.&#8217;</p>
<p>By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,<br>
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them, <span class=
"vln">176</span><br>
And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat<br>
With burning eye did hotly overlook them,<br>
&#8195;Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,<br>
&#8195;So he were like him and by Venus&#8217; side. <span class=
"vln">180</span></p>
<p>And now Adonis with a lazy spright,<br>
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,<br>
His louring brows o&#8217;erwhelming his fair sight,<br>
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky, <span class=
"vln">184</span><br>
&#8195;Souring his cheeks, cries, &#8216;Fie! no more of love:<br>
&#8195;The sun doth burn my face; I must remove.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Ay me,&#8217; quoth Venus, &#8216;young, and so
unkind!<br>
What bare excuses mak&#8217;st thou to be gone! <span class=
"vln">188</span><br>
I&#8217;ll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind<br>
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:<br>
&#8195;I&#8217;ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs; <span class=
"vln">191</span><br>
&#8195;If they burn too, I&#8217;ll quench them with my tears.</p>
<p>&#8216;The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,<br>
And lo! I lie between that sun and thee:<br>
The heat I have from thence doth little harm,<br>
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me; <span class=
"vln">196</span><br>
&#8195;And were I not immortal, life were done<br>
&#8195;Between this heavenly and earthly sun.</p>
<p>&#8216;Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel?<br>
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth: <span class=
"vln">200</span><br>
Art thou a woman&#8217;s son, and canst not feel<br>
What &#8217;tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?<br>
&#8195;O! had thy mother borne so hard a mind, <span class=
"vln">203</span><br>
&#8195;She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.</p>
<p>&#8216;What am I that thou shouldst contemn me this?<br>
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?<br>
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?<br>
&#8195;Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:<br>
&#8195;Give me one kiss, I&#8217;ll give it thee again,
<span class="vln">209</span><br>
And one for interest if thou wilt have twain.</p>
<p>&#8216;Fie! lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,<br>
Well-painted idol, image dull and dead, <span class=
"vln">212</span><br>
Statue contenting but the eye alone,<br>
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred:<br>
&#8195;Thou art no man, though of a man&#8217;s complexion,<br>
&#8195;For men will kiss even by their own direction.&#8217;
<span class="vln">216</span></p>
<p>This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,<br>
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;<br>
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong;<br>
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause: <span class=
"vln">220</span><br>
&#8195;And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,<br>
&#8195;And now her sobs do her intendments break.</p>
<p>Sometimes she shakes her head, and then his hand;<br>
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground; <span class=
"vln">224</span><br>
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:<br>
She would, he will not in her arms be bound;<br>
&#8195;And when from thence he struggles to be gone,<br>
&#8195;She locks her lily fingers one in one. <span class=
"vln">228</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Fondling,&#8217; she saith, &#8216;since I have
hemm&#8217;d thee here<br>
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,<br>
I&#8217;ll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;<br>
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale: <span class=
"vln">232</span><br>
&#8195;Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,<br>
&#8195;Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.</p>
<p>&#8216;Within this limit is relief enough,<br>
Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain, <span class=
"vln">236</span><br>
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,<br>
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain:<br>
&#8195;Then be my deer, since I am such a park; <span class=
"vln">239</span><br>
&#8195;No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.&#8217;</p>
<p>At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,<br>
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:<br>
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,<br>
He might be buried in a tomb so simple; <span class=
"vln">244</span><br>
&#8195;Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,<br>
&#8195;Why, there Love liv&#8217;d, and there he could not die.</p>
<p>These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,<br>
Open&#8217;d their mouths to swallow Venus&#8217; liking.
<span class="vln">248</span><br>
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?<br>
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?<br>
&#8195;Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,<br>
&#8195;To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn! <span class=
"vln">252</span></p>
<p>Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?<br>
Her words are done, her woes the more increasing;<br>
The time is spent, her object will away,<br>
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing: <span class=
"vln">256</span><br>
&#8195;&#8216;Pity,&#8217; she cries; &#8216;some favour, some
remorse!&#8217;<br>
&#8195;Away he springs, and hasteth to his horse.</p>
<p>But lo! from forth a copse that neighbours by,<br>
A breeding jennet, lusty, young, and proud, <span class=
"vln">260</span><br>
Adonis&#8217; tramping courier doth espy,<br>
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:<br>
&#8195;The strong-neck&#8217;d steed, being tied unto a tree,<br>
&#8195;Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he. <span class=
"vln">264</span></p>
<p>Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,<br>
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;<br>
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,<br>
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven&#8217;s thunder;<br>
&#8195;The iron bit he crusheth &#8216;tween his teeth,
<span class="vln">269</span><br>
&#8195;Controlling what he was controlled with.</p>
<p>His ears up-prick&#8217;d; his braided hanging mane<br>
Upon his compass&#8217;d crest now stand on end; <span class=
"vln">272</span><br>
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,<br>
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:<br>
&#8195;His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,<br>
&#8195;Shows his hot courage and his high desire. <span class=
"vln">276</span></p>
<p>Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,<br>
With gentle majesty and modest pride;<br>
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,<br>
As who should say, &#8216;Lo! thus my strength is tried;<br>
&#8195;And this I do to captivate the eye <span class=
"vln">281</span><br>
&#8195;Of the fair breeder that is standing by.&#8217;</p>
<p>What recketh he his rider&#8217;s angry stir,<br>
His flattering &#8216;Holla&#8217;, or his &#8216;Stand, I
say&#8217;? <span class="vln">284</span><br>
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?<br>
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?<br>
&#8195;He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,<br>
&#8195;Nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees. <span class=
"vln">288</span></p>
<p>Look, when a painter would surpass the life,<br>
In limning out a well-proportion&#8217;d steed,<br>
His art with nature&#8217;s workmanship at strife,<br>
As if the dead the living should exceed; <span class=
"vln">292</span><br>
&#8195;So did this horse excel a common one,<br>
&#8195;In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.</p>
<p>Round-hoof&#8217;d, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,<br>
Broad breast, full eye, small head, and nostril wide,<br>
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,<br>
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:<br>
&#8195;Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,<br>
&#8195;Save a proud rider on so proud a back. <span class=
"vln">300</span></p>
<p>Sometimes he scuds far off, and there he stares;<br>
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;<br>
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,<br>
And whe&#8217;r he run or fly they know not whether; <span class=
"vln">304</span><br>
&#8195;For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,<br>
&#8195;Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather&#8217;d wings.</p>
<p>He looks upon his love, and neighs unto her;<br>
She answers him as if she knew his mind; <span class=
"vln">308</span><br>
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,<br>
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,<br>
&#8195;Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,<br>
&#8195;Beating his kind embracements with her heels. <span class=
"vln">312</span></p>
<p>Then, like a melancholy malcontent,<br>
He vails his tail, that, like a falling plume,<br>
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:<br>
He stamps, and bites the poor flies in his fume. <span class=
"vln">316</span><br>
&#8195;His love, perceiving how he is enrag&#8217;d,<br>
&#8195;Grew kinder, and his fury was assuag&#8217;d.</p>
<p>His testy master goeth about to take him;<br>
When lo! the unback&#8217;d breeder, full of fear, <span class=
"vln">320</span><br>
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,<br>
With her the horse, and left Adonis there:<br>
&#8195;As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,<br>
&#8195;Outstripping crows that strive to overfly them. <span class=
"vln">324</span></p>
<p>All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,<br>
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:<br>
And now the happy season once more fits,<br>
That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest; <span class=
"vln">328</span><br>
&#8195;For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong<br>
&#8195;When it is barr&#8217;d the aidance of the tongue.</p>
<p>An oven that is stopp&#8217;d, or river stay&#8217;d,<br>
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage: <span class=
"vln">332</span><br>
So of concealed sorrow may be said;<br>
Free vent of words love&#8217;s fire doth assuage;<br>
&#8195;But when the heart&#8217;s attorney once is mute<br>
&#8195;The client breaks, as desperate in his suit. <span class=
"vln">336</span></p>
<p>He sees her coming, and begins to glow,&#8212;<br>
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,&#8212;<br>
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;<br>
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind, <span class=
"vln">340</span><br>
&#8195;Taking no notice that she is so nigh,<br>
&#8195;For all askance he holds her in his eye.</p>
<p>O! what a sight it was, wistly to view<br>
How she came stealing to the wayward boy; <span class=
"vln">344</span><br>
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,<br>
How white and red each other did destroy:<br>
&#8195;But now her cheek was pale, and by and by<br>
&#8195;It flash&#8217;d forth fire, as lightning from the sky.
<span class="vln">348</span></p>
<p>Now was she just before him as he sat,<br>
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;<br>
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,<br>
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels: <span class=
"vln">352</span><br>
&#8195;His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand&#8217;s print,<br>
&#8195;As apt as new-fall&#8217;n snow takes any dint.</p>
<p>O! what a war of looks was then between them;<br>
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing; <span class=
"vln">356</span><br>
His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;<br>
Her eyes woo&#8217;d still, his eyes disdain&#8217;d the
wooing:<br>
&#8195;And all this dumb play had his acts made plain<br>
&#8195;With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.</p>
<p>Full gently now she takes him by the hand, <span class=
"vln">361</span><br>
A lily prison&#8217;d in a gaol of snow,<br>
Or ivory in an alabaster band;<br>
So white a friend engirts so white a foe: <span class=
"vln">364</span><br>
&#8195;This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,<br>
&#8195;Show&#8217;d like two silver doves that sit a-billing.</p>
<p>Once more the engine of her thoughts began:<br>
&#8216;O fairest mover on this mortal round, <span class=
"vln">368</span><br>
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,<br>
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;<br>
&#8195;For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,<br>
&#8195;Though nothing but my body&#8217;s bane would cure
thee.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Give me my hand,&#8217; saith he, &#8216;why dost thou
feel it?&#8217;<br>
&#8216;Give me my heart,&#8217; saith she, &#8216;and thou shalt
have it;<br>
O! give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,<br>
And being steel&#8217;d, soft sighs can never grave it:
<span class="vln">376</span><br>
&#8195;Then love&#8217;s deep groans I never shall regard,<br>
&#8195;Because Adonis&#8217; heart hath made mine hard.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;For shame,&#8217; he cries, &#8216;let go, and let me
go;<br>
My day&#8217;s delight is past, my horse is gone, <span class=
"vln">380</span><br>
And &#8217;tis your fault I am bereft him so:<br>
I pray you hence, and leave me here alone:<br>
&#8195;For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,<br>
&#8195;Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.&#8217; <span class=
"vln">384</span></p>
<p>Thus she replies: &#8216;Thy palfrey, as he should,<br>
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:<br>
Affection is a coal that must be cool&#8217;d;<br>
Else, suffer&#8217;d, it will set the heart on fire: <span class=
"vln">388</span><br>
&#8195;The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;<br>
&#8195;Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.</p>
<p>&#8216;How like a Jade he stood, tied to the tree,<br>
Servilely master&#8217;d with a leathern rein! <span class=
"vln">392</span><br>
But when he saw his love, his youth&#8217;s fair fee,<br>
He held such petty bondage in disdain;<br>
&#8195;Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,<br>
&#8195;Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast. <span class=
"vln">396</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,<br>
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,<br>
But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,<br>
His other agents aim at like delight? <span class=
"vln">400</span><br>
&#8195;Who is so faint, that dare not bo so bold<br>
&#8195;To touch the fire, the weather being cold?</p>
<p>&#8216;Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;<br>
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee, <span class=
"vln">404</span><br>
To take advantage on presented joy<br>
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee.<br>
&#8195;O learn to love, the lesson is but plain,<br>
&#8195;And once made perfect, never lost again. <span class=
"vln">408</span></p>
<p>&#8216;I know not love,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;nor will not
know it,<br>
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;<br>
&#8217;Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;<br>
My love to love is love but to disgrace it; <span class=
"vln">412</span><br>
&#8195;For I have heard it is a life in death,<br>
&#8195;That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.</p>
<p>&#8216;Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish&#8217;d?<br>
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth? <span class=
"vln">416</span><br>
If springing things be any jot diminish&#8217;d,<br>
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth;<br>
&#8195;The colt that&#8217;s back&#8217;d and burden&#8217;d being
young<br>
&#8195;Loseth his pride, and never waxeth strong. <span class=
"vln">420</span></p>
<p>&#8216;You hurt my hand with wringing Iet us part,<br>
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:<br>
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;<br>
To love&#8217;s alarms it will not ope the gate: <span class=
"vln">424</span><br>
&#8195;Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;<br>
&#8195;For where a heart is hard they make no battery.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What! canst thou talk?&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;hast thou
a tongue?<br>
O! would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing; <span class=
"vln">428</span><br>
Thy mermaid&#8217;s voice hath done me double wrong;<br>
I had my load before, now press&#8217;d with bearing:<br>
&#8195;Melodious discord, heavenly tune, harsh-sounding,<br>
&#8195;Ear&#8217;s deep-sweet music, and heart&#8217;s deep-sore
wounding.</p>
<p>&#8216;Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love <span class=
"vln">433</span><br>
That inward beauty and invisible;<br>
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move<br>
Each part in me that were but sensible: <span class=
"vln">436</span><br>
&#8195;Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,<br>
&#8195;Yet should I be in love by touching thee.</p>
<p>&#8216;Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,<br>
And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch, <span class=
"vln">440</span><br>
And nothing but the very smell were left me,<br>
Yet would my love to thee be still as much;<br>
&#8195;For from the stillitory of thy face excelling<br>
&#8195;Comes breath perfum&#8217;d that breedeth love by
smelling.</p>
<p>&#8216;But O! what banquet wert thou to the taste, <span class=
"vln">445</span><br>
Being nurse and feeder of the other four;<br>
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,<br>
And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,<br>
&#8195;Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,<br>
&#8195;Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?&#8217;
<span class="vln">448</span></p>
<p>Once more the ruby-colour&#8217;d portal open&#8217;d,<br>
Which to his speech did honey passage yield, <span class=
"vln">452</span><br>
Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken&#8217;d<br>
Wrack to the seaman, tempest to the field,<br>
&#8195;Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,<br>
&#8195;Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds. <span class=
"vln">456</span></p>
<p>This ill presage advisedly she marketh:<br>
Even as the wind is hush&#8217;d before it raineth,<br>
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,<br>
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth, <span class=
"vln">460</span><br>
&#8195;Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,<br>
&#8195;His meaning struck her ere his words begun.</p>
<p>And at his look she flatly falleth down<br>
For looks kill love, and love by looks reviveth; <span class=
"vln">464</span><br>
A smile recures the wounding of a frown;<br>
But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!<br>
&#8195;The silly boy, believing she is dead<br>
&#8195;Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;
<span class="vln">468</span></p>
<p>And all amaz&#8217;d brake off his late intent,<br>
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,<br>
Which cunning love did wittily prevent:<br>
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her! <span class=
"vln">472</span><br>
&#8195;For on the grass she lies as she were slain<br>
&#8195;Till his breath breatheth life in her again.</p>
<p>He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,<br>
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard, <span class=
"vln">476</span><br>
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks<br>
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr&#8217;d:<br>
&#8195;He kisses her; and she, by her good will,<br>
&#8195;Will never rise, so he will kiss her still. <span class=
"vln">480</span></p>
<p>The night of sorrow now is turn&#8217;d to day:<br>
Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,<br>
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array<br>
He cheers the morn, and all the world relieveth: <span class=
"vln">484</span><br>
&#8195;And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,<br>
&#8195;So is her face illumin&#8217;d with her eye;</p>
<p>Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix&#8217;d,<br>
As if from thence they borrow&#8217;d all their shine. <span class=
"vln">488</span><br>
Were never four such lamps together mix&#8217;d,<br>
Had not his clouded with his brow&#8217;s repine;<br>
&#8195;But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light<br>
&#8195;Shone like the moon in water seen by night. <span class=
"vln">492</span></p>
<p>&#8216;O! where am I?&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;in earth or
heaven,<br>
Or in the ocean drench&#8217;d, or in the fire?<br>
What hour is this? or morn or weary even?<br>
Do I delight to die, or life desire? <span class=
"vln">496</span><br>
&#8195;But now I liv&#8217;d, and life was death&#8217;s annoy;<br>
&#8195;But now I died, and death was lively joy.</p>
<p>&#8216;O! thou didst kill me; kill me once again:<br>
Thy eyes&#8217; shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
<span class="vln">500</span><br>
Hath taught them scornful tricks, and such disdain,<br>
That they have murder&#8217;d this poor heart of mine;<br>
&#8195;And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,<br>
&#8195;But for thy piteous lips no more had seen. <span class=
"vln">504</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Long may they kiss each other for this cure!<br>
O! never let their crimson liveries wear;<br>
And as they last, their verdure still endure,<br>
To drive infection from the dangerous year: <span class=
"vln">508</span><br>
&#8195;That the star-gazers, having writ on death,<br>
&#8195;May say, the plague is banish&#8217;d by thy breath.</p>
<p>&#8216;Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,<br>
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing? <span class=
"vln">512</span><br>
To sell myself I can be well contented,<br>
So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;<br>
&#8195;Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips<br>
&#8195;Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips. <span class=
"vln">516</span></p>
<p>&#8216;A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;<br>
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.<br>
What is ten hundred touches unto thee?<br>
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone? <span class=
"vln">520</span><br>
&#8195;Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,<br>
&#8195;Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;Fair queen,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;if any love you owe
me,<br>
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years: <span class=
"vln">524</span><br>
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;<br>
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:<br>
&#8195;The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,<br>
&#8195;Or being early pluck&#8217;d is sour to taste. <span class=
"vln">528</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Look! the world&#8217;s comforter, with weary gait<br>
His day&#8217;s hot task hath ended in the west;<br>
The owl, night&#8217;s herald, shrieks, &#8217;tis very late;<br>
The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest, <span class=
"vln">532</span><br>
&#8195;And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven&#8217;s light<br>
&#8195;Do summon us to part, and bid good night.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now let me say good night, and so say you;<br>
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.&#8217; <span class=
"vln">536</span><br>
&#8216;Good night,&#8217; quoth she; and ere he says adieu,<br>
The honey fee of parting tender&#8217;d is:<br>
&#8195;Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;<br>
&#8195;Incorporate then they seem, face grows to face. <span class=
"vln">540</span></p>
<p>Till, breathless, he disjoin&#8217;d, and backward drew<br>
The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,<br>
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,<br>
Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth: <span class=
"vln">544</span><br>
&#8195;He with her plenty press&#8217;d, she faint with dearth,<br>
&#8195;Their lips together glu&#8217;d, fall to the earth.</p>
<p>Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,<br>
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth; <span class=
"vln">548</span><br>
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,<br>
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;<br>
&#8195;Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,<br>
&#8195;That she will draw his lips&#8217; rich treasure dry.
<span class="vln">552</span></p>
<p>And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,<br>
With blindfold fury she begins to forage;<br>
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,<br>
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage; <span class=
"vln">556</span><br>
&#8195;Planting oblivion, beating reason back,<br>
&#8195;Forgetting shame&#8217;s pure blush and honour&#8217;s
wrack.</p>
<p>Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,<br>
Like a wild bird being tam&#8217;d with too much handling,<br>
Or as the fleet-foot roe that&#8217;s tir&#8217;d with chasing,
<span class="vln">561</span><br>
Or like the froward infant still&#8217;d with dandling,<br>
&#8195;He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,<br>
&#8195;While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.
<span class="vln">564</span></p>
<p>What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,<br>
And yields at last to every light impression?<br>
Things out of hope are compass&#8217;d oft with venturing,<br>
Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission: <span class=
"vln">568</span><br>
&#8195;Affection faints not like a pale-fac&#8217;d coward,<br>
&#8195;But then woos best when most his choice is froward.</p>
<p>When he did frown, O! had she then gave over,<br>
Such nectar from his lips she had not suck&#8217;d. <span class=
"vln">572</span><br>
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;<br>
What though the rose have prickles, yet &#8217;tis
pluck&#8217;d:<br>
&#8195;Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,<br>
&#8195;Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.</p>
<p>For pity now she can no more detain him; <span class=
"vln">577</span><br>
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:<br>
She is resolv&#8217;d no longer to restrain him,<br>
Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart, <span class=
"vln">580</span><br>
&#8195;The which, by Cupid&#8217;s bow she doth protest,<br>
&#8195;He carries thence incaged in his breast.</p>
<p>&#8216;Sweet boy,&#8217; she says, &#8216;this night I&#8217;ll
waste in sorrow,<br>
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch. <span class=
"vln">584</span><br>
Tell me, Love&#8217;s master, shall we meet to-morrow<br>
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?&#8217;<br>
&#8195;He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends<br>
&#8195;To hunt the boar with certain of his friends. <span class=
"vln">588</span></p>
<p>&#8216;The boar!&#8217; quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,<br>
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,<br>
Usurps her cheeks, she trembles at his tale,<br>
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws: <span class=
"vln">592</span><br>
&#8195;She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,<br>
&#8195;He on her belly falls, she on her back.</p>
<p>Now is she in the very lists of love,<br>
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter: <span class=
"vln">596</span><br>
All is imaginary she doth prove,<br>
He will not manage her, although he mount her;<br>
&#8195;That worse than Tantalus&#8217; is her annoy,<br>
&#8195;To clip Elysium and to lack her joy. <span class=
"vln">600</span></p>
<p>Even as poor birds, deceiv&#8217;d with painted grapes,<br>
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,<br>
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,<br>
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw. <span class=
"vln">604</span><br>
&#8195;The warm effects which she in him finds missing,<br>
&#8195;She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.</p>
<p>But all in vain, good queen, it will not be:<br>
She hath assay&#8217;d as much as may be prov&#8217;d; <span class=
"vln">608</span><br>
Her pleading hath deserv&#8217;d a greater fee;<br>
She&#8217;s Love, she loves, and yet she is not lov&#8217;d.<br>
&#8195;&#8216;Fie, fie!&#8217; he says, &#8216;you crush me; let me
go;<br>
&#8195;You have no reason to withhold me so.&#8217; <span class=
"vln">612</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Thou hadst been gone,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;sweet boy,
ere this,<br>
But that thou told&#8217;st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.<br>
O! be advis&#8217;d; thou know&#8217;st not what it is<br>
With javelin&#8217;s point a churlish swine to gore, <span class=
"vln">616</span><br>
&#8195;Whose tushes never sheath&#8217;d he whetteth still,<br>
&#8195;Like to a mortal butcher, bent to kill.</p>
<p>&#8216;On his bow-back he hath a battle set<br>
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes; <span class=
"vln">620</span><br>
His eyes like glow-worms shine when he doth fret;<br>
His snout digs sepulchres where&#8217;er he goes;<br>
&#8195;Being mov&#8217;d, he strikes whate&#8217;er is in his
way,<br>
&#8195;And whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay. <span class=
"vln">624</span></p>
<p>&#8216;His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm&#8217;d,<br>
Are better proof than thy spear&#8217;s point can enter;<br>
His short thick neck cannot be easily harm&#8217;d;<br>
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture: <span class=
"vln">628</span><br>
&#8195;The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,<br>
&#8195;As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.</p>
<p>&#8216;Alas! he nought esteems that face of thine,<br>
To which Love&#8217;s eyes pay tributary gazes; <span class=
"vln">632</span><br>
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips, and crystal eyne,<br>
Whose full perfection all the world amazes;<br>
&#8195;But having thee at vantage, wondrous dread!<br>
&#8195;Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.</p>
<p>&#8216;O! let him keep his loathsome cabin still; <span class=
"vln">637</span><br>
Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:<br>
Come not within his danger by thy will;<br>
They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.<br>
&#8195;When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,<br>
&#8195;I fear&#8217;d thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.</p>
<p>&#8216;Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?<br>
Saw&#8217;st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye? <span class=
"vln">644</span><br>
Grew I not faint? And fell I not downright?<br>
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,<br>
&#8195;My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,<br>
&#8195;But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.</p>
<p>&#8216;For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy <span class=
"vln">649</span><br>
Doth call himself Affection&#8217;s sentinel;<br>
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,<br>
And in a peaceful hour doth cry &#8220;Kill, kill!&#8221;
<span class="vln">652</span><br>
&#8195;Distempering gentle Love in his desire,<br>
&#8195;As air and water do abate the fire.</p>
<p>&#8216;This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,<br>
This canker that eats up Love&#8217;s tender spring, <span class=
"vln">656</span><br>
This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,<br>
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,<br>
&#8195;Knocks at my heart, and whispers in mine ear<br>
&#8195;That if I love thee, I thy death should fear: <span class=
"vln">660</span></p>
<p>&#8216;And more than so, presenteth to mine eye<br>
The picture of an angry-chafing boar,<br>
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie<br>
An image like thyself, all stain&#8217;d with gore; <span class=
"vln">664</span><br>
&#8195;Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed<br>
&#8195;Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.</p>
<p>&#8216;What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,<br>
That tremble at the imagination? <span class="vln">668</span><br>
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,<br>
And fear doth teach it divination:<br>
&#8195;I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,<br>
&#8195;If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow. <span class=
"vln">672</span></p>
<p>&#8216;But if thou needs wilt hunt, be rul&#8217;d by me;<br>
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,<br>
Or at the fox which lives by subtilty,<br>
Or at the roe which no encounter dare: <span class=
"vln">676</span><br>
&#8195;Pursue these fearful creatures o&#8217;er the downs,<br>
&#8195;And on thy well-breath&#8217;d horse keep with thy
hound.</p>
<p>&#8216;And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,<br>
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles <span class=
"vln">680</span><br>
How he outruns the winds, and with what care<br>
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:<br>
&#8195;The many musits through the which he goes<br>
&#8195;Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes. <span class=
"vln">684</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,<br>
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,<br>
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,<br>
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell, <span class=
"vln">688</span><br>
&#8195;And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer;<br>
&#8195;Danger deviseth shifts, wit waits on fear:</p>
<p>&#8216;For there his smell with others being mingled,
<span class="vln">691</span><br>
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,<br>
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled<br>
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;<br>
&#8195;Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,<br>
&#8195;As if another chase were in the skies. <span class=
"vln">696</span></p>
<p>&#8216;By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,<br>
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,<br>
To hearken if his foes pursue him still:<br>
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear; <span class=
"vln">700</span><br>
And now his grief may be compared well<br>
To one sore sick that hears the passing bell.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch<br>
Turn, and return, indenting with the way; <span class=
"vln">704</span><br>
Each envious briar his weary legs doth scratch,<br>
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:<br>
&#8195;For misery is trodden on by many,<br>
&#8195;And being low never reliev&#8217;d by any. <span class=
"vln">708</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Lie quietly, and hear a little more;<br>
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:<br>
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,<br>
Unlike myself thou hear&#8217;st me moralize, <span class=
"vln">712</span><br>
&#8195;Applying this to that, and so to so;<br>
&#8195;For love can comment upon every woe.</p>
<p>&#8216;Where did I leave?&#8217; &#8216;No matter where,&#8217;
quoth he<br>
&#8216;Leave me, and then the story aptly ends: <span class=
"vln">716</span><br>
The night is spent,&#8217; &#8216;Why, what of that?&#8217; quoth
she.<br>
&#8216;I am,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;expected of my friends;<br>
&#8195;And now &#8217;tis dark, and going I shall fall.&#8217;<br>
&#8195;&#8216;In night,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;desire sees best
of all.&#8217; <span class="vln">720</span></p>
<p>But if thou fall, O! then imagine this,<br>
The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,<br>
And all is but to rob thee of a kiss. <span class=
"vln">723</span><br>
Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips<br>
&#8195;Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,<br>
&#8195;Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:<br>
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine <span class=
"vln">728</span><br>
Till forging Nature be condemn&#8217;d of treason,<br>
For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;<br>
&#8195;Wherein she fram&#8217;d thee in high heaven&#8217;s
despite,<br>
&#8195;To shame the sun by day and her by night. <span class=
"vln">732</span></p>
<p>&#8216;And therefore hath she brib&#8217;d the Destinies,<br>
To cross the curious workmanship of nature<br>
To mingle beauty with infirmities,<br>
And pure perfection with impure defeature; <span class=
"vln">736</span><br>
&#8195;Making it subject to the tyranny<br>
&#8195;Of mad mischances and much misery;</p>
<p>&#8216;As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,<br>
Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood, <span class=
"vln">740</span><br>
The marrow-eating sickness, whose attains<br>
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood;<br>
&#8195;Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn&#8217;d despair,<br>
&#8195;Swear nature&#8217;s death for framing thee so fair.
<span class="vln">744</span></p>
<p>&#8216;And not the least of all these maladies<br>
But in one minute&#8217;s fight brings beauty under:<br>
Both favour, savour hue, and qualities,<br>
Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder, <span class=
"vln">748</span><br>
&#8195;Are on the sudden wasted, thaw&#8217;d and done,<br>
&#8195;As mountain-snow melts with the mid-day sun.</p>
<p>&#8216;Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,<br>
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns, <span class=
"vln">752</span><br>
That on the earth would breed a scarcity<br>
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,<br>
&#8195;Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night<br>
&#8195;Dries up his oil to lend the world his light. <span class=
"vln">756</span></p>
<p>&#8216;What is thy body but a swallowing grave,<br>
Seeming to bury that posterity<br>
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,<br>
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity? <span class=
"vln">760</span><br>
&#8195;If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,<br>
&#8195;Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.</p>
<p>&#8216;So in thyself thyself art made away;<br>
A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife, <span class=
"vln">764</span><br>
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,<br>
Or butcher-sire that reeves his son of life.<br>
&#8195;Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,<br>
&#8195;But gold that&#8217;s put to use more gold begets.&#8217;
<span class="vln">768</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Nay then,&#8217; quoth Adon, &#8216;you will fall
again<br>
Into your idle over-handled theme;<br>
The kiss I gave you is bestow&#8217;d in vain,<br>
And all in vain you strive against the stream; <span class=
"vln">772</span><br>
&#8195;For by this black-fac&#8217;d night, desire&#8217;s foul
nurse,<br>
&#8195;Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.</p>
<p>&#8216;If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,<br>
And every tongue more moving than your own, <span class=
"vln">776</span><br>
Bewitching like the wanton mermaid&#8217;s songs,<br>
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown;<br>
&#8195;For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,<br>
&#8195;And will not let a false sound enter there; <span class=
"vln">780</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Lest the deceiving harmony should run<br>
Into the quiet closure of my breast;<br>
And then my little heart were quite undone,<br>
In his bedchamber to be barr&#8217;d of rest. <span class=
"vln">784</span><br>
&#8195;No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,<br>
&#8195;But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.</p>
<p>&#8216;What have you urg&#8217;d that I cannot reprove?<br>
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger; <span class=
"vln">790</span><br>
I hate not love, but your device in love<br>
That lends embracements unto every stranger.<br>
&#8195;You do it for increase: O strange excuse!<br>
&#8195;When reason is the bawd to lust&#8217;s abuse. <span class=
"vln">792</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Call it not, love, for Love to heaven is fled,<br>
Since sweating Lust on earth usurp&#8217;d his name;<br>
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed<br>
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame; <span class=
"vln">796</span><br>
&#8195;Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,<br>
&#8195;As caterpillars do the tender leaves.</p>
<p>&#8216;Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,<br>
But Lust&#8217;s effect is tempest after sun; <span class=
"vln">800</span><br>
Love&#8217;s gentle spring doth always fresh remain,<br>
Lust&#8217;s winter comes ere summer half be done.<br>
&#8195;Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;<br>
&#8195;Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies. <span class=
"vln">804</span></p>
<p>&#8216;More I could tell, but more I dare not say;<br>
The text is old, the orator too green.<br>
Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;<br>
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen: <span class=
"vln">808</span><br>
&#8195;Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended<br>
&#8195;Do burn themselves for having so offended.&#8217;</p>
<p>With this he breaketh from the sweet embrace <span class=
"vln">811</span><br>
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,<br>
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;<br>
Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress&#8217;d.<br>
&#8195;Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky<br>
&#8195;So glides he in the night from Venus&#8217; eye;
<span class="vln">816</span></p>
<p>Which after him she darts, as one on shore<br>
Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,<br>
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,<br>
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend: <span class=
"vln">820</span><br>
&#8195;So did the merciless and pitchy night<br>
&#8195;Fold in the object that did feed her sight.</p>
<p>Whereat amaz&#8217;d, as one that unaware<br>
Hath dropp&#8217;d a precious jewel in the flood, <span class=
"vln">824</span><br>
Or &#8216;stonish&#8217;d as night-wanderers often are,<br>
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood;<br>
&#8195;Even so confounded in the dark she lay,<br>
&#8195;Having lost the fair discovery of her way. <span class=
"vln">828</span></p>
<p>And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,<br>
That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,<br>
Make verbal repetition of her moans;<br>
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled: <span class=
"vln">832</span><br>
&#8195;&#8216;Ay me!&#8217; she cries, and twenty times,
&#8216;Woe, woe!&#8217;<br>
&#8195;And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.</p>
<p>She marking them, begins a wailing note,<br>
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty; <span class=
"vln">836</span><br>
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;<br>
How love is wise in folly foolish-witty:<br>
&#8195;Her heavy anthem stili concludes in woe,<br>
&#8195;And still the choir of echoes answer so. <span class=
"vln">840</span></p>
<p>Her song was tedious, and outwore the night,<br>
For lovers&#8217; hours are long, though seeming short:<br>
If pleas&#8217;d themselves, others, they think, delight<br>
In such like circumstance, with such like sport: <span class=
"vln">844</span><br>
&#8195;Their copious stories, oftentimes begun,<br>
&#8195;End without audience, and are never done.</p>
<p>For who hath she to spend the night withal,<br>
But idle sounds resembling parasites; <span class=
"vln">848</span><br>
Like shrill-tongu&#8217;d tapsters answering every call,<br>
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?<br>
&#8195;She says, &#8220;Tis so:&#8217; they answer all, &#8220;Tis
so;&#8217;<br>
&#8195;And would say after her, if she said &#8216;No&#8217;.
<span class="vln">852</span><br>
<br>
Lo! here the gentle lark, weary of rest,<br>
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,<br>
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast<br>
The sun ariseth in his majesty; <span class="vln">856</span><br>
&#8195;Who doth the world so gloriously behold,<br>
&#8195;That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish&#8217;d gold.</p>
<p>Venus salutes him with this fair good morrow:<br>
&#8216;O thou clear god, and patron of all light, <span class=
"vln">860</span><br>
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow<br>
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,<br>
&#8195;There lives a son that suck&#8217;d an earthly mother,<br>
&#8195;May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other&#8217;</p>
<p>This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove, <span class=
"vln">865</span><br>
Musing the morning is so much o&#8217;erworn,<br>
And yet she hears no tidings of her love;<br>
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn: <span class=
"vln">868</span><br>
&#8195;Anon she hears them chant it lustily,<br>
&#8195;And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.</p>
<p>And as she runs, the bushes in the way<br>
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face, <span class=
"vln">872</span><br>
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:<br>
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,<br>
&#8195;Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,<br>
&#8195;Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake. <span class=
"vln">876</span></p>
<p>By this she hears the hounds are at a bay;<br>
Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder<br>
Wreath&#8217;d up in fatal folds just in his way,<br>
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;<br>
&#8195;Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds <span class=
"vln">881</span><br>
&#8195;Appals her senses, and her spirit confounds.</p>
<p>For now she knows it is no gentle chase,<br>
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud, <span class=
"vln">884</span><br>
Because the cry remaineth in one place,<br>
Wilere fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:<br>
&#8195;Finding their enemy to be so curst,<br>
&#8195;They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.</p>
<p>This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear, <span class=
"vln">889</span><br>
Througll which it enters to surprise her heart;<br>
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,<br>
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part;<br>
&#8195;Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,<br>
&#8195;They basely fly and dare not stay the field.</p>
<p>Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy,<br>
Till, cheering up her senses sore dismay&#8217;d, <span class=
"vln">896</span><br>
She tells them &#8217;tis a causeless fantasy,<br>
And childish error, that they are afraid;<br>
&#8195;Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:<br>
&#8195;And with that word she spied the hunted boar;</p>
<p>Whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red, <span class=
"vln">901</span><br>
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,<br>
A second fear through all her sinews spread,<br>
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither: <span class=
"vln">904</span><br>
&#8195;This way she runs, and now she will no further,<br>
&#8195;But back retires to rate the boar for murther.</p>
<p>A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways,<br>
She treads the path that she untreads again; <span class=
"vln">908</span><br>
Her more than haste is mated with delays,<br>
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,<br>
&#8195;Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting,<br>
&#8195;In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.</p>
<p>Here kennel&#8217;d in a brake she finds a hound, 9l3<br>
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,<br>
And there another licking of his wound,<br>
Gainst venom&#8217;d sores the only sovereign plaster; <span class=
"vln">916</span><br>
&#8195;And here she meets another sadly scowling,<br>
&#8195;To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.</p>
<p>When he hath ceas&#8217;d his ill-resounding noise,<br>
Another flap-mouth&#8217;d mourner, black and grim, <span class=
"vln">920</span><br>
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;<br>
Another and another answer him,<br>
&#8195;Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,<br>
&#8195;Shaking their scratch&#8217;d ears, bleeding as they go.</p>
<p>Look, how the world&#8217;s poor people are amaz&#8217;d
<span class="vln">925</span><br>
At apparitions, signs, and prodigies,<br>
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gaz&#8217;d,<br>
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies; <span class=
"vln">928</span><br>
&#8195;So she at these sad sighs draws up her breath,<br>
&#8195;And, sighing it again, exclaims on Death.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hard-favour&#8217;d tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,
<span class="vln">931</span><br>
Hateful divorce of love,&#8217;&#8212;thus chides she
Death,&#8212;<br>
&#8216;Grim-grinning ghost, earth&#8217;s worm, what dost thou
mean<br>
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,<br>
&#8195;Who when he liv&#8217;d, his breath and beauty set<br>
&#8195;Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet? <span class=
"vln">936</span></p>
<p>&#8216;If he be dead, O no! it cannot be,<br>
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it;<br>
O yes! it may; thou hast no eyes to see,<br>
But hatefully at random dost thou hit. <span class=
"vln">940</span><br>
&#8195;Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart<br>
&#8195;Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p>&#8216;Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,<br>
And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power. <span class=
"vln">944</span><br>
The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;<br>
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck&#8217;st a flower.<br>
&#8195;Love&#8217;s golden arrow at him shoull have fled,<br>
&#8195;And not Death&#8217;s ebon dart, to strike him dead.
<span class="vln">948</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Dost thou drink tears, that thou provok&#8217;st such
weeping?<br>
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?<br>
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping<br>
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see? <span class=
"vln">952</span><br>
&#8195;Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour<br>
&#8195;Since her best work is ruin&#8217;d with thy
rigour.&#8217;</p>
<p>Here overcome, as one full of despair,<br>
She vail&#8217;d her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopp&#8217;d
<span class="vln">956</span><br>
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair<br>
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropp&#8217;d<br>
&#8195;But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,<br>
&#8195;And with his strong course opens them again. <span class=
"vln">960</span></p>
<p>O! how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow;<br>
Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;<br>
Both crystals, where they view&#8217;d each other&#8217;s
sorrow,<br>
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry; <span class=
"vln">964</span><br>
&#8195;But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,<br>
&#8195;Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.</p>
<p>Variable passions throng her constant woe,<br>
As striving who should best become her grief; <span class=
"vln">968</span><br>
All entertain&#8217;d, each passion labours so,<br>
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,<br>
But none is best; then join they all together,<br>
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather. <span class=
"vln">972</span></p>
<p>By this, far off she hears some huntsman holloa;<br>
A nurse&#8217;s song no&#8217;er pleas&#8217;d her babe so
well:<br>
The dire imagination she did follow<br>
This sound of hope doth labour to expel; <span class=
"vln">976</span><br>
&#8195;For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,<br>
&#8195;And flatters her it is Adonis&#8217; voice.</p>
<p>Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,<br>
Being prison&#8217;d in her eye, like pearls in glass; <span class=
"vln">980</span><br>
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,<br>
Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass<br>
&#8195;To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,<br>
&#8195;Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown&#8217;d.</p>
<p>O hard-believing love! how strange it seems <span class=
"vln">985</span><br>
Not to believe, and yet too credulous;<br>
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;<br>
Despair and hope make thee ridiculous: <span class=
"vln">988</span><br>
&#8195;The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,<br>
&#8195;In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.</p>
<p>Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought,<br>
Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame; <span class=
"vln">992</span><br>
It was not she that call&#8217;d him all to naught,<br>
Now she adds honours to his hateful name;<br>
&#8195;She clepes him king of graves, and grave for kings,<br>
&#8195;Imperious supreme of all mortal things. <span class=
"vln">996</span></p>
<p>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;sweet Death, I did but
jest;<br>
Yet pardon me, I felt a kind of fear<br>
Whenas I met the boar, that bloody beast,<br>
Which knows no pity, but is still severe; <span class=
"vln">1000</span><br>
&#8195;Then, gentle shadow,&#8212;truth I must confess&#8212;<br>
&#8195;I rail&#8217;d on thee, fearing my love&#8217;s decease.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tis not my fault: the boar provok&#8217;d my tongue;<br>
Be wreak&#8217;d on him, invisible commander; <span class=
"vln">1004</span><br>
&#8217;Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;<br>
I did but act, he &#8216;s author of my slander:<br>
&#8195;Grief hath two tongues: and never woman yet,<br>
&#8195;Could rule them both without ten women&#8217;s
wit.&#8217;</p>
<p>Thus hoping that Adonis is alive, <span class=
"vln">1009</span><br>
Her rash suspect sile doth extenuate;<br>
And that his beauty may the better thrive,<br>
With Death she humbly doth insinuate; <span class=
"vln">1012</span><br>
&#8195;Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs; and stories<br>
&#8195;His victories, his triumphs, and his glories.</p>
<p>&#8216;O Jove!&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;how much a fool was
I,<br>
To be of such a weak and silly mind <span class=
"vln">1016</span><br>
To wail his death who lives and must not die<br>
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind;<br>
&#8195;For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,<br>
&#8195;And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again. <span class=
"vln">1020</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Fie, fie, fond love! thou art so full of fear<br>
As one with treasure laden, hemm&#8217;d with thieves<br>
Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,<br>
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.&#8217; <span class=
"vln">1024</span><br>
&#8195;Even at this word she hears a merry horn<br>
&#8195;Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.</p>
<p>As falcon to the lure, away she flies;<br>
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light; <span class=
"vln">1028</span><br>
And in her haste unfortunately spies<br>
The foul boar&#8217;s conquest on her fair delight;<br>
&#8195;Which seen, her eyes, as murder&#8217;d with the view,<br>
&#8195;Like stars asham&#8217;d of day, themselves withdrew:</p>
<p>Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit, <span class=
"vln">1033</span><br>
Shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain,<br>
And there, all smother&#8217;d up, in shade doth sit,<br>
Long after fearing to creep forth again; <span class=
"vln">1036</span><br>
&#8195;So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled<br>
&#8195;Into the deep dark cabills of her head;</p>
<p>Where they resign their office and their light<br>
To the disposing of her troubled brain; <span class=
"vln">1040</span><br>
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,<br>
And never wound the heart with looks again;<br>
&#8195;Who, like a king perplexed in his throne,<br>
&#8195;By their suggestion gives a deadly groan, <span class=
"vln">1044</span></p>
<p>Whereat each tributary subject quakes;<br>
As when the wind, imprison&#8217;d in the ground,<br>
Struggling for passage, earth&#8217;s foundation shakes,<br>
Which with cold terror doth men&#8217;s minds confound.<br>
&#8195;This mutiny each part doth so surprise l049<br>
&#8195;That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;</p>
<p>And, being open&#8217;d, threw unwilling light<br>
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench&#8217;d<br>
In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white <span class=
"vln">1053</span><br>
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench&#8217;d:<br>
&#8195;No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed<br>
&#8195;But stole his blood and seem&#8217;d with him to bleed.</p>
<p>This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth, <span class=
"vln">1057</span><br>
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head,<br>
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;<br>
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead: <span class=
"vln">1060</span><br>
&#8195;Her voice is stopp&#8217;d, her joints forget to bow,<br>
&#8195;Her eyes are mad that they have wept till now.</p>
<p>Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,<br>
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;<br>
And then she reprehends her mangling eye, <span class=
"vln">1065</span><br>
That makes more gashes where no breach should be:<br>
&#8195;His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;<br>
&#8195;For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.</p>
<p>&#8216;My tongue cannot express my grief for one, <span class=
"vln">1069</span><br>
And yet,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;behold two Adons dead!<br>
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,<br>
Mine eyes are turn&#8217;d to fire, my heart to lead: <span class=
"vln">1072</span><br>
&#8195;Heavy heart&#8217;s lead, melt at mine eyes&#8217; red
fire!<br>
&#8195;So shall I die by drops of hot desire.</p>
<p>&#8216;Alas! poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!<br>
What face remains alive that&#8217;s worth the viewing?<br>
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast<br>
Of things long since, or anything ensuing? <span class=
"vln">1078</span><br>
&#8195;The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;<br>
&#8195;But true-sweet beauty liv&#8217;d and died with him.</p>
<p>&#8216;Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear! <span class=
"vln">1081</span><br>
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:<br>
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;<br>
The sun doth scorn you, and the wind doth hiss you:<br>
&#8195;But when Adonis liv&#8217;d, sun and sharp air <span class=
"vln">1085</span><br>
&#8195;Lurk&#8217;d like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:</p>
<p>&#8216;And therefore would he put his bonnet on,<br>
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep; <span class=
"vln">1088</span><br>
The wind would blow it off, and, being gone,<br>
Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;<br>
&#8195;And straight, in pity of his tender years,<br>
&#8195;They both would strive who first should dry his tears.</p>
<p>&#8216;To see his face the lion walk&#8217;d along <span class=
"vln">1093</span><br>
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;<br>
To recreate himself when he hath sung,<br>
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him; <span class=
"vln">1096</span><br>
&#8195;If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey,<br>
&#8195;And never fright the silly lamb that day.</p>
<p>&#8216;When he beheld his shadow in the brook,<br>
The fishes spread on it their golden gills; <span class=
"vln">1100</span><br>
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,<br>
That some would sing, some other in their bills<br>
&#8195;Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries<br>
&#8195;He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.</p>
<p>&#8216;But this foul, grim, and urchin-spouted boar,
<span class="vln">1105</span><br>
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,<br>
Ne&#8217;er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;<br>
Witness the entertainment that he gave: <span class=
"vln">1108</span><br>
&#8195;If he did see his face, why then I know<br>
&#8195;He thought to kiss him, and hath killed him so.</p>
<p>&#8216;&#8217;Tis true, &#8217;tis true; thus was Adonis
slain:<br>
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear, <span class=
"vln">1112</span><br>
Who did not whet his teeth at him again,<br>
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;<br>
&#8195;And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine<br>
&#8195;Sheath&#8217;d unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
<span class="vln">1116</span></p>
<p>&#8216;Had I been tooth&#8217;d like him, I must confess,<br>
With kissing him I should have kill&#8217;d him first;<br>
But he is dead, and never did he bless<br>
My youth with his; the more am I accurst.&#8217; <span class=
"vln">1120</span><br>
&#8195;With this she falleth in the place she stood,<br>
&#8195;And stains her face with his congealed blood.</p>
<p>Sho looks upon his lips, and they are pale;<br>
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold; <span class=
"vln">1124</span><br>
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,<br>
As if they heard the woeful words she told;<br>
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,<br>
Where, lo! two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;</p>
<p>Two glasses where herself herself beheld <span class=
"vln">1129</span><br>
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;<br>
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell&#8217;d,<br>
And every beauty robb&#8217;d of his effect: <span class=
"vln">1132</span><br>
&#8195;&#8216;Wonder of time,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;this is my
spite,<br>
&#8195;That, you being dead, the day should yet be light.</p>
<p>&#8216;Since thou art dead, lo! here I prophesy,<br>
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend: <span class=
"vln">1136</span><br>
It shall be waited on with jealousy,<br>
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end;<br>
&#8195;Ne&#8217;er settled equally, but high or low;<br>
&#8195;That all love&#8217;s pleasure shall not match his woe.</p>
<p>&#8216;It shall be fickle, false, and full of fraud,
<span class="vln">1141</span><br>
Bud and be blastod in a breathing-while;<br>
The bottom poison, and the top o&#8217;erstraw&#8217;d<br>
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile: <span class=
"vln">1144</span><br>
&#8195;The strongest body shall it make most weak,<br>
&#8195;Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.</p>
<p>&#8216;It shall be sparing and too full of riot,<br>
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures; <span class=
"vln">1148</span><br>
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,<br>
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;<br>
&#8195;It shall be raging mad, and silly mild,<br>
&#8195;Make the young old, the old become a child. <span class=
"vln">1152</span></p>
<p>&#8216;It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;<br>
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;<br>
It shall be merciful, and too severe,<br>
And most deceiving when it seems most just; <span class=
"vln">1156</span><br>
&#8195;Perverse it shall be, where it shows most toward,<br>
&#8195;Put fear to velour, courage to the coward.</p>
<p>&#8216;It shall be cause of war and dire events,<br>
And set dissension &#8216;twixt the son and sire; <span class=
"vln">1160</span><br>
Subject and servile to all discontents,<br>
As dry combustious matter is to fire:<br>
&#8195;Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,<br>
&#8195;They that love best their love shall not enjoy.&#8217;
<span class="vln">1164</span></p>
<p>By this, the boy that by her side lay kill&#8217;d<br>
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,<br>
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill&#8217;d,<br>
A purple flower sprung up, chequer&#8217;d with white; <span class=
"vln">1168</span><br>
&#8195;Resembling well his pale cheeks, and the blood<br>
&#8195;Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.</p>
<p>She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,<br>
Comparing it to her Adonis&#8217; breath; <span class=
"vln">1172</span><br>
And says within her bosom it shall dwell,<br>
Since he himself is reft from her by death:<br>
&#8195;She drops the stalk, and in the breach appears<br>
&#8195;Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.</p>
<p>&#8216;Poor flower,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;this was thy
father&#8217;s guise,<br>
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire,<br>
For every little grief to wet his eyes:<br>
To grow unto himself was his desire, <span class=
"vln">1180</span><br>
&#8195;And so &#8217;tis shine; but know, it is as good<br>
&#8195;To wither in my breast as in his blood.</p>
<p>&#8216;Here was thy father&#8217;s bed, here in my breast;<br>
Thou art the next of blood, and &#8217;tis thy right: <span class=
"vln">1184</span><br>
Lo! in this hollow cradle take thy rest,<br>
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:<br>
&#8195;There shall not be one minute in an hour<br>
&#8195;Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love&#8217;s
flower.&#8217;</p>
<p>Thus weary of the world, away she hies, <span class=
"vln">1189</span><br>
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid<br>
Their mistress, mounted, through the empty skies<br>
In her light chariot quickly is convey&#8217;d; <span class=
"vln">1192</span><br>
&#8195;Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen<br>
&#8195;Means to immure herself and not be seen.</p>
