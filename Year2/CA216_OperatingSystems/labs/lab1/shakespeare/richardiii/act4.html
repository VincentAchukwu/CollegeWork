<h4>Scene I. Before the Tower.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, on one side, Queen
Elizabeth, Duchess Of York, and Dorset; on the other, Anne, Duchess
of Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet, Clarence&#8217;s
young Daughter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Who m eets us here? my niece Plantagenet<br>
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?<br>
Now, for my life, she&#8217;s wandering to the Tower,<br>
On pure heart&#8217;s love to greet the tender princes.<br>
Daughter, well met.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">God give your graces both<br>
A happy and a joyful time of day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">As much to you, good sister! Whither away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,<br>
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,<br>
To gratulate the gentle princes there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Kind sister, thanks: we&#8217;ll enter all
together.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.<br>
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,<br>
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Right well, dear madam. By your patience,<br>
I may not suffer you to visit them;<br>
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The king! why, who&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The Lord protect him from that kingly title!<br>
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?<br>
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I am their fathers mother; I will see them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:<br>
Then bring me to their sights; I&#8217;ll bear thy blame<br>
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:<br>
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lord Stanley</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,<br>
And I&#8217;ll salute your grace of York as mother,<br>
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lady Anne</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, madam, you must straight to
Westminster,<br>
There to be crowned Richard&#8217;s royal queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart<br>
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon<br>
With this dead-killing news!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your
grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!<br>
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;<br>
Thy mother&#8217;s name is ominous to children.<br>
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,<br>
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell<br>
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,<br>
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;<br>
And make me die the thrall of Margaret&#8217;s curse,<br>
Nor mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s counted queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Full of wise care is this your counsel,
madam.<br>
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;<br>
You shall have letters from me to my son<br>
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.<br>
Be not ta&#8217;en tardy by unwise delay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">O ill-dispersing wind of misery!<br>
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!<br>
A cockatrice hast thou hatch&#8217;d to the world,<br>
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And I in all unwillingness will go.<br>
I would to God that the inclusive verge<br>
Of golden metal that must round my brow<br>
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!<br>
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,<br>
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory<br>
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">No! why? When he that is my husband now<br>
Came to me, as I follow&#8217;d Henry&#8217;s corse,<br>
When scarce the blood was well wash&#8217;d from his hands<br>
Which issued from my other angel husband<br>
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow&#8217;d;<br>
O, when, I say, I look&#8217;d on Richard&#8217;s face,<br>
This was my wish: &#8216;Be thou,&#8217; quoth I, &#8216;accursed,<br>
For making me, so young, so old a widow!<br>
And, when thou wed&#8217;st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;<br>
And be thy wife&#8212;if any be so mad&#8212;<br>
As miserable by the life of thee<br>
As thou hast made me by my dear lord&#8217;s death!<br>
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,<br>
Even in so short a space, my woman&#8217;s heart<br>
Grossly grew captive to his honey words<br>
And proved the subject of my own soul&#8217;s curse,<br>
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;<br>
For never yet one hour in his bed<br>
Have I enjoy&#8217;d the golden dew of sleep,<br>
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.<br>
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;<br>
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of
it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Dorset]</span><br>
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lady Anne</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard
thee!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Queen Elizabeth</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess
thee!<br>
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!<br>
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,<br>
And each hour&#8217;s joy wrecked with a week of teen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.<br>
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes<br>
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!<br>
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!<br>
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow<br>
For tender princes, use my babies well!<br>
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.</p>

III, in pomp, crowned; Buckingham, Catesby, a page, and

<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious sovereign?</p>

Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Still live they and for ever may they last!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,<br>
To try if thou be current gold indeed<br>
Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Say on, my loving lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! am I king? &#8217;tis so: but Edward
lives.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">O bitter consequence,<br>
That Edward still should live! &#8216;True, noble
prince!&#8217;<br>
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:<br>
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;<br>
And I would have it suddenly perform&#8217;d.<br>
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Your grace may do your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness

Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?</p>

Gold were as good as twenty orators,<br>

That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:<br>
I will take order for her keeping close.<br>
Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,<br>
Whom I will marry straight to Clarence&#8217; daughter:<br>
The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.<br>
Look, how thou dream&#8217;st! I say again, give out<br>
That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:<br>
About it; for it stands me much upon,<br>
To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speech">I must be married to my brother&#8217;s
daughter,<br>

<p class="speech">Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,<br>
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep&#8217;s disturbers<br>

Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.</p>

The late demand that you did sound me in.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to
Richmond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">I hear that news, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Stanley, he is your wife&#8217;s son well, look
to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I claim your gift, my due by
promise,<br>
For which your honour and your faith is pawn&#8217;d;<br>
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables<br>
The which you promised I should possess.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey<br>
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">What says your highness to my just demand?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">As I remember, Henry the Sixth<br>
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,<br>
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.<br>
A king, perhaps, perhaps,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">How chance the prophet could not at that time<br>
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, your promise for the earldom,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,<br>
The mayor in courtesy show&#8217;d me the castle,<br>
And call&#8217;d it Rougemont: at which name I started,<br>
Because a bard of Ireland told me once<br>
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>

<p class="speech">I am thus bold to put your grace in mind<br>
Of what you promised me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Well, but what&#8217;s o&#8217;clock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Upon the stroke of ten.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let it strike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Why let it strike?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Because that, like a Jack, thou keep&#8217;st the
stroke<br>
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.<br>
I am not in the giving vein to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, tut,<br>
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.</p>

<p class="speech">The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.<br>
The most arch of piteous massacre<br>
That ever yet this land was guilty of.<br>
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn<br>
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,<br>
Although they were flesh&#8217;d villains, bloody dogs,<br>
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion<br>
Wept like two children in their deaths&#8217; sad stories.<br>
&#8216;Lo, thus&#8217; quoth Dighton, &#8216;lay those tender
babes:&#8217;<br>
&#8216;Thus, thus,&#8217; quoth Forrest, &#8216;girdling one
another<br>
Within their innocent alabaster arms:<br>
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,<br>
Which in their summer beauty kiss&#8217;d each other.<br>
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;<br>
Which once,&#8217; quoth Forrest, &#8216;almost changed my
mind;<br>
But O! the devil&#8217;&#8212;there the villain stopp&#8217;d<br>
Whilst Dighton thus told on: &#8216;We smothered<br>
The most replenished sweet work of nature,<br>
That from the prime creation e&#8217;er she framed.&#8217;<br>

A dire induction am I witness to,<br>
And will to France, hoping the consequence<br>
Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.<br>
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Elizabeth and the
Duchess Of York</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!<br>
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!<br>
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air<br>
And be not fix&#8217;d in doom perpetual,<br>
Hover about me with your airy wings<br>
And hear your mother&#8217;s lamentation!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Hover about her; say, that right for right<br>
Hath dimm&#8217;d your infant morn to aged night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">So many miseries have crazed my voice,<br>
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,<br>
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.<br>
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,<br>
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?<br>
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living
ghost,<br>
Woe&#8217;s scene, world&#8217;s shame, grave&#8217;s due by life
usurp&#8217;d,<br>
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,<br>
Rest thy unrest on England&#8217;s lawful earth,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sitting down</span></p>
<p class="speech">Unlawfully made drunk with innocents&#8217;
blood!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave<br>
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!<br>
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.<br>
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sitting down by
her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">If ancient sorrow be most reverend,<br>
Give mine the benefit of seniory,<br>
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.<br>
If sorrow can admit society,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sitting down with
them</span></p>
<p class="speech">Tell o&#8217;er your woes again by viewing
mine:<br>
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him;<br>
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him:<br>
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill&#8217;d him;<br>
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;<br>
I had a Rutland too, thou holp&#8217;st to kill him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard
kill&#8217;d him.<br>
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept<br>
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:<br>
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,<br>
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,<br>
That foul defacer of God&#8217;s handiwork,<br>
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,<br>
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,<br>
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.<br>
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,<br>
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur<br>
Preys on the issue of his mother&#8217;s body,<br>
And makes her pew-fellow with others&#8217; moan!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">O Harry&#8217;s wife, triumph not in my woes!<br>
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,<br>
And now I cloy me with beholding it.<br>
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb&#8217;d my Edward:<br>
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;<br>
Young York he is but boot, because both they<br>
Match not the high perfection of my loss:<br>
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill&#8217;d my Edward;<br>
And the beholders of this tragic play,<br>
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,<br>
Untimely smother&#8217;d in their dusky graves.<br>
Richard yet lives, hell&#8217;s black intelligencer,<br>
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls<br>
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,<br>
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:<br>
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.<br>
To have him suddenly convey&#8217;d away.<br>
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,<br>
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou didst prophesy the time would come<br>
That I should wish for thee to help me curse<br>
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back&#8217;d toad!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I call&#8217;d thee then vain flourish of my
fortune;<br>
I call&#8217;d thee then poor shadow, painted queen;<br>
The presentation of but what I was;<br>
The flattering index of a direful pageant;<br>
One heaved a-high, to be hurl&#8217;d down below;<br>
A mother only mock&#8217;d with two sweet babes;<br>
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,<br>
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,<br>
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,<br>
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.<br>
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?<br>
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?<br>
Who sues to thee and cries &#8216;God save the queen&#8217;?<br>
Where be the bending peers that flatter&#8217;d thee?<br>
Where be the thronging troops that follow&#8217;d thee?<br>
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:<br>
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;<br>
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;<br>
For queen, a very caitiff crown&#8217;d with care;<br>
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;<br>
For one that scorn&#8217;d at me, now scorn&#8217;d of me;<br>
For one being fear&#8217;d of all, now fearing one;<br>
For one commanding all, obey&#8217;d of none.<br>
Thus hath the course of justice wheel&#8217;d about,<br>
And left thee but a very prey to time;<br>
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,<br>
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.<br>
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not<br>
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?<br>
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen&#8217;d yoke;<br>
From which even here I slip my weary neck,<br>
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.<br>
Farewell, York&#8217;s wife, and queen of sad mischance:<br>
These English woes will make me smile in France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O thou well skill&#8217;d in curses, stay
awhile,<br>
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
days;<br>
Compare dead happiness with living woe;<br>
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,<br>
And he that slew them fouler than he is:<br>
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:<br>
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My words are dull; O, quicken them with
thine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>

Airy succeeders of intestate joys,<br>
Poor breathing orators of miseries!<br>
Let them have scope: though what they do impart<br>
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.<br>
And in the breath of bitter words let&#8217;s smother<br>
My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother&#8217;d.<br>

From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Hidest thou that forehead with a golden
crown,<br>
Where should be graven, if that right were right,<br>
The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,<br>
And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?<br>
Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Alarums</span></p>
<p class="speech">Either be patient, and entreat me fair,<br>
Or with the clamorous report of war<br>
Thus will I drown your exclamations.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Then patiently hear my impatience.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I have a touch of your condition,<br>
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me speak!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do then: but I&#8217;ll not
hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I will be mild and gentle in my speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou so hasty? I have stay&#8217;d for
thee,<br>
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">And came I not at last to comfort you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">No, by the holy rood, thou know&#8217;st it well,<br>
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.<br>
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;<br>
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;<br>
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,<br>
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,<br>
Thy age confirm&#8217;d, proud, subdued, bloody, treacherous,<br>
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:<br>
What comfortable hour canst thou name,<br>
That ever graced me in thy company?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that
call&#8217;d
your grace<br>
To breakfast once forth of my company.<br>
If I be so disgracious in your sight,<br>
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.<br>

For I shall never speak to thee again.</p>

ordinance,<br>
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,<br>
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish<br>
And never look upon thy face again.<br>
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;<br>
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more<br>
Than all the complete armour that thou wear&#8217;st!<br>
My prayers on the adverse party fight;<br>
And there the little souls of Edward&#8217;s children<br>
Whisper the spirits of thine enemies<br>
And promise them success and victory.<br>
Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;<br>
Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.</p>

<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to
curse<br>
Abides in me; I say amen to all.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">I have no more sons of the royal blood<br>
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,<br>
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;<br>
And therefore level not to hit their lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">You have a daughter call&#8217;d Elizabeth,<br>
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And must she die for this? O, let her live,<br>
And I&#8217;ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;<br>
Slander myself as false to Edward&#8217;s bed;<br>
Throw over her the veil of infamy:<br>
So she may live unscarr&#8217;d of bleeding slaughter,<br>
I will confess she was not Edward&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">To save her life, I&#8217;ll say she is not
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Her life is only safest in her birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And only in that safety died her brothers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">True, when avoided grace makes destiny:<br>
My babes were destined to a fairer death,<br>
If grace had bless&#8217;d thee with a fairer life.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
cozen&#8217;d<br>
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.<br>
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,<br>
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:<br>
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt<br>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,<br>
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.<br>
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,<br>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys<br>
Till that my nails were anchor&#8217;d in thine eyes;<br>
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,<br>
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,<br>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise<br>
And dangerous success of bloody wars,<br>
As I intend more good to you and yours,<br>
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What good is cover&#8217;d with the face of
heaven,<br>
To be discover&#8217;d, that can do me good?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">The advancement of your children, gentle
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
heads?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">No, to the dignity and height of honour<br>
The high imperial type of this earth&#8217;s glory.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Flatter my sorrows with report of it;<br>
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,<br>
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,<br>
Will I withal endow a child of thine;<br>
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul<br>
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs<br>
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Be brief, lest that be process of thy
kindness<br>
Last longer telling than thy kindness&#8217; date.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then know, that from my soul I love thy
daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter&#8217;s mother thinks it with her
soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">What do you think?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That thou dost love my daughter from thy
soul:<br>
So from thy soul&#8217;s love didst thou love her brothers;<br>
And from my heart&#8217;s love I do thank thee for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:<br>
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,<br>
And mean to make her queen of England.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her
king?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Even he that makes her queen who should be
else?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What, thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">I, even I: what think you of it, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou woo her?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">That would I learn of you,<br>
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And wilt thou learn of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Send to her, by the man that slew her
brothers,<br>
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave<br>
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:<br>
Therefore present to her&#8212;as sometime Margaret<br>
Did to thy father, steep&#8217;d in Rutland&#8217;s
blood,&#8212;<br>
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain<br>
The purple sap from her sweet brother&#8217;s body<br>
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.<br>
If this inducement force her not to love,<br>
Send her a story of thy noble acts;<br>
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,<br>
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,<br>
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way<br>
To win our daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">There is no other way<br>
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,<br>
And not be Richard that hath done all this.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say that I did all this for love of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate
thee,<br>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what is done cannot be now amended:<br>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,<br>
Which after hours give leisure to repent.<br>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<br>
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.<br>
If I have kill&#8217;d the issue of your womb,<br>
To quicken your increase, I will beget<br>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter<br>
A grandam&#8217;s name is little less in love<br>
Than is the doting title of a mother;<br>
They are as children but one step below,<br>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;<br>
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans<br>
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.<br>
Your children were vexation to your youth,<br>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.<br>
The loss you have is but a son being king,<br>
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.<br>
I cannot make you what amends I would,<br>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.<br>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul<br>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,<br>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home<br>
To high promotions and great dignity:<br>
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.<br>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;<br>
Again shall you be mother to a king,<br>
And all the ruins of distressful times<br>
Repair&#8217;d with double riches of content.<br>
What! we have many goodly days to see:<br>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<br>
Shall come again, transform&#8217;d to orient pearl,<br>
Advantaging their loan with interest<br>
Of ten times double gain of happiness.<br>
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go<br>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;<br>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer&#8217;s tale<br>
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame<br>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess<br>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys<br>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised<br>
The petty rebel, dull-brain&#8217;d Buckingham,<br>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come<br>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror&#8217;s bed;<br>
To whom I will retail my conquest won,<br>
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar&#8217;s Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What were I best to say? her father&#8217;s
brother<br>
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?<br>
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?<br>
Under what title shall I woo for thee,<br>
That God, the law, my honour and her love,<br>
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Infer fair England&#8217;s peace by this
alliance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Which she shall purchase with still lasting
war.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say that the king, which may command,
entreats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That at her hands which the king&#8217;s King
forbids.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">To wail the tide, as her mother doth.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, I will love her everlastingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But how long shall that title &#8216;ever&#8217;
last?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Sweetly in force unto her fair life&#8217;s
end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">So long as hell and Richard likes of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But she, your subject, loathes such
sovereignty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Be eloquent in my behalf to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">An honest tale speeds best being plainly
told.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;<br>
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings
break.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my George, my garter, and my
crown,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Profaned, dishonour&#8217;d, and the third
usurp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">I swear&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By nothing; for this is no
oath:<br>
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;<br>
The garter, blemish&#8217;d, pawn&#8217;d his knightly virtue;<br>
The crown, usurp&#8217;d, disgraced his kingly glory.<br>
If something thou wilt swear to be believed,<br>
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the world&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis full of thy foul wrongs.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">My father&#8217;s death&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Thy life hath that dishonour&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then, by myself&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thyself thyself misusest.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, by God&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;God&#8217;s wrong is most of
all.<br>
If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by Him,<br>
The unity the king thy brother made<br>
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:<br>
If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by Him,<br>
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,<br>
Had graced the tender temples of my child,<br>
And both the princes had been breathing here,<br>
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,<br>
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.<br>
What canst thou swear by now?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">The time to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That thou hast wronged in the time
o&#8217;erpast;<br>
For I myself have many tears to wash<br>
Hereafter time, for time past wrong&#8217;d by thee.<br>
The children live, whose parents thou hast
slaughter&#8217;d,<br>
Ungovern&#8217;d youth, to wail it in their age;<br>
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher&#8217;d,<br>
Old wither&#8217;d plants, to wail it with their age.<br>
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast<br>
Misused ere used, by time misused o&#8217;erpast.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">As I intend to prosper and repent,<br>
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt<br>
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!<br>
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!<br>
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!<br>
Be opposite all planets of good luck<br>
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart&#8217;s love,<br>
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,<br>
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!<br>
In her consists my happiness and thine;<br>
Without her, follows to this land and me,<br>
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,<br>
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:<br>
It cannot be avoided but by this;<br>
It will not be avoided but by this.<br>
Therefore, good mother,&#8212;I must can you so&#8212;<br>
Be the attorney of my love to her:<br>
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;<br>
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:<br>
Urge the necessity and state of times,<br>
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I forget myself to be myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if yourself&#8217;s remembrance wrong
yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But thou didst kill my children.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">But in your daughter&#8217;s womb I bury
them:<br>
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed<br>
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">And be a happy mother by the deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">I go. Write to me very shortly.<br>
And you shall understand from me her mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Bear her my true love&#8217;s kiss; and so,
farewell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious sovereign, on the western coast<br>
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore<br>
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,<br>
Unarm&#8217;d, and unresolved to beat them back:<br>
&#8217;Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;<br>
And there they hull, expecting but the aid<br>
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of
Norfolk:<br>
Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Here, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Fly to the duke:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Ratcliff</span></p>
<p class="speech">Post thou to Salisbury<br>
When thou comest thither&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speech">Dull, unmindful villain,<br>
Why stand&#8217;st thou still, and go&#8217;st not to the duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">First, mighty sovereign, let me know your
mind,<br>
What from your grace I shall deliver to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight<br>
The greatest strength and power he can make,<br>
And meet me presently at Salisbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">I go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>

shall do at<br>
Salisbury?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ratcliff</p>
<p class="speech">Your highness told me I should post before.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Stanley</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, what news with you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">None good, my lord, to please you with the
hearing;<br>
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!<br>
Why dost thou run so many mile about,<br>
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?<br>
Once more, what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Richmond is on the seas.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">There let him sink, and be the seas on him!<br>
White-liver&#8217;d runagate, what doth he there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Stirr&#8217;d up by Dorset, Buckingham, and
Ely,<br>
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Is the chair empty? is the sword
unsway&#8217;d?<br>
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess&#8217;d?<br>
What heir of York is there alive but we?<br>
And who is England&#8217;s king but great York&#8217;s heir?<br>
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Unless for that he comes to be your liege,<br>
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.<br>
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?<br>
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?<br>
Are they not now upon the western shore.<br>
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord, my friends are in the
north.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the
north,<br>
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">They have not been commanded, mighty
sovereign:<br>
Please it your majesty to give me leave,<br>
I&#8217;ll muster up my friends, and meet your grace<br>
Where and what time your majesty shall please.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with
Richmond:<br>
I will not trust you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">Most mighty sovereign,<br>
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:<br>
I never was nor never will be false.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Well,<br>
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind<br>
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.<br>
Or else his head&#8217;s assurance is but frail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>

Buckingham&#8217;s army is dispersed and scatter&#8217;d;<br>

Reward to him that brings the traitor in?</p>

Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks<br>
If they were his assistants, yea or no;<br>
Who answer&#8217;d him, they came from Buckingham.<br>
Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,<br>
Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">March on, march on, since we are up in arms;<br>
If not to fight with foreign enemies,<br>
Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.</p>
