<h4>Scene I. Belmont. Avenue to Portia&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lorenzo and
Jessica</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">The moon shines bright: in such a night as
this,<br>
When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees<br>
And they did make no noise, in such a night<br>
Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls<br>
And sigh&#8217;d his soul toward the Grecian tents,<br>
Where Cressid lay that night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">In such a night<br>
Did Thisbe fearfully o&#8217;ertrip the dew<br>
And saw the lion&#8217;s shadow ere himself<br>
And ran dismay&#8217;d away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">In such a night<br>
Stood Dido with a willow in her hand<br>
Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love<br>
To come again to Carthage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">In such a night<br>
Medea gather&#8217;d the enchanted herbs<br>
That did renew old Aeson.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">In such a night<br>
Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew<br>
And with an unthrift love did run from Venice<br>
As far as Belmont.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In such a night<br>
Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,<br>
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith<br>
And ne&#8217;er a true one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">In such a night<br>
Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,<br>
Slander her love, and he forgave it her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">I would out-night you, did no body come;<br>
But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Stephano</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Who comes so fast in silence of the night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">A friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you,
friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Stephano is my name; and I bring word<br>
My mistress will before the break of day<br>
Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about<br>
By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays<br>
For happy wedlock hours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Who comes with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">None but a holy hermit and her maid.<br>
I pray you, is my master yet return&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">He is not, nor we have not heard from him.<br>
But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,<br>
And ceremoniously let us prepare<br>
Some welcome for the mistress of the house.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Launcelot</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launcelot</p>
<p class="speech">Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Who calls?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launcelot</p>
<p class="speech">Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?<br>
Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Leave hollaing, man: here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launcelot</p>
<p class="speech">Sola! where? where?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launcelot</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him there&#8217;s a post come from my
master, with
his horn full of good news: my master will be here
ere morning.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet soul, let&#8217;s in, and there expect
their coming.<br>
And yet no matter: why should we go in?<br>
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,<br>
Within the house, your mistress is at hand;<br>
And bring your music forth into the air.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Stephano</span></p>
<p class="speech">How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this
bank!<br>
Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br>
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night<br>
Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br>
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<br>
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:<br>
There&#8217;s not the smallest orb which thou behold&#8217;st<br>
But in his motion like an angel sings,<br>
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<br>
Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br>
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Musicians</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!<br>
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress&#8217; ear,<br>
And draw her home with music.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">The reason is, your spirits are attentive:<br>
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br>
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>
Which is the hot condition of their blood;<br>
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>
Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>
Their savage eyes turn&#8217;d to a modest gaze<br>
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<br>
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<br>
But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>
The man that hath no music in himself,<br>
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br>
The motions of his spirit are dull as night<br>
And his affections dark as Erebus:<br>
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Portia and
Nerissa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">That light we see is burning in my hall.<br>
How far that little candle throws his beams!<br>
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">When the moon shone, we did not see the
candle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">So doth the greater glory dim the less:<br>
A substitute shines brightly as a king<br>
Unto the king be by, and then his state<br>
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook<br>
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">It is your music, madam, of the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing is good, I see, without respect:<br>
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,<br>
When neither is attended, and I think<br>
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,<br>
When every goose is cackling, would be thought<br>
No better a musician than the wren.<br>
How many things by season season&#8217;d are<br>
To their right praise and true perfection!<br>
Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion<br>
And would not be awaked.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music ceases</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">That is the voice,<br>
Or I am much deceived, of Portia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">He knows me as the blind man knows the
cuckoo,<br>
By the bad voice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Dear lady, welcome home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">We have been praying for our husbands&#8217;
healths,<br>
Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.<br>
Are they return&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Madam, they are not yet;<br>
But there is come a messenger before,<br>
To signify their coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Go in, Nerissa;<br>
Give order to my servants that they take<br>
No note at all of our being absent hence;<br>
Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A tucket sounds</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:<br>
We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">This night methinks is but the daylight sick;<br>
It looks a little paler: &#8217;tis a day,<br>
Such as the day is when the sun is hid.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bassanio, Antonio,
Gratiano, and their followers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">We should hold day with the Antipodes,<br>
If you would walk in absence of the sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Let me give light, but let me not be light;<br>
For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,<br>
And never be Bassanio so for me:<br>
But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my
friend.<br>
This is the man, this is Antonio,<br>
To whom I am so infinitely bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You should in all sense be much bound to him.<br>
For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">No more than I am well acquitted of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you are very welcome to our house:<br>
It must appear in other ways than words,<br>
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Nerissa]</span> By yonder
moon I swear you do me wrong;<br>
In faith, I gave it to the judge&#8217;s clerk:<br>
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<br>
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">A quarrel, ho, already! what&#8217;s the
matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<br>
That she did give me, whose posy was<br>
For all the world like cutler&#8217;s poetry<br>
Upon a knife, &#8216;Love me, and leave me not.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">What talk you of the posy or the value?<br>
You swore to me, when I did give it you,<br>
That you would wear it till your hour of death<br>
And that it should lie with you in your grave:<br>
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br>
You should have been respective and have kept it.<br>
Gave it a judge&#8217;s clerk! no, God&#8217;s my judge,<br>
The clerk will ne&#8217;er wear hair on&#8217;s face that had
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">He will, an if he live to be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<br>
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<br>
No higher than thyself; the judge&#8217;s clerk,<br>
A prating boy, that begg&#8217;d it as a fee:<br>
I could not for my heart deny it him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You were to blame, I must be plain with you,<br>
To part so slightly with your wife&#8217;s first gift:<br>
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger<br>
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br>
I gave my love a ring and made him swear<br>
Never to part with it; and here he stands;<br>
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<br>
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth<br>
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br>
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:<br>
An &#8217;twere to me, I should be mad at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Why, I were
best to cut my left hand off<br>
And swear I lost the ring defending it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br>
Unto the judge that begg&#8217;d it and indeed<br>
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,<br>
That took some pains in writing, he begg&#8217;d mine;<br>
And neither man nor master would take aught<br>
But the two rings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">What ring gave you my lord?<br>
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br>
I would deny it; but you see my finger<br>
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Even so void is your false heart of truth.<br>
By heaven, I will ne&#8217;er come in your bed<br>
Until I see the ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I in yours<br>
Till I again see mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Portia,<br>
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>
If you did know for whom I gave the ring<br>
And would conceive for what I gave the ring<br>
And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>
When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br>
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>
Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br>
You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>
What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>
If you had pleased to have defended it<br>
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<br>
I&#8217;ll die for&#8217;t but some woman had the ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br>
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<br>
And begg&#8217;d the ring; the which I did deny him<br>
And suffer&#8217;d him to go displeased away;<br>
Even he that did uphold the very life<br>
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>
I was enforced to send it after him;<br>
I was beset with shame and courtesy;<br>
My honour would not let ingratitude<br>
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br>
For, by these blessed candles of the night,<br>
Had you been there, I think you would have begg&#8217;d<br>
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Let not that doctor e&#8217;er come near my
house:<br>
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<br>
And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br>
I will become as liberal as you;<br>
I&#8217;ll not deny him any thing I have,<br>
No, not my body nor my husband&#8217;s bed:<br>
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:<br>
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:<br>
If you do not, if I be left alone,<br>
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,<br>
I&#8217;ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">And I his clerk; therefore be well advised<br>
How you do leave me to mine own protection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;<br>
For if I do, I&#8217;ll mar the young clerk&#8217;s pen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome
notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;<br>
And, in the hearing of these many friends,<br>
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br>
Wherein I see myself&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Mark you but that!<br>
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;<br>
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,<br>
And there&#8217;s an oath of credit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but hear me:<br>
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<br>
I never more will break an oath with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I once did lend my body for his wealth;<br>
Which, but for him that had your husband&#8217;s ring,<br>
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,<br>
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br>
Will never more break faith advisedly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this<br>
And bid him keep it better than the other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;<br>
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;<br>
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor&#8217;s clerk,<br>
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is like the mending of highways<br>
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:<br>
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:<br>
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;<br>
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:<br>
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<br>
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here<br>
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you<br>
And even but now return&#8217;d; I have not yet<br>
Enter&#8217;d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;<br>
And I have better news in store for you<br>
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;<br>
There you shall find three of your argosies<br>
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:<br>
You shall not know by what strange accident<br>
I chanced on this letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am dumb.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Were you the clerk that is to make me
cuckold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<br>
Unless he live until he be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:<br>
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lady, you have given me life and
living;<br>
For here I read for certain that my ships<br>
Are safely come to road.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Lorenzo!<br>
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and I&#8217;ll give them him without a
fee.<br>
There do I give to you and Jessica,<br>
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<br>
After his death, of all he dies possess&#8217;d of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<br>
Of starved people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It is almost morning,<br>
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br>
Of these events at full. Let us go in;<br>
And charge us there upon inter&#8217;gatories,<br>
And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so: the first inter&#8217;gatory<br>
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,<br>
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<br>
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:<br>
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,<br>
That I were couching with the doctor&#8217;s clerk.<br>
Well, while I live I&#8217;ll fear no other thing<br>
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa&#8217;s ring.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
