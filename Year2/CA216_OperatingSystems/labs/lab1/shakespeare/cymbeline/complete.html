<h4>Scene I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two
Gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods<br>
No more obey the heavens than our courtiers<br>
Still seem as does the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">But what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">His daughter, and the heir of&#8217;s kingdom,
whom<br>
He purposed to his wife&#8217;s sole son&#8212;a widow<br>
That late he married&#8212;hath referr&#8217;d herself<br>
Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she&#8217;s wedded;<br>
Her husband banish&#8217;d; she imprison&#8217;d: all<br>
Is outward sorrow; though I think the king<br>
Be touch&#8217;d at very heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">None but the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,<br>
That most desired the match; but not a courtier,<br>
Although they wear their faces to the bent<br>
Of the king&#8217;s look&#8217;s, hath a heart that is not<br>
Glad at the thing they scowl at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">And why so?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">He that hath miss&#8217;d the princess is a
thing<br>
Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her&#8212;<br>
I mean, that married her, alack, good man!<br>
And therefore banish&#8217;d&#8212;is a creature such<br>
As, to seek through the regions of the earth<br>
For one his like, there would be something failing<br>
In him that should compare. I do not think<br>
So fair an outward and such stuff within<br>
Endows a man but he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">You speak him far.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I do extend him, sir, within himself,<br>
Crush him together rather than unfold<br>
His measure duly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What&#8217;s his name and
birth?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot delve him to the root: his father<br>
Was call&#8217;d Sicilius, who did join his honour<br>
Against the Romans with Cassibelan,<br>
But had his titles by Tenantius whom<br>
He served with glory and admired success,<br>
So gain&#8217;d the sur-addition Leonatus;<br>
And had, besides this gentleman in question,<br>
Two other sons, who in the wars o&#8217; the time<br>
Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,<br>
Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow<br>
That he quit being, and his gentle lady,<br>
Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased<br>
As he was born. The king he takes the babe<br>
To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,<br>
Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,<br>
Puts to him all the learnings that his time<br>
Could make him the receiver of; which he took,<br>
As we do air, fast as &#8217;twas minister&#8217;d,<br>
And in&#8217;s spring became a harvest, lived in court&#8212;<br>
Which rare it is to do&#8212;most praised, most loved,<br>
A sample to the youngest, to the more mature<br>
A glass that feated them, and to the graver<br>
A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,<br>
For whom he now is banish&#8217;d, her own price<br>
Proclaims how she esteem&#8217;d him and his virtue;<br>
By her election may be truly read<br>
What kind of man he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I honour him<br>
Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,<br>
Is she sole child to the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">His only child.<br>
He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,<br>
Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,<br>
I&#8217; the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery<br>
Were stol&#8217;n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge<br>
Which way they went.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">How long is this ago?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Some twenty years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">That a king&#8217;s children should be so
convey&#8217;d,<br>
So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,<br>
That could not trace them!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Howsoe&#8217;er &#8217;tis strange,<br>
Or that the negligence may well be laugh&#8217;d at,<br>
Yet is it true, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I do well believe you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,<br>
The queen, and princess.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Queen, Posthumus
Leonatus, and Imogen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">No, be assured you shall not find me,
daughter,<br>
After the slander of most stepmothers,<br>
Evil-eyed unto you: you&#8217;re my prisoner, but<br>
Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys<br>
That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,<br>
So soon as I can win the offended king,<br>
I will be known your advocate: marry, yet<br>
The fire of rage is in him, and &#8217;twere good<br>
You lean&#8217;d unto his sentence with what patience<br>
Your wisdom may inform you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Please your highness,<br>
I will from hence to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">You know the peril.<br>
I&#8217;ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying<br>
The pangs of barr&#8217;d affections, though the king<br>
Hath charged you should not speak together.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">O<br>
Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant<br>
Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,<br>
I something fear my father&#8217;s wrath; but nothing&#8212;<br>
Always reserved my holy duty&#8212;what<br>
His rage can do on me: you must be gone;<br>
And I shall here abide the hourly shot<br>
Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,<br>
But that there is this jewel in the world<br>
That I may see again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">My queen! my mistress!<br>
O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause<br>
To be suspected of more tenderness<br>
Than doth become a man. I will remain<br>
The loyal&#8217;st husband that did e&#8217;er plight troth:<br>
My residence in Rome at one Philario&#8217;s,<br>
Who to my father was a friend, to me<br>
Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,<br>
And with mine eyes I&#8217;ll drink the words you send,<br>
Though ink be made of gall.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Queen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Be brief, I pray you:<br>
If the king come, I shall incur I know not<br>
How much of his displeasure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yet I&#8217;ll move him<br>
To walk this way: I never do him wrong,<br>
But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;<br>
Pays dear for my offences.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Should we be taking leave<br>
As long a term as yet we have to live,<br>
The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, stay a little:<br>
Were you but riding forth to air yourself,<br>
Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;<br>
This diamond was my mother&#8217;s: take it, heart;<br>
But keep it till you woo another wife,<br>
When Imogen is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">How, how! another?<br>
You gentle gods, give me but this I have,<br>
And sear up my embracements from a next<br>
With bonds of death!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Putting on the
ring</span></p>
<p class="speech">Remain, remain thou here<br>
While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,<br>
As I my poor self did exchange for you,<br>
To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles<br>
I still win of you: for my sake wear this;<br>
It is a manacle of love; I&#8217;ll place it<br>
Upon this fairest prisoner.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Putting a bracelet upon her
arm</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">O the gods!<br>
When shall we see again?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cymbeline and
Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, the king!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my
sight!<br>
If after this command thou fraught the court<br>
With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!<br>
Thou&#8217;rt poison to my blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">The gods protect you!<br>
And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;There cannot be a pinch in
death<br>
More sharp than this is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O disloyal thing,<br>
That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap&#8217;st<br>
A year&#8217;s age on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, sir,<br>
Harm not yourself with your vexation<br>
I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare<br>
Subdues all pangs, all fears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Past grace? obedience?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Past hope, and in despair; that way, past
grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">That mightst have had the sole son of my
queen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,<br>
And did avoid a puttock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou took&#8217;st a beggar; wouldst have made my
throne<br>
A seat for baseness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No; I rather added<br>
A lustre to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O thou vile one!</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:<br>
You bred him as my playfellow, and he is<br>
A man worth any woman, overbuys me<br>
Almost the sum he pays.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were<br>
A neat-herd&#8217;s daughter, and my Leonatus<br>
Our neighbour shepherd&#8217;s son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou foolish thing!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Queen</span></p>
<p class="speech">They were again together: you have done<br>
Not after our command. Away with her,<br>
And pen her up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Beseech your patience. Peace,<br>
Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,<br>
Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort<br>
Out of your best advice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let her languish<br>
A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,<br>
Die of this folly!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Cymbeline and
Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fie! you must give way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pisanio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here is your servant. How now, sir! What
news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord your son drew on my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Ha!<br>
No harm, I trust, is done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">There might have been,<br>
But that my master rather play&#8217;d than fought<br>
And had no help of anger: they were parted<br>
By gentlemen at hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">I am very glad on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Your son&#8217;s my father&#8217;s friend; he
takes his part.<br>
To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!<br>
I would they were in Afric both together;<br>
Myself by with a needle, that I might prick<br>
The goer-back. Why came you from your master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">On his command: he would not suffer me<br>
To bring him to the haven; left these notes<br>
Of what commands I should be subject to,<br>
When &#8217;t pleased you to employ me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">This hath been<br>
Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour<br>
He will remain so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I humbly thank your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, walk awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;About some half-hour hence,<br>
I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least<br>
Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cloten and two
Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
violence of action hath made you reek as a
sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
there&#8217;s none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I
hurt him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> No,
&#8217;faith; not so much as his patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Hurt him! his body&#8217;s a passable carcass, if
he be
not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> His steel was
in debt; it went o&#8217; the
backside the town.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">The villain would not stand me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> No; but he
fled forward still, toward your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Stand you! You have land enough of your own:
but
he added to your having; gave you some ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> As many inches
as you have oceans. Puppies!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">I would they had not come between us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> So would I,
till you had measured how long
a fool you were upon the ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">And that she should love this fellow and refuse
me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If it be a sin
to make a true election, she
is damned.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her
brain
go not together: she&#8217;s a good sign, but I have seen
small reflection of her wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>

<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I would thou grew&#8217;st unto the shores

And question&#8217;dst every sail: if he should write<br>
And not have it, &#8217;twere a paper lost,<br>
As offer&#8217;d mercy is. What was the last<br>
That he spake to thee?</p>

<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>

As he could make me with this eye or ear<br>
Distinguish him from others, he did keep<br>
The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,<br>
Still waving, as the fits and stirs of &#8217;s mind<br>
Could best express how slow his soul sail&#8217;d on,<br>
How swift his ship.</p>

crack&#8217;d them, but<br>
To look upon him, till the diminution<br>
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,<br>
Nay, follow&#8217;d him, till he had melted from<br>
The smallness of a gnat to air, and then<br>
Have turn&#8217;d mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,<br>

<p class="speech">Be assured, madam,<br>
With his next vantage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>

Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him<br>
How I would think on him at certain hours<br>
Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear<br>
The shes of Italy should not betray<br>
Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,<br>
At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,<br>
To encounter me with orisons, for then<br>
I am in heaven for him; or ere I could<br>
Give him that parting kiss which I had set<br>
Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father<br>

<h4>Scene IV. Rome. Philario&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Philario, Iachimo, a
Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he
was
then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
could then have looked on him without the help of
admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">You speak of him when he was less furnished than
now
he is with that which makes him both without and within.</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">I have seen him in France: we had very many
there
could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">This matter of marrying his king&#8217;s
daughter, wherein
he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">And then his banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and the approbation of those that weep
this
lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
acquaintance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">His father and I were soldiers together; to whom
I
have been often bound for no less than my life.
Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
knowing, to a stranger of his quality.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Posthumus
Leonatus</span></p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you all, be better known to this
gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, we have known together in Orleans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Since when I have been debtor to you for
courtesies,
which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you o&#8217;er-rate my poor kindness: I was
glad I
did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
you should have been put together with so mortal a
purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
slight and trivial a nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">By your pardon, sir, I was then a young
traveller;
rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
my every action to be guided by others&#8217; experiences:
but upon my mended judgment&#8212;if I offend not to say
it is mended&#8212;my quarrel was not altogether slight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement
of swords,
and by such two that would by all likelihood have
confounded one the other, or have fallen both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Can we, with manners, ask what was the
difference?</p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">Safely, I think: &#8217;twas a contention in
public,
which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
It was much like an argument that fell out last
night, where each of us fell in praise of our
country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
vouching&#8212;and upon warrant of bloody
affirmation&#8212;his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
than any the rarest of our ladies in France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">That lady is not now living, or this
gentleman&#8217;s
opinion by this worn out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">She holds her virtue still and I my mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">You must not so far prefer her &#8217;fore ours
of Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Being so far provoked as I was in France, I
would
abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
adorer, not her friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">As fair and as good&#8212;a kind of
hand-in-hand
comparison&#8212;had been something too fair and too good
for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
excelled many: but I have not seen the most
precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I praised her as I rated her: so do I my
stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">What do you esteem it at?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">More than the world enjoys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or
she&#8217;s
outprized by a trifle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given,
if
there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
and only the gift of the gods.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Which the gods have given you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Which, by their graces, I will keep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">You may wear her in title yours: but, you
know,
strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
estimations; the one is but frail and the other
casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Your Italy contains none so accomplished a
courtier
to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">Let us leave here, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior,
I
thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">With five times so much conversation, I should
get
ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">No, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate
to
your ring; which, in my opinion, o&#8217;ervalues it
something: but I make my wager rather against your
confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
lady in the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">You are a great deal abused in too bold a
persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you&#8217;re
worthy of by your attempt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">A repulse: though your attempt, as you call
it,
deserve more; a punishment too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too
suddenly;
let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
better acquainted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Would I had put my estate and my
neighbour&#8217;s on the
approbation of what I have spoke!</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">What lady would you choose to assail?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so
safe.
I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
second conference, and I will bring from thence
that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my
ring<br>
I hold dear as my finger; &#8217;tis part of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you
buy
ladies&#8217; flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
religion in you, that you fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear
a
graver purpose, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I am the master of my speeches, and would
undergo
what&#8217;s spoken, I swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till
your
return: let there be covenants drawn between&#8217;s: my
mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here&#8217;s my
ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">I will have it no lay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
free entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I embrace these conditions; let us have
articles
betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
remain unseduced, you not making it appear
otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
your sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things
set
down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
wagers recorded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Agreed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Posthumus Leonatus and
Iachimo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Frenchman</p>
<p class="speech">Will this hold, think you?</p>

Pray, let us follow &#8217;em.</p>

<p class="speech">But I beseech your grace, without
offence,&#8212;<br>
My conscience bids me ask&#8212;wherefore you have<br>
Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,<br>
Which are the movers of a languishing death;<br>
But though slow, deadly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder, doctor,<br>
Thou ask&#8217;st me such a question. Have I not been<br>
Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn&#8217;d me how<br>
To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so<br>
That our great king himself doth woo me oft<br>
For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,&#8212;<br>
Unless thou think&#8217;st me devilish&#8212;is&#8217;t not
meet<br>
That I did amplify my judgment in<br>
Other conclusions? I will try the forces<br>
Of these thy compounds on such creatures as<br>
We count not worth the hanging, but none human,<br>
To try the vigour of them and apply<br>
Allayments to their act, and by them gather<br>
Their several virtues and effects.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>

Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,<br>
And will not trust one of her malice with<br>
A drug of such damn&#8217;d nature. Those she has<br>
Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;<br>
Which first, perchance, she&#8217;ll prove on cats and dogs,<br>
Then afterward up higher: but there is<br>
No danger in what show of death it makes,<br>
More than the locking-up the spirits a time,<br>

With a most false effect; and I the truer,<br>

When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee on the instant thou art then<br>
As great as is thy master, greater, for<br>
His fortunes all lie speechless and his name<br>
Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor<br>
Continue where he is: to shift his being<br>

Five times redeem&#8217;d from death: I do not know<br>
What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;<br>
It is an earnest of a further good<br>
That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how<br>
The case stands with her; do&#8217;t as from thyself.<br>
Think what a chance thou changest on, but think<br>
Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,<br>
Who shall take notice of thee: I&#8217;ll move the king<br>
To any shape of thy preferment such<br>

Contemn with mows the other; nor i&#8217; the judgment,<br>
For idiots in this case of favour would<br>
Be wisely definite; nor i&#8217; the appetite;<br>
Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed<br>
Should make desire vomit emptiness,<br>
Not so allured to feed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter, trow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">The cloyed will,<br>
That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub<br>
Both fill&#8217;d and running, ravening first the lamb<br>
Longs after for the garbage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">What, dear sir,<br>
Thus raps you? Are you well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, madam; well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Pisanio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, sir, desire<br>
My man&#8217;s abode where I did leave him: he<br>
Is strange and peevish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">I was going, sir,<br>
To give him welcome.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Continues well my lord? His health, beseech
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there<br>
So merry and so gamesome: he is call&#8217;d<br>
The Briton reveller.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">When he was here,<br>
He did incline to sadness, and oft-times<br>
Not knowing why.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I never saw him sad.<br>
There is a Frenchman his companion, one<br>
An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves<br>
A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces<br>
The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton&#8212;<br>
Your lord, I mean&#8212;laughs from&#8217;s free lungs, cries
&#8216;O,<br>
Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows<br>
By history, report, or his own proof,<br>
What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose<br>
But must be, will his free hours languish for<br>
Assured bondage?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Will my lord say so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with
laughter:<br>
It is a recreation to be by<br>
And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,<br>
Some men are much to blame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Not he, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Not he: but yet heaven&#8217;s bounty towards him
might<br>
Be used more thankfully. In himself, &#8217;tis much;<br>
In you, which I account his beyond all talents,<br>
Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound<br>
To pity too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What do you pity, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Two creatures heartily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Am I one, sir?<br>
You look on me: what wreck discern you in me<br>
Deserves your pity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Lamentable! What,<br>
To hide me from the radiant sun and solace<br>
I&#8217; the dungeon by a snuff?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir,<br>
Deliver with more openness your answers<br>
To my demands. Why do you pity me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">That others do&#8212;<br>
I was about to say&#8212;enjoy your&#8212;But<br>
It is an office of the gods to venge it,<br>
Not mine to speak on &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">You do seem to know<br>
Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,&#8212;<br>
Since doubling things go ill often hurts more<br>
Than to be sure they do; for certainties<br>
Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,<br>
The remedy then born&#8212;discover to me<br>
What both you spur and stop.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Had I this cheek<br>
To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,<br>
Whose every touch, would force the feeler&#8217;s soul<br>
To the oath of loyalty; this object, which<br>
Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,<br>
Fixing it only here; should I, damn&#8217;d then,<br>
Slaver with lips as common as the stairs<br>
That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands<br>
Made hard with hourly falsehood&#8212;falsehood, as<br>
With labour; then by-peeping in an eye<br>
Base and unlustrous as the smoky light<br>
That&#8217;s fed with stinking tallow; it were fit<br>
That all the plagues of hell should at one time<br>
Encounter such revolt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I fear,<br>
Has forgot Britain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">And himself. Not I,<br>
Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce<br>
The beggary of his change; but &#8217;tis your graces<br>
That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue<br>
Charms this report out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Let me hear no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my
heart<br>
With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady<br>
So fair, and fasten&#8217;d to an empery,<br>
Would make the great&#8217;st king double,&#8212;to be
partner&#8217;d<br>
With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition<br>
Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures<br>
That play with all infirmities for gold<br>
Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil&#8217;d stuff<br>
As well might poison poison! Be revenged;<br>
Or she that bore you was no queen, and you<br>
Recoil from your great stock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Revenged!<br>
How should I be revenged? If this be true,&#8212;<br>
As I have such a heart that both mine ears<br>
Must not in haste abuse&#8212;if it be true,<br>
How should I be revenged?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Should he make me<br>
Live, like Diana&#8217;s priest, betwixt cold sheets,<br>
Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,<br>
In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.<br>
I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,<br>
More noble than that runagate to your bed,<br>
And will continue fast to your affection,<br>
Still close as sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">What, ho, Pisanio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Let me my service tender on your lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Away! I do condemn mine ears that have<br>
So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,<br>
Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not<br>
For such an end thou seek&#8217;st,&#8212;as base as strange.<br>
Thou wrong&#8217;st a gentleman, who is as far<br>
From thy report as thou from honour, and<br>
Solicit&#8217;st here a lady that disdains<br>
Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!<br>
The king my father shall be made acquainted<br>
Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,<br>
A saucy stranger in his court to mart<br>
As in a Romish stew and to expound<br>
His beastly mind to us, he hath a court<br>
He little cares for and a daughter who<br>
He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">O happy Leonatus! I may say<br>
The credit that thy lady hath of thee<br>
Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness<br>
Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!<br>
A lady to the worthiest sir that ever<br>
Country call&#8217;d his! and you his mistress, only<br>
For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.<br>
I have spoke this, to know if your affiance<br>
Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,<br>
That which he is, new o&#8217;er: and he is one<br>
The truest manner&#8217;d; such a holy witch<br>
That he enchants societies into him;<br>
Half all men&#8217;s hearts are his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">You make amends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">He sits &#8217;mongst men like a descended
god:<br>
He hath a kind of honour sets him off,<br>
More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,<br>
Most mighty princess, that I have adventured<br>
To try your taking a false report; which hath<br>
Honour&#8217;d with confirmation your great judgment<br>
In the election of a sir so rare,<br>
Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him<br>
Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,<br>
Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">All&#8217;s well, sir: take my power i&#8217; the
court
for yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">My humble thanks. I had almost forgot<br>
To entreat your grace but in a small request,<br>
And yet of moment to, for it concerns<br>
Your lord; myself and other noble friends,<br>
Are partners in the business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, what is&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Some dozen Romans of us and your lord&#8212;<br>
The best feather of our wing&#8212;have mingled sums<br>
To buy a present for the emperor<br>
Which I, the factor for the rest, have done<br>
In France: &#8217;tis plate of rare device, and jewels<br>
Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;<br>
And I am something curious, being strange,<br>
To have them in safe stowage: may it please you<br>
To take them in protection?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Willingly;<br>
And pawn mine honour for their safety: since<br>
My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them<br>
In my bedchamber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">They are in a trunk,<br>
Attended by my men: I will make bold<br>
To send them to you, only for this night;<br>
I must aboard to-morrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word<br>
By lengthening my return. From Gallia<br>
I cross&#8217;d the seas on purpose and on promise<br>
To see your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your pains:<br>
But not away to-morrow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">O, I must, madam:<br>
Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please<br>
To greet your lord with writing, do&#8217;t to-night:<br>
I have outstood my time; which is material<br>
To the tender of our present.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I will write.<br>
Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,<br>
And truly yielded you. You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>

jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a

Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken&#8217;d<br>
The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,<br>
How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,<br>
And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!<br>
But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon&#8217;d,<br>
How dearly they do&#8217;t! &#8217;Tis her breathing that<br>
Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o&#8217; the taper<br>
Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,<br>
To see the enclosed lights, now canopied<br>
Under these windows, white and azure laced<br>
With blue of heaven&#8217;s own tinct. But my design,<br>
To note the chamber: I will write all down:<br>
Such and such pictures; there the window; such<br>
The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,<br>
Why, such and such; and the contents o&#8217; the story.<br>
Ah, but some natural notes about her body,<br>
Above ten thousand meaner moveables<br>
Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.<br>
O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!<br>

Stronger than ever law could make: this secret<br>
Will force him think I have pick&#8217;d the lock and

The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?<br>
Why should I write this down, that&#8217;s riveted,<br>

To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.<br>

your

First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;

Who lets go by no vantages that may<br>
Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself<br>
To orderly soliciting, and be friended<br>
With aptness of the season; make denials<br>
Increase your services; so seem as if<br>
You were inspired to do those duties which<br>
You tender to her; that you in all obey her,<br>

That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,<br>
You put me to forget a lady&#8217;s manners,<br>
By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,<br>
That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,<br>
By the very truth of it, I care not for you,<br>
And am so near the lack of charity&#8212;<br>
To accuse myself&#8212;I hate you; which I had rather<br>
You felt than make&#8217;t my boast.</p>

And though it be allow&#8217;d in meaner parties&#8212;<br>
Yet who than he more mean?&#8212;to knit their souls,<br>
On whom there is no more dependency<br>
But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;<br>
Yet you are curb&#8217;d from that enlargement by<br>
The consequence o&#8217; the crown, and must not soil<br>
The precious note of it with a base slave.<br>
A hilding for a livery, a squire&#8217;s cloth,<br>
A pantler, not so eminent.</p>

To win the king as I am bold her honour<br>
Will remain hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What means do you make to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Not any, but abide the change of time,<br>
Quake in the present winter&#8217;s state and wish<br>
That warmer days would come: in these sear&#8217;d hopes,<br>
I barely gratify your love; they failing,<br>
I must die much your debtor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">Your very goodness and your company<br>
O&#8217;erpays all I can do. By this, your king<br>
Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius<br>
Will do&#8217;s commission throughly: and I think<br>
He&#8217;ll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,<br>
Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance<br>
Is yet fresh in their grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I do believe,<br>
Statist though I am none, nor like to be,<br>
That this will prove a war; and you shall hear<br>
The legions now in Gallia sooner landed<br>
In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings<br>
Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen<br>
Are men more order&#8217;d than when Julius Caesar<br>
Smiled at their lack of skill, but found their courage<br>
Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,<br>
Now mingled with their courages, will make known<br>
To their approvers they are people such<br>

<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I hope the briefness of your answer made<br>
The speediness of your return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Your lady<br>

<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">All is well yet.<br>
Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is&#8217;t not<br>
Too dull for your good wearing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">If I had lost it,<br>
I should have lost the worth of it in gold.<br>
I&#8217;ll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy<br>
A second night of such sweet shortness which<br>
Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>

<p class="speech">Good sir, we must,<br>

The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant<br>
We were to question further: but I now<br>
Profess myself the winner of her honour,<br>
Together with your ring; and not the wronger<br>
Of her or you, having proceeded but<br>
By both your wills.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">If you can make&#8217;t apparent<br>
That you have tasted her in bed, my hand<br>
And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion<br>
You had of her pure honour gains or loses<br>
Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both<br>
To who shall find them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my circumstances,<br>
Being so near the truth as I will make them,<br>
Must first induce you to believe: whose strength<br>
I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,<br>
You&#8217;ll give me leave to spare, when you shall find<br>
You need it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">First, her bedchamber,&#8212;<br>
Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess<br>
Had that was well worth watching&#8212;it was hang&#8217;d<br>
With tapesty of silk and silver; the story<br>
Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,<br>
And Cydnus swell&#8217;d above the banks, or for<br>
The press of boats or pride: a piece of work<br>
So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive<br>
In workmanship and value; which I wonder&#8217;d<br>
Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,<br>
Since the true life on&#8217;t was&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">This is true;<br>
And this you might have heard of here, by me,<br>
Or by some other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">More particulars<br>
Must justify my knowledge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">So they must,<br>
Or do your honour injury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">The chimney<br>
Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece<br>
Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures<br>
So likely to report themselves: the cutter<br>
Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,<br>
Motion and breath left out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">This is a thing<br>
Which you might from relation likewise reap,<br>
Being, as it is, much spoke of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">The roof o&#8217; the chamber<br>
With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons&#8212;<br>
I had forgot them&#8212;were two winking Cupids<br>
Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely<br>
Depending on their brands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">This is her honour!<br>
Let it be granted you have seen all this&#8212;and praise<br>
Be given to your remembrance&#8212;the description<br>
Of what is in her chamber nothing saves<br>
The wager you have laid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Then, if you can,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Showing the
bracelet</span></p>
<p class="speech">Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel;
see!<br>
And now &#8217;tis up again: it must be married<br>
To that your diamond; I&#8217;ll keep them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Jove!<br>
Once more let me behold it: is it that<br>
Which I left with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir&#8212;I thank her&#8212;that:<br>
She stripp&#8217;d it from her arm; I see her yet;<br>
Her pretty action did outsell her gift,<br>
And yet enrich&#8217;d it too: she gave it me, and said<br>
She prized it once.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">May be she pluck&#8217;d it off<br>
To send it me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">She writes so to you, doth she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, no, no! &#8217;tis true. Here, take this
too;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gives the ring</span></p>
<p class="speech">It is a basilisk unto mine eye,<br>
Kills me to look on&#8217;t. Let there be no honour<br>
Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,<br>
Where there&#8217;s another man: the vows of women<br>
Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,<br>
Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.<br>
O, above measure false!</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, sir,<br>
And take your ring again; &#8217;tis not yet won:<br>
It may be probable she lost it; or<br>
Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,<br>
Hath stol&#8217;n it from her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Very true;<br>
And so, I hope, he came by&#8217;t. Back my ring:<br>
Render to me some corporal sign about her,<br>
More evident than this; for this was stolen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.<br>
&#8217;Tis true:&#8212;nay, keep the ring&#8212;&#8217;tis true: I
am sure<br>
She would not lose it: her attendants are<br>
All sworn and honourable:&#8212;they induced to steal it!<br>
And by a stranger!&#8212;No, he hath enjoyed her:<br>
The cognizance of her incontinency<br>
Is this: she hath bought the name of whore thus dearly.<br>
There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell<br>
Divide themselves between you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Philario</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, be patient:<br>
This is not strong enough to be believed<br>
Of one persuaded well of&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Never talk on&#8217;t;<br>
She hath been colted by him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">If you seek<br>
For further satisfying, under her breast&#8212;<br>
Worthy the pressing&#8212;lies a mole, right proud<br>
Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,<br>
I kiss&#8217;d it; and it gave me present hunger<br>
To feed again, though full. You do remember<br>
This stain upon her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and it doth confirm<br>
Another stain, as big as hell can hold,<br>
Were there no more but it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hear more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;<br>
Once, and a million!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be sworn&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">No swearing.<br>
If you will swear you have not done&#8217;t, you lie;<br>
And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny<br>
Thou&#8217;st made me cuckold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll deny nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">O, that I had her here, to tear her
limb-meal!<br>
I will go there and do&#8217;t, i&#8217; the court, before<br>

<p class="speech">When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet<br>
Lives in men&#8217;s eyes and will to ears and tongues<br>
Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain<br>
And conquer&#8217;d it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,&#8212;<br>
Famous in Caesar&#8217;s praises, no whit less<br>
Than in his feats deserving it&#8212;for him<br>
And his succession granted Rome a tribute,<br>
Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately<br>
Is left untender&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">And, to kill the marvel,<br>
Shall be so ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">There be many Caesars,<br>
Ere such another Julius. Britain is<br>
A world by itself; and we will nothing pay<br>
For wearing our own noses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">That opportunity<br>
Which then they had to take from &#8217;s, to resume<br>
We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,<br>
The kings your ancestors, together with<br>
The natural bravery of your isle, which stands<br>
As Neptune&#8217;s park, ribbed and paled in<br>
With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,<br>
With sands that will not bear your enemies&#8217; boats,<br>
But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest<br>
Caesar made here; but made not here his brag<br>
Of &#8216;Came&#8217; and &#8216;saw&#8217; and &#8216;overcame&#8217; with shame&#8212;<br>
That first that ever touch&#8217;d him&#8212;he was carried<br>
From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping&#8212;<br>
Poor ignorant baubles!&#8212; upon our terrible seas,<br>
Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack&#8217;d<br>
As easily &#8217;gainst our rocks: for joy whereof<br>
The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point&#8212;<br>
O giglot fortune!&#8212;to master Caesar&#8217;s sword,<br>
Made Lud&#8217;s town with rejoicing fires bright<br>
And Britons strut with courage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">Come, there&#8217;s no more tribute to be paid:
our
kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
them may have crook&#8217;d noses, but to owe such
straight arms, none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Son, let your mother end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">We have yet many among us can gripe as hard
as
Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">You must know,<br>
Till the injurious Romans did extort<br>
This tribute from us, we were free:<br>
Caesar&#8217;s ambition,<br>
Which swell&#8217;d so much that it did almost stretch<br>
The sides o&#8217; the world, against all colour here<br>
Did put the yoke upon &#8217;s; which to shake off<br>
Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon<br>
Ourselves to be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speaker">Lords</p>
<p class="speech">We do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Say, then, to Caesar,<br>
Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which<br>
Ordain&#8217;d our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar<br>
Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise<br>
Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,<br>
Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,<br>
Who was the first of Britain which did put<br>
His brows within a golden crown and call&#8217;d<br>
Himself a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I am sorry, Cymbeline,<br>
That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar&#8212;<br>
Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than<br>
Thyself domestic officers&#8212;thine enemy:<br>
Receive it from me, then: war and confusion<br>
In Caesar&#8217;s name pronounce I &#8217;gainst thee: look<br>
For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,<br>
I thank thee for myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art welcome, Caius.<br>
Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent<br>
Much under him; of him I gather&#8217;d honour;<br>
Which he to seek of me again, perforce,<br>
Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect<br>
That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for<br>
Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent<br>
Which not to read would show the Britons cold:<br>
So Caesar shall not find them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Let proof speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">His majesty bids you welcome. Make
pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
for you; and there&#8217;s an end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">So, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I know your master&#8217;s pleasure and he
mine:<br>
All the remain is &#8216;Welcome!&#8217;</p>

Thy mind to her is now as low as were<br>

Upon the love and truth and vows which I<br>
Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?<br>

Some griefs are med&#8217;cinable; that is one of them,<br>

You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers<br>

<p class="speech">A goodly day not to keep house, with such<br>
Whose roof&#8217;s as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate<br>
Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you<br>
To a morning&#8217;s holy office: the gates of monarchs<br>
Are arch&#8217;d so high that giants may jet through<br>
And keep their impious turbans on, without<br>
Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!<br>

Your legs are young; I&#8217;ll tread these flats. Consider,<br>
When you above perceive me like a crow,<br>
That it is place which lessens and sets off;<br>
And you may then revolve what tales I have told you<br>
Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:<br>
This service is not service, so being done,<br>
But being so allow&#8217;d: to apprehend thus,<br>
Draws us a profit from all things we see;<br>
And often, to our comfort, shall we find<br>
The sharded beetle in a safer hold<br>
Than is the full-wing&#8217;d eagle. O, this life<br>

Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,<br>
Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:<br>

Have never wing&#8217;d from view o&#8217; the nest, nor know
not<br>
What air&#8217;s from home. Haply this life is best,<br>
If quiet life be best; sweeter to you<br>
That have a sharper known; well corresponding<br>
With your stiff age: but unto us it is<br>

The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;<br>

Is certain falling, or so slippery that<br>
The fear&#8217;s as bad as falling; the toil o&#8217; the war,<br>
A pain that only seems to seek out danger<br>
I&#8217; the name of fame and honour; which dies i&#8217; the
search,<br>
And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph<br>
As record of fair act; nay, many times,<br>
Doth ill deserve by doing well; what&#8217;s worse,<br>
Must court&#8217;sy at the censure:&#8212;O boys, this story<br>
The world may read in me: my body&#8217;s mark&#8217;d<br>
With Roman swords, and my report was once<br>
First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,<br>
And when a soldier was the theme, my name<br>
Was not far off: then was I as a tree<br>
Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,<br>
A storm or robbery, call it what you will,<br>
Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,<br>
And left me bare to weather.</p>

I was confederate with the Romans: so<br>
Follow&#8217;d my banishment, and this twenty years<br>
This rock and these demesnes have been my world;<br>
Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid<br>
More pious debts to heaven than in all<br>
The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!<br>
This is not hunters&#8217; language: he that strikes<br>
The venison first shall be the lord o&#8217; the feast;<br>

The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them<br>

And thus I set my foot on &#8217;s neck;&#8217; even then<br>
The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,<br>
Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture<br>
That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,<br>
Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,<br>
Strikes life into my speech and shows much more<br>
His own conceiving.&#8212;Hark, the game is roused!<br>
O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows<br>
Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,<br>
At three and two years old, I stole these babes;<br>
Thinking to bar thee of succession, as<br>
Thou reft&#8217;st me of my lands. Euriphile,<br>

<p class="speech">Do&#8217;t, and to bed then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll wake mine eye-balls blind first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore then<br>
Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused<br>
So many miles with a pretence? this place?<br>
Mine action and thine own? our horses&#8217; labour?<br>
The time inviting thee? the perturb&#8217;d court,<br>
For my being absent? whereunto I never<br>
Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,<br>
To be unbent when thou hast ta&#8217;en thy stand,<br>
The elected deer before thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">But to win time<br>
To lose so bad employment; in the which<br>
I have consider&#8217;d of a course. Good lady,<br>
Hear me with patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Talk thy tongue weary; speak<br>
I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear<br>
Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,<br>
Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Then, madam,<br>
I thought you would not back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Most like;<br>
Bringing me here to kill me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, neither:<br>
But if I were as wise as honest, then<br>
My purpose would prove well. It cannot be<br>
But that my master is abused:<br>
Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.<br>
Hath done you both this cursed injury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Some Roman courtezan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">No, on my life.<br>
I&#8217;ll give but notice you are dead and send him<br>
Some bloody sign of it; for &#8217;tis commanded<br>
I should do so: you shall be miss&#8217;d at court,<br>
And that will well confirm it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Why good fellow,<br>
What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?<br>
Or in my life what comfort, when I am<br>
Dead to my husband?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">If you&#8217;ll back to the court&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No court, no father; nor no more ado<br>
With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,<br>
That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me<br>
As fearful as a siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">If not at court,<br>
Then not in Britain must you bide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Where then<br>
Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,<br>
Are they not but in Britain? I&#8217; the world&#8217;s volume<br>
Our Britain seems as of it, but not in &#8217;t;<br>
In a great pool a swan&#8217;s nest: prithee, think<br>
There&#8217;s livers out of Britain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">I am most glad<br>
You think of other place. The ambassador,<br>
Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven<br>
To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind<br>
Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise<br>
That which, to appear itself, must not yet be<br>
But by self-danger, you should tread a course<br>
Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near<br>
The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least<br>
That though his actions were not visible, yet<br>
Report should render him hourly to your ear<br>
As truly as he moves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">O, for such means!<br>
Though peril to my modesty, not death on&#8217;t,<br>
I would adventure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, then, here&#8217;s the point:<br>
You must forget to be a woman; change<br>
Command into obedience: fear and niceness&#8212;<br>
The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,<br>
Woman its pretty self&#8212;into a waggish courage:<br>
Ready in gibes, quick-answer&#8217;d, saucy and<br>
As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must<br>
Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,<br>
Exposing it&#8212;but, O, the harder heart!<br>
Alack, no remedy!&#8212;to the greedy touch<br>
Of common-kissing Titan, and forget<br>
Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein<br>
You made great Juno angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, be brief<br>
I see into thy end, and am almost<br>
A man already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">First, make yourself but like one.<br>
Fore-thinking this, I have already fit&#8212;<br>
&#8217;Tis in my cloak-bag&#8212;doublet, hat, hose, all<br>
That answer to them: would you in their serving,<br>
And with what imitation you can borrow<br>
From youth of such a season, &#8217;fore noble Lucius<br>
Present yourself, desire his service, tell him<br>
Wherein you&#8217;re happy,&#8212;which you&#8217;ll make him
know,<br>
If that his head have ear in music,&#8212;doubtless<br>
With joy he will embrace you, for he&#8217;s honourable<br>
And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,<br>
You have me, rich; and I will never fail<br>
Beginning nor supplyment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art all the comfort<br>
The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:<br>
There&#8217;s more to be consider&#8217;d; but we&#8217;ll even<br>
All that good time will give us: this attempt<br>
I am soldier to, and will abide it with<br>
A prince&#8217;s courage. Away, I prithee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,<br>
Lest, being miss&#8217;d, I be suspected of<br>
Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,<br>
Here is a box; I had it from the queen:<br>
What&#8217;s in&#8217;t is precious; if you are sick at sea,<br>
Or stomach-qualm&#8217;d at land, a dram of this<br>
Will drive away distemper. To some shade,<br>
And fit you to your manhood. May the gods<br>
Direct you to the best!</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Amen: I thank thee.</p>

Sirrah, if thou
wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
undergo those employments wherein I should have
cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
what villany soe&#8217;er I bid thee do, to perform it
directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
relief nor my voice for thy preferment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cloten</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and

that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
mine: wilt thou serve me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will.</p>

him one
thing; I&#8217;ll remember&#8217;t anon:&#8212;even there, thou
villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
garments were come. She said upon a time&#8212;the
bitterness of it I now belch from my heart&#8212;that she
held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
than my noble and natural person together with the
adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
when my lust hath dined,&#8212;which, as I say, to vex
her I will execute in the clothes that she so
praised,&#8212;to the court I&#8217;ll knock her back, foot
her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,

conversant in general services, and more remarkable
in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
father; who may haply be a little angry for my so

Absolute madness could so far have raved<br>
To bring him here alone; although perhaps<br>
It may be heard at court that such as we<br>
Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time<br>
May make some stronger head; the which he hearing&#8212;<br>
As it is like him&#8212;might break out, and swear<br>
He&#8217;ld fetch us in; yet is&#8217;t not probable<br>

That angel of the world, doth make distinction<br>

But that the heavens fought: the king himself<br>
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,<br>
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<br>
More plentiful than tools to do&#8217;t, struck down<br>
Some mortally, some slightly touch&#8217;d, some falling<br>
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm&#8217;d<br>

An honest one, I warrant; who deserved<br>
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<br>
In doing this for&#8217;s country: athwart the lane,<br>
He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>
The country base than to commit such slaughter<br>
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer<br>
Than those for preservation cased, or shame&#8212;<br>
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>
&#8216;Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<br>
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<br>
Or we are Romans and will give you that<br>
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.&#8217;<br>
These three,<br>
Three thousand confident, in act as many&#8212;<br>
For three performers are the file when all<br>
The rest do nothing&#8212;with this word &#8216;stand,
stand,&#8217;<br>
Accommodated by the place, more charming<br>
With their own nobleness, which could have turn&#8217;d<br>
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>
Part shame, part spirit renew&#8217;d; that some, turn&#8217;d
coward<br>
But by example&#8212;O, a sin in war,<br>
Damn&#8217;d in the first beginners!&#8212;gan to look<br>
The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>
Upon the pikes o&#8217; the hunters. Then began<br>
A stop i&#8217; the chaser, a retire, anon<br>
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>
Chickens, the way which they stoop&#8217;d eagles; slaves,<br>
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<br>
Like fragments in hard voyages, became<br>
The life o&#8217; the need: having found the backdoor open<br>
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<br>
O&#8217;er borne i&#8217; the former wave: ten, chased by one,<br>
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:<br>
Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>
The mortal bugs o&#8217; the field.</p>

sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain

With dignities becoming your estates.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cornelius and
Ladies</span></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s business in these faces. Why so
sadly<br>
Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,<br>
And not o&#8217; the court of Britain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, great king!<br>
To sour your happiness, I must report<br>
The queen is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Who worse than a physician<br>
Would this report become? But I consider,<br>
By medicine life may be prolong&#8217;d, yet death<br>
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">With horror, madly dying, like her life,<br>
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded<br>
Most cruel to herself. What she confess&#8217;d<br>
I will report, so please you: these her women<br>
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks<br>
Were present when she finish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">First, she confess&#8217;d she never loved you,
only<br>
Affected greatness got by you, not you:<br>
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;<br>
Abhorr&#8217;d your person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">She alone knew this;<br>
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not<br>
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love<br>
With such integrity, she did confess<br>
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,<br>
But that her flight prevented it, she had<br>
Ta&#8217;en off by poison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O most delicate fiend!<br>
Who is &#8217;t can read a woman? Is there more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had<br>
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,<br>
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering<br>
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,<br>
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to<br>
O&#8217;ercome you with her show, and in time,<br>
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work<br>
Her son into the adoption of the crown:<br>
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,<br>
Grew shameless-desperate; open&#8217;d, in despite<br>
Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented<br>
The evils she hatch&#8217;d were not effected; so<br>
Despairing died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Heard you all this, her women?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lady</p>
<p class="speech">We did, so please your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eyes<br>
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;<br>
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,<br>
That thought her like her seeming; it had been vicious<br>
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!<br>
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,<br>
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius, Iachimo, the
Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; Posthumus Leonatus
behind, and Imogen</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that<br>
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss<br>
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit<br>
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter<br>
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:<br>
So think of your estate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day<br>
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,<br>
We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten&#8217;d<br>
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods<br>
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives<br>
May be call&#8217;d ransom, let it come: sufficeth<br>
A Roman with a Roman&#8217;s heart can suffer:<br>
Augustus lives to think on&#8217;t: and so much<br>
For my peculiar care. This one thing only<br>
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,<br>
Let him be ransom&#8217;d: never master had<br>
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,<br>
So tender over his occasions, true,<br>
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join<br>
With my request, which I make bold your highness<br>
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,<br>
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,<br>
And spare no blood beside.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I have surely seen him:<br>
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,<br>
Thou hast look&#8217;d thyself into my grace,<br>
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,<br>
To say &#8216;live, boy:&#8217; ne&#8217;er thank thy master;
live:<br>
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,<br>
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I&#8217;ll give it;<br>
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,<br>
The noblest ta&#8217;en.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I humbly thank your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;<br>
And yet I know thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No, no: alack,<br>
There&#8217;s other work in hand: I see a thing<br>
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,<br>
Must shuffle for itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">The boy disdains me,<br>
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys<br>
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.<br>
Why stands he so perplex&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou, boy?<br>
I love thee more and more: think more and more<br>
What&#8217;s best to ask. Know&#8217;st him thou look&#8217;st on?
speak,<br>
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">He is a Roman; no more kin to me<br>
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,<br>
Am something nearer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore eyest him so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell you, sir, in private, if you
please<br>
To give me hearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, with all my heart,<br>
And lend my best attention. What&#8217;s thy name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">Fidele, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou&#8217;rt my good youth, my

I&#8217;ll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cymbeline and Imogen converse

<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this boy revived from death?</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">One sand another<br>
Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad<br>
Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speech">The same dead thing alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not;
forbear;<br>
Creatures may be alike: were &#8217;t he, I am sure<br>
He would have spoke to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speech">But we saw him dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Be silent; let&#8217;s see further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> It is my

<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>

Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;<br>
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,<br>
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall<br>
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">My boon is, that this gentleman may render<br>
Of whom he had this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What&#8217;s
that to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">That diamond upon your finger, say<br>
How came it yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou&#8217;lt torture me to leave unspoken
that<br>
Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">How! me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to be constrain&#8217;d to utter
that<br>
Which torments me to conceal. By villany<br>
I got this ring: &#8217;twas Leonatus&#8217; jewel;<br>
Whom thou didst banish; and&#8212;which more may grieve thee,<br>
As it doth me&#8212;a nobler sir ne&#8217;er lived<br>
&#8217;Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">All that belongs to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">That paragon, thy daughter,&#8212;<br>
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits<br>
Quail to remember&#8212;Give me leave; I faint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:<br>
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will<br>
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Upon a time,&#8212;unhappy was the clock<br>
That struck the hour!&#8212;it was in Rome,&#8212;accursed<br>
The mansion where!&#8212;&#8217;twas at a feast,&#8212;O, would<br>
Our viands had been poison&#8217;d, or at least<br>
Those which I heaved to head!&#8212;the good Posthumus&#8212;<br>
What should I say? he was too good to be<br>
Where ill men were; and was the best of all<br>
Amongst the rarest of good ones,&#8212;sitting sadly,<br>
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy<br>
For beauty that made barren the swell&#8217;d boast<br>
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming<br>
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.<br>
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,<br>
A shop of all the qualities that man<br>
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,<br>
Fairness which strikes the eye&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I stand on fire:<br>
Come to the matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">All too soon I shall,<br>
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,<br>
Most like a noble lord in love and one<br>
That had a royal lover, took his hint;<br>
And, not dispraising whom we praised,&#8212;therein<br>
He was as calm as virtue&#8212;he began<br>
His mistress&#8217; picture; which by his tongue being made,<br>
And then a mind put in&#8217;t, either our brags<br>
Were crack&#8217;d of kitchen-trolls, or his description<br>
Proved us unspeaking sots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, nay, to the purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Your daughter&#8217;s chastity&#8212;there it
begins.<br>
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<br>
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<br>
Made scruple of his praise; and wager&#8217;d with him<br>
Pieces of gold &#8217;gainst this which then he wore<br>
Upon his honour&#8217;d finger, to attain<br>
In suit the place of&#8217;s bed and win this ring<br>
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br>
No lesser of her honour confident<br>
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br>
And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br>
Of Phoebus&#8217; wheel, and might so safely, had it<br>
Been all the worth of&#8217;s car. Away to Britain<br>
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<br>
Remember me at court; where I was taught<br>
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br>
&#8217;Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench&#8217;d<br>
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<br>
&#8217;Gan in your duller Britain operate<br>
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<br>
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail&#8217;d,<br>
That I return&#8217;d with simular proof enough<br>
To make the noble Leonatus mad,<br>
By wounding his belief in her renown<br>
With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<br>
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,&#8212;<br>
O cunning, how I got it!&#8212;nay, some marks<br>
Of secret on her person, that he could not<br>
But think her bond of chastity quite crack&#8217;d,<br>
I having ta&#8217;en the forfeit. Whereupon&#8212;<br>
Methinks, I see him now&#8212;</p>

<p class="speech">The queen, sir, very oft importuned me<br>
To temper poisons for her, still pretending<br>

Was of more danger, did compound for her<br>
A certain stuff, which, being ta&#8217;en, would cease<br>

<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">So sure as you your father&#8217;s. I, old
Morgan,<br>
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish&#8217;d:<br>
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment<br>
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer&#8217;d<br>
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes&#8212;<br>
For such and so they are&#8212;these twenty years<br>
Have I train&#8217;d up: those arts they have as I<br>
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as<br>
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,<br>
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children<br>
Upon my banishment: I moved her to&#8217;t,<br>
Having received the punishment before,<br>
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty<br>
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,<br>
The more of you &#8217;twas felt, the more it shaped<br>
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,<br>
Here are your sons again; and I must lose<br>
Two of the sweet&#8217;st companions in the world.<br>
The benediction of these covering heavens<br>
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy<br>
To inlay heaven with stars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou weep&#8217;st, and speak&#8217;st.<br>
The service that you three have done is more<br>
Unlike than this thou tell&#8217;st. I lost my children:<br>
If these be they, I know not how to wish<br>
A pair of worthier sons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Be pleased awhile.<br>
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,<br>
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:<br>
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,<br>
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp&#8217;d<br>
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand<br>
Of his queen mother, which for more probation<br>
I can with ease produce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Guiderius had<br>
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;<br>
It was a mark of wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">This is he;<br>
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:<br>
It was wise nature&#8217;s end in the donation,<br>
To be his evidence now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O, what, am I<br>
A mother to the birth of three? Ne&#8217;er mother<br>
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,<br>
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,<br>
May reign in them now! O Imogen,<br>
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord;<br>
I have got two worlds by &#8217;t. O my gentle brothers,<br>
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter<br>
But I am truest speaker you call&#8217;d me brother,<br>
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,<br>
When ye were so indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Did you e&#8217;er meet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And at first meeting loved;<br>
Continued so, until we thought he died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">By the queen&#8217;s dram she
swallow&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O rare instinct!<br>
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement<br>
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which<br>
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?<br>
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?<br>
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?<br>
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,<br>
And your three motives to the battle, with<br>
I know not how much more, should be demanded;<br>
And all the other by-dependencies,<br>
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place<br>
Will serve our long inter&#8217;gatories. See,<br>
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,<br>
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye<br>
On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting<br>
Each object with a joy: the counterchange<br>
Is severally in all. Let&#8217;s quit this ground,<br>
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Belarius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou art my brother; so we&#8217;ll hold thee
ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">You are my father too, and did relieve me,<br>
To see this gracious season.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">All o&#8217;erjoy&#8217;d,<br>
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,<br>
For they shall taste our comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">My good master,<br>
I will yet do you service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Happy be you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,<br>
He would have well becomed this place, and graced<br>
The thankings of a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I am, sir,<br>
The soldier that did company these three<br>
In poor beseeming; &#8217;twas a fitment for<br>
The purpose I then follow&#8217;d. That I was he,<br>
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might<br>
Have made you finish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> I am down
again:<br>
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,<br>
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,<br>
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;<br>
And here the bracelet of the truest princess<br>
That ever swore her faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Kneel not to me:<br>
The power that I have on you is, to spare you;<br>
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,<br>
And deal with others better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nobly doom&#8217;d!<br>
We&#8217;ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;<br>
Pardon&#8217;s the word to all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">You holp us, sir,<br>
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;<br>
Joy&#8217;d are we that you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,<br>
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought<br>
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back&#8217;d,<br>
Appear&#8217;d to me, with other spritely shows<br>
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found<br>
This label on my bosom; whose containing<br>
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can<br>
Make no collection of it: let him show<br>
His skill in the construction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Philarmonus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Here, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Read, and declare the meaning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;When as
a lion&#8217;s whelp shall, to himself
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
peace and plenty.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, Leonatus, art the lion&#8217;s whelp;<br>
The fit and apt construction of thy name,<br>
Being Leonatus, doth import so much.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Cymbeline</span></p>
<p class="speech">The piece of tender air, thy virtuous
daughter,<br>
Which we call &#8216;mollis aer;&#8217; and &#8216;mollis
aer&#8217;<br>
We term it &#8216;mulier:&#8217; which &#8216;mulier&#8217; I
divine<br>
Is this most constant wife; who, even now,<br>
Answering the letter of the oracle,<br>
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp&#8217;d about<br>
With this most tender air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">This hath some seeming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,<br>
Personates thee: and thy lopp&#8217;d branches point<br>
Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol&#8217;n,<br>
For many years thought dead, are now revived,<br>
To the majestic cedar join&#8217;d, whose issue<br>
Promises Britain peace and plenty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Well<br>
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,<br>
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,<br>
And to the Roman empire; promising<br>
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which<br>
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;<br>
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,<br>
Have laid most heavy hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">The fingers of the powers above do tune<br>
The harmony of this peace. The vision<br>
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke<br>
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant<br>
Is full accomplish&#8217;d; for the Roman eagle,<br>
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,<br>
Lessen&#8217;d herself, and in the beams o&#8217; the sun<br>
So vanish&#8217;d: which foreshow&#8217;d our princely eagle,<br>
The imperial Caesar, should again unite<br>
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,<br>
Which shines here in the west.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Laud we the gods;<br>
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils<br>
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace<br>
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let<br>
A Roman and a British ensign wave<br>
Friendly together: so through Lud&#8217;s-town march:<br>
And in the temple of great Jupiter<br>
Our peace we&#8217;ll ratify; seal it with feasts.<br>
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,<br>
Ere bloody hands were wash&#8217;d, with such a peace.</p>
