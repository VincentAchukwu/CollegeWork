<h4>Scene I. London. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry, Lord John
Of Lancaster, the Earl of Westmoreland, Sir Walter Blunt, and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">So shaken as we are, so wan with care,<br>
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,<br>
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils<br>
To be commenced in strands afar remote.<br>
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil<br>
Shall daub her lips with her own children&#8217;s blood;<br>
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,<br>
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs<br>
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,<br>
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,<br>
All of one nature, of one substance bred,<br>
Did lately meet in the intestine shock<br>
And furious close of civil butchery<br>
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,<br>
March all one way and be no more opposed<br>
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:<br>
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,<br>
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,<br>
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,<br>
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross<br>
We are impressed and engaged to fight,<br>
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;<br>
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers&#8217; womb<br>
To chase these pagans in those holy fields<br>
Over whose acres walk&#8217;d those blessed feet<br>
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail&#8217;d<br>
For our advantage on the bitter cross.<br>
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,<br>
And bootless &#8217;tis to tell you we will go:<br>
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear<br>
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,<br>
What yesternight our council did decree<br>
In forwarding this dear expedience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, this haste was hot in question,<br>
And many limits of the charge set down<br>
But yesternight: when all athwart there came<br>
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;<br>
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,<br>
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight<br>
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,<br>
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,<br>
A thousand of his people butchered;<br>
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,<br>
Such beastly shameless transformation,<br>
By those Welshwomen done as may not be<br>
Without much shame retold or spoken of.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">It seems then that the tidings of this broil<br>
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">This match&#8217;d with other did, my gracious
lord;<br>
For more uneven and unwelcome news<br>
Came from the north and thus it did import:<br>
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,<br>
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,<br>
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,<br>
At Holmedon met,<br>
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,<br>
As by discharge of their artillery,<br>
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;<br>
For he that brought them, in the very heat<br>
And pride of their contention did take horse,<br>
Uncertain of the issue any way.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,<br>
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.<br>
Stain&#8217;d with the variation of each soil<br>
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;<br>
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.<br>
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:<br>
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,<br>
Balk&#8217;d in their own blood did Sir Walter see<br>
On Holmedon&#8217;s plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took<br>
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son<br>
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,<br>
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:<br>
And is not this an honourable spoil?<br>
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">In faith,<br>
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me
sin<br>
In envy that my Lord Northumberland<br>
Should be the father to so blest a son,<br>
A son who is the theme of honour&#8217;s tongue;<br>
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;<br>
Who is sweet Fortune&#8217;s minion and her pride:<br>
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,<br>
See riot and dishonour stain the brow<br>
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved<br>
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged<br>
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,<br>
And call&#8217;d mine Percy, his Plantagenet!<br>
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.<br>
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,<br>
Of this young Percy&#8217;s pride? the prisoners,<br>
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,<br>
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,<br>
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">This is his uncle&#8217;s teaching; this is
Worcester,<br>
Malevolent to you in all aspects;<br>
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up<br>
The crest of youth against your dignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">But I have sent for him to answer this;<br>
And for this cause awhile we must neglect<br>
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.<br>
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we<br>
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:<br>
But come yourself with speed to us again;<br>
For more is to be said and to be done<br>
Than out of anger can be uttered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my liege.</p>

<h4>Scene II. London. An apartment of the Prince&#8217;s.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Prince Of Wales and
Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old
sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that
take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
by Phoebus, he,&#8217;that wandering knight so fair.&#8217;
And,
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
save thy grace,&#8212;majesty I should say, for grace
thou wilt have none,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What, none?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let
not
us that are squires of the night&#8217;s body be called
thieves of the day&#8217;s beauty: let us be Diana&#8217;s
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for
the
fortune of us that are the moon&#8217;s men doth ebb and
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
swearing &#8220;Lay by&#8221; and spent with crying &#8220;Bring
in;&#8221;
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not
my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle.
And
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips
and
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of
the tavern?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many
a
time and oft.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No; I&#8217;ll give thee thy due, thou hast paid
all there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would
stretch;
and where it would not, I have used my credit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and so used it that were it not here
apparent
that thou art heir apparent&#8212;But, I prithee, sweet
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">No; thou shalt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I&#8217;ll be a
brave judge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt
have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with
my
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">For obtaining of suits?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the
hangman
hath no lean wardrobe. &#8217;sblood, I am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Or an old lion, or a lover&#8217;s lute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy
of<br>
Moor-ditch?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art
indeed
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
streets, and no man regards it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed
able
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
should speak truly, little better than one of the
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
I&#8217;ll be damned for never a king&#8217;s son in
Christendom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I&#8217;ll
make one; an I
do not, call me villain and baffle me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I see a good amendment of life in thee; from
praying
to purse-taking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Hal, &#8217;tis my vocation, Hal; &#8217;tis
no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Poins</span></p>
<p class="speech">Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set
a
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried &#8220;stand&#8221; to
a true man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, Ned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur
Remorse?
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
and a cold capon&#8217;s leg?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall
have
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with
the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Else he had been damned for cozening the
devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by
four
o&#8217;clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
at home and be hanged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go
not,<br>
I&#8217;ll hang you for going.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">You will, chops?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Hal, wilt thou make one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s neither honesty, manhood, nor
good
fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well then, once in my days I&#8217;ll be a
madcap.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s well said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, come what will, I&#8217;ll tarry at
home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, I&#8217;ll be a traitor then, when
thou art king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I care not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me
alone:
I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
that he shall go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and
him
the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
move and what he hears may be believed, that the
true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell,
All-hallown summer!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
yourself and I will not be there; and when they
have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
this head off from my shoulders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">How shall we part with them in setting forth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Why, we will set forth before or after them,
and
appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
no sooner achieved, but we&#8217;ll set upon them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but &#8217;tis like that they will know us
by our
horses, by our habits and by every other
appointment, to be ourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Tut! our horses they shall not see: I&#8217;ll
tie them
in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I&#8217;ll
forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
lies the jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I&#8217;ll go with thee: provide us all
things
necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;

<p class="speech">I know you all, and will awhile uphold<br>
The unyoked humour of your idleness:<br>
Yet herein will I imitate the sun,<br>
Who doth permit the base contagious clouds<br>
To smother up his beauty from the world,<br>
That, when he please again to be himself,<br>
Being wanted, he may be more wonder&#8217;d at,<br>
By breaking through the foul and ugly mists<br>
Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.<br>
If all the year were playing holidays,<br>
To sport would be as tedious as to work;<br>
But when they seldom come, they wish&#8217;d for come,<br>
And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.<br>
So, when this loose behavior I throw off<br>
And pay the debt I never promised,<br>
By how much better than my word I am,<br>
By so much shall I falsify men&#8217;s hopes;<br>
And like bright metal on a sullen ground,<br>
My reformation, glittering o&#8217;er my fault,<br>
Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes<br>
Than that which hath no foil to set it off.<br>
I&#8217;ll so offend, to make offence a skill;<br>
Redeeming time when men think least I will.</p>

<p class="speech">My blood hath been too cold and temperate,<br>
Unapt to stir at these indignities,<br>
And you have found me; for accordingly<br>
You tread upon my patience: but be sure<br>
I will from henceforth rather be myself,<br>
Mighty and to be fear&#8217;d, than my condition;<br>

Which the proud soul ne&#8217;er pays but to the proud.</p>

<p class="speech">My lord.&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see<br>
Danger and disobedience in thine eye:<br>
O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,<br>
And majesty might never yet endure<br>
The moody frontier of a servant brow.<br>
You have good leave to leave us: when we need<br>
Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Worcester</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To North</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, my good lord.<br>
Those prisoners in your highness&#8217; name demanded,<br>
Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,<br>
Were, as he says, not with such strength denied<br>
As is deliver&#8217;d to your majesty:<br>
Either envy, therefore, or misprison<br>
Is guilty of this fault and not my son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, I did deny no prisoners.<br>
But I remember, when the fight was done,<br>
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,<br>
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,<br>
Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress&#8217;d,<br>
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap&#8217;d<br>
Show&#8217;d like a stubble-land at harvest-home;<br>
He was perfumed like a milliner;<br>
And &#8217;twixt his finger and his thumb he held<br>
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon<br>
He gave his nose and took&#8217;t away again;<br>
Who therewith angry, when it next came there,<br>
Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk&#8217;d,<br>
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,<br>
He call&#8217;d them untaught knaves, unmannerly,<br>
To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse<br>
Betwixt the wind and his nobility.<br>
With many holiday and lady terms<br>
He question&#8217;d me; amongst the rest, demanded<br>
My prisoners in your majesty&#8217;s behalf.<br>
I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,<br>
To be so pester&#8217;d with a popinjay,<br>
Out of my grief and my impatience,<br>
Answer&#8217;d neglectingly I know not what,<br>
He should or he should not; for he made me mad<br>
To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet<br>
And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman<br>
Of guns and drums and wounds,&#8212;God save the mark!&#8212;<br>
And telling me the sovereign&#8217;st thing on earth<br>
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;<br>
And that it was great pity, so it was,<br>
This villanous salt-petre should be digg&#8217;d<br>
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,<br>
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy&#8217;d<br>
So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,<br>
He would himself have been a soldier.<br>
This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,<br>
I answer&#8217;d indirectly, as I said;<br>
And I beseech you, let not his report<br>
Come current for an accusation<br>
Betwixt my love and your high majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Walter Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">The circumstance consider&#8217;d, good my
lord,<br>
Whate&#8217;er Lord Harry Percy then had said<br>
To such a person and in such a place,<br>
At such a time, with all the rest retold,<br>
May reasonably die and never rise<br>
To do him wrong or any way impeach<br>
What then he said, so he unsay it now.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,<br>
But with proviso and exception,<br>
That we at our own charge shall ransom straight<br>
His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;<br>
Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray&#8217;d<br>
The lives of those that he did lead to fight<br>
Against that great magician, damn&#8217;d Glendower,<br>
Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March<br>
Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,<br>
Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?<br>
Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,<br>
When they have lost and forfeited themselves?<br>
No, on the barren mountains let him starve;<br>
For I shall never hold that man my friend<br>
Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost<br>
To ransom home revolted Mortimer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Revolted Mortimer!<br>
He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,<br>
But by the chance of war; to prove that true<br>
Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,<br>
Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took<br>
When on the gentle Severn&#8217;s sedgy bank,<br>
In single opposition, hand to hand,<br>
He did confound the best part of an hour<br>
In changing hardiment with great Glendower:<br>
Three times they breathed and three times did
they drink,<br>
Upon agreement, of swift Severn&#8217;s flood;<br>
Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,<br>
Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,<br>
And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,<br>
Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.<br>
Never did base and rotten policy<br>
Colour her working with such deadly wounds;<br>
Nor could the noble Mortimer<br>
Receive so many, and all willingly:<br>
Then let not him be slander&#8217;d with revolt.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie
him;<br>
He never did encounter with Glendower:<br>
I tell thee,<br>
He durst as well have met the devil alone<br>
As Owen Glendower for an enemy.<br>
Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth<br>
Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:<br>
Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,<br>
Or you shall hear in such a kind from me<br>
As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,<br>
We licence your departure with your son.<br>
Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and

<p class="speech">An if the devil come and roar for them,<br>
I will not send them: I will after straight<br>
And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,<br>
Albeit I make a hazard of my head.</p>

awhile:<br>
Here comes your uncle.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Worcester</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Speak of Mortimer!<br>
&#8217;Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul<br>
Want mercy, if I do not join with him:<br>
Yea, on his part I&#8217;ll empty all these veins,<br>
And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,<br>
But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer<br>
As high in the air as this unthankful king,<br>
As this ingrate and canker&#8217;d Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Who struck this heat up after I was gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;<br>
And when I urged the ransom once again<br>
Of my wife&#8217;s brother, then his cheek look&#8217;d pale,<br>
And on my face he turn&#8217;d an eye of death,<br>
Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot blame him: was not he
proclaim&#8217;d<br>
By Richard that dead is the next of blood?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">He was; I heard the proclamation:<br>
And then it was when the unhappy king,<br>
&#8212;Whose wrongs in us God pardon!&#8212;did set forth<br>
Upon his Irish expedition;<br>
From whence he intercepted did return<br>
To be deposed and shortly murdered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">And for whose death we in the world&#8217;s wide
mouth<br>
Live scandalized and foully spoken of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then<br>
Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer<br>
Heir to the crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">He did; myself did hear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,<br>
That wished him on the barren mountains starve.<br>
But shall it be that you, that set the crown<br>
Upon the head of this forgetful man<br>
And for his sake wear the detested blot<br>
Of murderous subornation, shall it be,<br>
That you a world of curses undergo,<br>
Being the agents, or base second means,<br>
The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?<br>
O, pardon me that I descend so low,<br>
To show the line and the predicament<br>
Wherein you range under this subtle king;<br>
Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,<br>
Or fill up chronicles in time to come,<br>
That men of your nobility and power<br>
Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,<br>
As both of you&#8212;God pardon it!&#8212;have done,<br>
To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,<br>
An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?<br>
And shall it in more shame be further spoken,<br>
That you are fool&#8217;d, discarded and shook off<br>
By him for whom these shames ye underwent?<br>
No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem<br>
Your banish&#8217;d honours and restore yourselves<br>
Into the good thoughts of the world again,<br>
Revenge the jeering and disdain&#8217;d contempt<br>
Of this proud king, who studies day and night<br>
To answer all the debt he owes to you<br>
Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:<br>
Therefore, I say&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, cousin, say no more:<br>
And now I will unclasp a secret book,<br>
And to your quick-conceiving discontents<br>
I&#8217;ll read you matter deep and dangerous,<br>
As full of peril and adventurous spirit<br>
As to o&#8217;er-walk a current roaring loud<br>
On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:<br>
Send danger from the east unto the west,<br>
So honour cross it from the north to south,<br>
And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs<br>
To rouse a lion than to start a hare!</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Imagination of some great exploit<br>
Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,<br>
To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,<br>
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,<br>
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br>
And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;<br>
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear<br>
Without corrival, all her dignities:<br>
But out upon this half-faced fellowship!</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">He apprehends a world of figures here,<br>
But not the form of what he should attend.<br>
Good cousin, give me audience for a while.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I cry you mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Those same noble Scots<br>
That are your prisoners,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll keep them all;<br>
By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;<br>
No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:<br>
I&#8217;ll keep them, by this hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">You start away<br>
And lend no ear unto my purposes.<br>
Those prisoners you shall keep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I will; that&#8217;s flat:<br>
He said he would not ransom Mortimer;<br>
Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;<br>
But I will find him when he lies asleep,<br>
And in his ear I&#8217;ll holla &#8220;Mortimer!&#8221;<br>
Nay,<br>
I&#8217;ll have a starling shall be taught to speak<br>
Nothing but &#8220;Mortimer,&#8221; and give it him<br>
To keep his anger still in motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Hear you, cousin; a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">All studies here I solemnly defy,<br>
Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:<br>
And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,<br>
But that I think his father loves him not<br>
And would be glad he met with some mischance,<br>
I would have him poison&#8217;d with a pot of ale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, kinsman: I&#8217;ll talk to you<br>
When you are better temper&#8217;d to attend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool<br>
Art thou to break into this woman&#8217;s mood,<br>
Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Why, look you, I am whipp&#8217;d and scourged
with rods,<br>
Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear<br>
Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.<br>
In Richard&#8217;s time,&#8212;what do you call the
place?&#8212;<br>
A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;<br>
&#8217;Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,<br>
His uncle York; where I first bow&#8217;d my knee<br>
Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,&#8212;<br>
&#8217;sblood!&#8212;<br>
When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">At Berkley castle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">You say true:<br>
Why, what a candy deal of courtesy<br>
This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!<br>
Look, &#8220;when his infant fortune came to age,&#8221;<br>
And &#8220;gentle Harry Percy,&#8221; and &#8220;kind
cousin;&#8221;<br>
O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!<br>
Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if you have not, to it again;<br>
We will stay your leisure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I have done, i&#8217; faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.<br>
Deliver them up without their ransom straight,<br>
And make the Douglas&#8217; son your only mean<br>
For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons<br>
Which I shall send you written, be assured,<br>
Will easily be granted. You, my lord,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Northumberland</span></p>
<p class="speech">Your son in Scotland being thus
employ&#8217;d,<br>
Shall secretly into the bosom creep<br>
Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,<br>
The archbishop.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Of York, is it not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">True; who bears hard<br>
His brother&#8217;s death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.<br>
I speak not this in estimation,<br>
As what I think might be, but what I know<br>
Is ruminated, plotted and set down,<br>
And only stays but to behold the face<br>
Of that occasion that shall bring it on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Before the game is afoot, thou still let&#8217;st
slip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;<br>
And then the power of Scotland and of York,<br>
To join with Mortimer, ha?</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">And so they shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, it is exceedingly well aim&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">And &#8217;tis no little reason bids us
speed,<br>
To save our heads by raising of a head;<br>
For, bear ourselves as even as we can,<br>
The king will always think him in our debt,<br>
And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,<br>
Till he hath found a time to pay us home:<br>
And see already how he doth begin<br>
To make us strangers to his looks of love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">He does, he does: we&#8217;ll be revenged on
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, farewell: no further go in this<br>
Than I by letters shall direct your course.<br>
When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,<br>
I&#8217;ll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;<br>
Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,<br>
As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,<br>
To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,<br>
Which now we hold at much uncertainty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I

<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll none of it: I pray thee keep that
for the
hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
as truly as a man of falsehood may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I
hang,
I&#8217;ll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
content to do the profession some grace; that would,
if matters should be looked into, for their own
credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
her their boots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">What, the commonwealth their boots? will she
hold
out water in foul way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">She will, she will; justice hath liquored her.
We
steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
of fern-seed, we walk invisible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding
to
the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in
our
purchase, as I am a true man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false
thief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>

<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">He is walked up to the top of the hill:
I&#8217;ll go seek him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am accursed to rob in that thief&#8217;s
company: the
rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
&#8217;scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
rogue&#8217;s company. If the rascal hath not given me
medicines to make me love him, I&#8217;ll be hanged; it
could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
I&#8217;ll starve ere I&#8217;ll rob a foot further. An
&#8217;twere
not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;

close
to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
of travellers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Have you any levers to lift me up again, being
down?
&#8217;sblood, I&#8217;ll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
again for all the coin in thy father&#8217;s exchequer.
What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?</p>

your house.&#8221; He could be contented: why is he not,
then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
he loves our house. Let me see some more. &#8220;The
purpose you undertake is dangerous;&#8221;&#8212;why,
that&#8217;s
certain: &#8217;tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. &#8220;The
purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
great an opposition.&#8221; Say you so, say you so? I say
unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
you lie. What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
friends true and constant: a good plot, good
friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
general course of action. &#8217;Zounds, an I were now by
this rascal, I could brain him with his lady&#8217;s fan.
Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
next month? and are they not some of them set
forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!

A banish&#8217;d woman from my Harry&#8217;s bed?<br>
Tell me, sweet lord, what is&#8217;t that takes from thee<br>
Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?<br>
Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,<br>
And start so often when thou sit&#8217;st alone?<br>
Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;<br>
And given my treasures and my rights of thee<br>
To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?<br>
In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch&#8217;d,<br>
And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;<br>
Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;<br>
Cry &#8220;Courage! to the field!&#8221; And thou hast
talk&#8217;d<br>
Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,<br>
Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,<br>
Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,<br>
Of prisoners&#8217; ransom and of soldiers slain,<br>
And all the currents of a heady fight.<br>
Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war<br>
And thus hath so bestirr&#8217;d thee in thy sleep,<br>
That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow<br>
Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;<br>
And in thy face strange motions have appear&#8217;d,<br>
Such as we see when men restrain their breath<br>
On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?<br>

They take it already upon their salvation, that
though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king

lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they

am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
that I can drink with any tinker in his own language

much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet

<p class="speaker">Vintner</p>
<p class="speech">What, standest thou still, and hearest such a
calling? Look to the guests within.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Francis</span></p>
<p class="speech">My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more,
are
at the door: shall I let them in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Let them alone awhile, and then open the
door.</p>

<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Anon, anon, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are
at
the door: shall we be merry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye;
what
cunning match have you made with this jest of the
drawer? come, what&#8217;s the issue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I am now of all humours that have showed
themselves
humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
pupil age of this present twelve o&#8217;clock at midnight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Francis</span></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">That ever this fellow should have fewer words
than a
parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy&#8217;s mind, the
Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
hands, and says to his wife &#8220;Fie upon this quiet
life! I want work.&#8221; &#8220;O my sweet Harry,&#8221; says
she,
&#8220;how many hast thou killed to-day?&#8221; &#8220;Give my
roan
horse a drench,&#8221; says he; and answers &#8220;some
fourteen,&#8221; an hour after; &#8220;a trifle, a trifle.&#8221;
I
prithee, call in Falstaff: I&#8217;ll play Percy, and
that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
wife. &#8220;Rivo!&#8221; says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in
tallow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff, Gadshill,
Bardolph, and Peto; Francis following with wine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance
too!
marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
lead this life long, I&#8217;ll sew nether stocks and mend
them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He drinks</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of
butter?
pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
of the sun&#8217;s! if thou didst, then behold that compound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You rogue, here&#8217;s lime in this sack too:
there is
nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
shotten herring. There live not three good men
unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A king&#8217;s son! If I do not beat thee out of
thy
kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
I&#8217;ll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of
Wales!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you whoreson round man, what&#8217;s the
matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and
Poins there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me
coward, by the<br>
Lord, I&#8217;ll stab thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I call thee coward! I&#8217;ll see thee damned
ere I call
thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
back: call you that backing of your friends? A
plague upon such backing! give me them that will
face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
drunk to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since
thou
drunkest last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">All&#8217;s one for that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He drinks</span></p>
<p class="speech">A plague of all cowards, still say I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter! there be four of us here
have
ta&#8217;en a thousand pound this day morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Where is it, Jack? where is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred
upon
poor four of us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What, a hundred, man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with
a
dozen of them two hours together. I have &#8217;scaped by
miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
through and through; my sword hacked like a
hand-saw&#8212;ecce signum! I never dealt better since
I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, sirs; how was it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">We four set upon some dozen&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Sixteen at least, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">And bound them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, they were not bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or
I
am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gadshill</p>
<p class="speech">As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men
set upon us&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And unbound the rest, and then come in the
other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What, fought you with them all?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">All! I know not what you call all; but if I
fought
not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Pray God you have not murdered some of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s past praying for: I have
peppered two
of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What, four? thou saidst but two even now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Four, Hal; I told thee four.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, he said four.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust
at
me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
points in my target, thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Seven? why, there were but four even now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">In buckram?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, four, in buckram suits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain
else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more
anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou hear me, Hal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These
nine
in buckram that I told thee of&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">So, two more already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Their points being broken,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Down fell their hose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Began to give me ground: but I followed me
close,
came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
the eleven I paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of
two!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">But, as the devil would have it, three
misbegotten
knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
not see thy hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">These lies are like their father that begets
them;
gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the
truth
the truth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how couldst thou know these men in
Kendal
green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What, upon compulsion? &#8217;Zounds, an I were
at the
strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
compulsion, I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be no longer guilty of this sin; this
sanguine
coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
this huge hill of flesh,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you
dried
neat&#8217;s tongue, you bull&#8217;s pizzle, you stock-fish! O
for breath to utter what is like thee! you
tailor&#8217;s-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
standing-tuck,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again:
and
when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
hear me speak but this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Mark, Jack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">We two saw you four set on four and bound them,
and
were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
apparent shame?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let&#8217;s hear, Jack; what trick hast
thou now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made
ye.
Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
merry? shall we have a play extempore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Content; and the argument shall be thy running
away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hostess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O Jesu, my lord the prince!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou
to
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court
at
door would speak with you: he says he comes from
your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Give him as much as will make him a royal man,
and
send him back again to my mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What manner of man is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">An old man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight?
Shall<br>
I give him his answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, do, Jack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, and I&#8217;ll send him
packing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sirs: by&#8217;r lady, you fought fair; so
did you,
Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
prince; no, fie!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, I ran when I saw others run.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came
Falstaff&#8217;s
sword so hacked?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he
would
swear truth out of England but he would make you
believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass
to
make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
to hear his monstrous devices.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen
years
ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
instinct hadst thou for it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, do you see these meteors? do you
behold
these exhalations?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">What think you they portend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Hot livers and cold purses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">No, if rightly taken, halter.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.<br>
How now, my sweet creature of bombast!<br>
How long is&#8217;t ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own
knee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I
was
not an eagle&#8217;s talon in the waist; I could have
crept into any alderman&#8217;s thumb-ring: a plague of
sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
bladder. There&#8217;s villanous news abroad: here was
Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
hook&#8212;what a plague call you him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poins</p>
<p class="speech">O, Glendower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law
Mortimer,
and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
Scots, Douglas, that runs o&#8217; horseback up a hill
perpendicular,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">He that rides at high speed and with his
pistol
kills a sparrow flying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">You have hit it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">So did he never the sparrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he
will not run.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him
so
for running!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">O&#8217; horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will
not budge a foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Jack, upon instinct.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there
too,
and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father&#8217;s
beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June
and
this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like
we
shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, i&#8217; faith; I lack some of thy
instinct.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when
thou
comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon
the
particulars of my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I? content: this chair shall be my
state,
this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy
golden
sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
crown for a pitiful bald crown!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of
thee,
now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
in King Cambyses&#8217; vein.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, here is my leg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i&#8217;
faith!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are
vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O, the father, how he holds his countenance!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">For God&#8217;s sake, lords, convey my tristful
queen;<br>
For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these
harlotry
players as ever I see!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good
tickle-brain.
Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
partly thy mother&#8217;s word, partly my own opinion,
but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What manner of man, an it like your majesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A goodly portly man, i&#8217; faith, and a
corpulent; of a
cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
by&#8217;r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
thou been this month?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for
me,
and I&#8217;ll play my father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely,
so
majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter&#8217;s hare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, here I am set.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">And here I stand: judge, my masters.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Harry, whence come you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My noble lord, from Eastcheap.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;sblood, my lord, they are false: nay,
I&#8217;ll tickle
ye for a young prince, i&#8217; faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth
ne&#8217;er look
on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would your grace would take me with you:
whom
means your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">That villanous abominable misleader of youth,<br>
Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the man I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I know thou dost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">But to say I know more harm in him than in
myself,
were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh&#8217;s lean kine
are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
thy Harry&#8217;s company, banish not him thy Harry&#8217;s
company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I do, I will.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Hostess, Francis, and
Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Bardolph,

<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
monstrous watch is at the door.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much
to
say in the behalf of that Falstaff.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter the
Hostess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O Jesu, my lord, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a
fiddlestick:
what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">The sheriff and all the watch are at the door:
they
are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece
of
gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
without seeming so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">And thou a natural coward, without instinct.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I deny your major: if you will deny the
sheriff,
so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk
up
above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
conscience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Both which I have had: but their date is out,
and
therefore I&#8217;ll hide me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Call in the sheriff.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except Prince
Henry and Peto</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sheriff and the
Carrier</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, master sheriff, what is your will with
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry<br>
Hath follow&#8217;d certain men unto this house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What men?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">One of them is well known, my gracious lord,<br>
A gross fat man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Carrier</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;As fat as butter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">The man, I do assure you, is not here;<br>
For I myself at this time have employ&#8217;d him.<br>
And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee<br>
That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,<br>
Send him to answer thee, or any man,<br>
For any thing he shall be charged withal:<br>
And so let me entreat you leave the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen<br>
Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so: if he have robb&#8217;d these
men,<br>
He shall be answerable; and so farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, my noble lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I think it is good morrow, is it not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sheriff</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, I think it be two
o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Sheriff and
Carrier</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">This oily rascal is known as well as
Paul&#8217;s. Go,
call him forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech">Falstaff!&#8212;Fast asleep behind the arras,
and
snorting like a horse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his
pockets.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He searcheth his pockets, and
findeth certain papers</span></p>
<p class="speech">What hast thou found?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but papers, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s see what they be: read them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Peto</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> Item, A

Item, Bread, ob.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread
to
this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
keep close; we&#8217;ll read it at more advantage: there
let him sleep till day. I&#8217;ll to the court in the
morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
shall be honourable. I&#8217;ll procure this fat rogue a
charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hotspur, Worcester,
Mortimer, and Glendower</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">These promises are fair, the parties sure,<br>
And our induction full of prosperous hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,<br>
Will you sit down?<br>
And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!<br>
I have forgot the map.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">No, here it is.<br>
Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,<br>
For by that name as oft as Lancaster<br>
Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with<br>
A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen
Glendower spoke of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot blame him: at my nativity<br>
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,<br>
Of burning cressets; and at my birth<br>
The frame and huge foundation of the earth<br>
Shaked like a coward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so it would have done at the same season,
if
your mother&#8217;s cat had but kittened, though yourself
had never been born.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">I say the earth did shake when I was born.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">And I say the earth was not of my mind,<br>
If you suppose as fearing you it shook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">The heavens were all on fire, the earth did
tremble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on
fire,<br>
And not in fear of your nativity.<br>
Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth<br>
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth<br>
Is with a kind of colic pinch&#8217;d and vex&#8217;d<br>
By the imprisoning of unruly wind<br>
Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,<br>
Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down<br>
Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth<br>
Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,<br>
In passion shook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Cousin, of many men<br>
I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave<br>
To tell you once again that at my birth<br>
The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,<br>
The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds<br>
Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.<br>
These signs have mark&#8217;d me extraordinary;<br>
And all the courses of my life do show<br>
I am not in the roll of common men.<br>
Where is he living, clipp&#8217;d in with the sea<br>
That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,<br>
Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?<br>
And bring him out that is but woman&#8217;s son<br>
Can trace me in the tedious ways of art<br>
And hold me pace in deep experiments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I think there&#8217;s no man speaks better
Welsh.<br>
I&#8217;ll to dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">I can call spirits from the vasty deep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so can I, or so can any man;<br>
But will they come when you do call for them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command<br>
The devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil<br>
By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.<br>
If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.<br>
O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, no more of this unprofitable
chat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head<br>
Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye<br>
And sandy-bottom&#8217;d Severn have I sent him<br>
Bootless home and weather-beaten back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Home without boots, and in foul weather too!<br>
How &#8217;scapes he agues, in the devil&#8217;s name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Come, here&#8217;s the map: shall we divide our
right<br>
According to our threefold order ta&#8217;en?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">The archdeacon hath divided it<br>
Into three limits very equally:<br>
England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,<br>
By south and east is to my part assign&#8217;d:<br>
All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,<br>
And all the fertile land within that bound,<br>
To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you<br>
The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.<br>
And our indentures tripartite are drawn;<br>
Which being sealed interchangeably,<br>
A business that this night may execute,<br>
To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I<br>
And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth<br>
To meet your father and the Scottish power,<br>
As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.<br>
My father Glendower is not ready yet,<br>
Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.<br>
Within that space you may have drawn together<br>
Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:<br>
And in my conduct shall your ladies come;<br>
From whom you now must steal and take no leave,<br>
For there will be a world of water shed<br>
Upon the parting of your wives and you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,<br>
In quantity equals not one of yours:<br>
See how this river comes me cranking in,<br>
And cuts me from the best of all my land<br>
A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.<br>
I&#8217;ll have the current in this place damm&#8217;d up;<br>
And here the smug and silver Trent shall run<br>
In a new channel, fair and evenly;<br>
It shall not wind with such a deep indent,<br>
To rob me of so rich a bottom here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but<br>
Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up<br>
With like advantage on the other side;<br>
Gelding the opposed continent as much<br>
As on the other side it takes from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but a little charge will trench him here<br>
And on this north side win this cape of land;<br>
And then he runs straight and even.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have it so: a little charge will do
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not have it alter&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Will not you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor you shall not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Who shall say me nay?</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that will I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Let me not understand you, then; speak it in
Welsh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">I can speak English, lord, as well as you;<br>
For I was train&#8217;d up in the English court;<br>
Where, being but young, I framed to the harp<br>
Many an English ditty lovely well<br>
And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,<br>
A virtue that was never seen in you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Marry,<br>
And I am glad of it with all my heart:<br>
I had rather be a kitten and cry mew<br>
Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;<br>
I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn&#8217;d,<br>
Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;<br>
And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,<br>
Nothing so much as mincing poetry:<br>
&#8217;Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you shall have Trent turn&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I do not care: I&#8217;ll give thrice so much
land<br>
To any well-deserving friend;<br>
But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,<br>
I&#8217;ll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.<br>
Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">The moon shines fair; you may away by night:<br>
I&#8217;ll haste the writer and withal<br>
Break with your wives of your departure hence:<br>
I am afraid my daughter will run mad,<br>
So much she doteth on her Mortimer.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Glendower</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot choose: sometime he angers me<br>
With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,<br>
Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,<br>
And of a dragon and a finless fish,<br>
A clip-wing&#8217;d griffin and a moulten raven,<br>
A couching lion and a ramping cat,<br>
And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff<br>
As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;<br>
He held me last night at least nine hours<br>
In reckoning up the several devils&#8217; names<br>
That were his lackeys: I cried &#8220;hum,&#8221; and &#8220;well,
go to,&#8221;<br>
But mark&#8217;d him not a word. O, he is as tedious<br>
As a tired horse, a railing wife;<br>
Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live<br>
With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,<br>
Than feed on cates and have him talk to me<br>
In any summer-house in Christendom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,<br>
Exceedingly well read, and profited<br>
In strange concealments, valiant as a lion<br>
And as wondrous affable and as bountiful<br>
As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?<br>
He holds your temper in a high respect<br>
And curbs himself even of his natural scope<br>
When you come &#8217;cross his humour; faith, he does:<br>
I warrant you, that man is not alive<br>
Might so have tempted him as you have done,<br>
Without the taste of danger and reproof:<br>
But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;<br>
And since your coming hither have done enough<br>
To put him quite beside his patience.<br>
You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:<br>
Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,&#8212;<br>
And that&#8217;s the dearest grace it renders you,&#8212;<br>
Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,<br>
Defect of manners, want of government,<br>
Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:<br>
The least of which haunting a nobleman<br>
Loseth men&#8217;s hearts and leaves behind a stain<br>
Upon the beauty of all parts besides,<br>
Beguiling them of commendation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I am school&#8217;d: good manners be your
speed!<br>
Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Glendower with the
ladies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">This is the deadly spite that angers me;<br>
My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter weeps: she will not part with
you;<br>
She&#8217;ll be a soldier too, she&#8217;ll to the wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Good father, tell her that she and my aunt
Percy<br>
Shall follow in your conduct speedily.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Glendower speaks to her in
Welsh, and she answers him in the same</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind
harlotry,
one that no persuasion can do good upon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The lady speaks in
Welsh</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh<br>
Which thou pour&#8217;st down from these swelling heavens<br>
I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,<br>
In such a parley should I answer thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The lady speaks again in
Welsh</span></p>
<p class="speech">I understand thy kisses and thou mine,<br>
And that&#8217;s a feeling disputation:<br>
But I will never be a truant, love,<br>
Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue<br>
Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn&#8217;d,<br>
Sung by a fair queen in a summer&#8217;s bower,<br>
With ravishing division, to her lute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The lady speaks again in
Welsh</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am ignorance itself in this!</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you
down<br>
And rest your gentle head upon her lap,<br>
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you<br>
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.<br>
Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,<br>
Making such difference &#8217;twixt wake and sleep<br>
As is the difference betwixt day and night<br>
The hour before the heavenly-harness&#8217;d team<br>
Begins his golden progress in the east.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart I&#8217;ll sit and hear her
sing:<br>
By that time will our book, I think, be drawn</p>
<p class="speaker">Glendower</p>
<p class="speech">Do so;<br>
And those musicians that shall play to you<br>
Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,<br>
And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down:
come,
quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Go, ye giddy goose.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The music plays</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;<br>
And &#8217;tis no marvel he is so humorous.<br>
By&#8217;r lady, he is a good musician.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Then should you be nothing but musical for you
are
altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
and hear the lady sing in Welsh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in
Irish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst thou have thy head broken?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Then be still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Neither;&#8217;tis a woman&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! she sings.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here the lady sings a Welsh

<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Kate, I&#8217;ll have your song too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Not mine, in good sooth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like

A good mouth-filling oath, and leave &#8220;in sooth,&#8221;<br>

Henry, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and
I<br>
Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,<br>
For we shall presently have need of you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lords</span></p>
<p class="speech">I know not whether God will have it so,<br>
For some displeasing service I have done,<br>
That, in his secret doom, out of my blood<br>
He&#8217;ll breed revengement and a scourge for me;<br>
But thou dost in thy passages of life<br>
Make me believe that thou art only mark&#8217;d<br>
For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven<br>
To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,<br>
Could such inordinate and low desires,<br>
Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,<br>
Such barren pleasures, rude society,<br>
As thou art match&#8217;d withal and grafted to,<br>
Accompany the greatness of thy blood<br>
And hold their level with thy princely heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">So please your majesty, I would I could<br>
Quit all offences with as clear excuse<br>
As well as I am doubtless I can purge<br>
Myself of many I am charged withal:<br>
Yet such extenuation let me beg,<br>
As, in reproof of many tales devised,<br>
which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,<br>
By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,<br>
I may, for some things true, wherein my youth<br>
Hath faulty wander&#8217;d and irregular,<br>
Find pardon on my true submission.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,<br>
At thy affections, which do hold a wing<br>
Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.<br>
Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.<br>
Which by thy younger brother is supplied,<br>
And art almost an alien to the hearts<br>
Of all the court and princes of my blood:<br>
The hope and expectation of thy time<br>
Is ruin&#8217;d, and the soul of every man<br>
Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.<br>
Had I so lavish of my presence been,<br>
So common-hackney&#8217;d in the eyes of men,<br>
So stale and cheap to vulgar company,<br>
Opinion, that did help me to the crown,<br>
Had still kept loyal to possession<br>
And left me in reputeless banishment,<br>
A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.<br>
By being seldom seen, I could not stir<br>
But like a comet I was wonder&#8217;d at;<br>
That men would tell their children &#8220;This is he;&#8221;<br>
Others would say &#8220;Where, which is Bolingbroke?&#8221;<br>
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,<br>
And dress&#8217;d myself in such humility<br>
That I did pluck allegiance from men&#8217;s hearts,<br>
Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,<br>
Even in the presence of the crowned king.<br>
Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;<br>
My presence, like a robe pontifical,<br>
Ne&#8217;er seen but wonder&#8217;d at: and so my state,<br>
Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast<br>
And won by rareness such solemnity.<br>
The skipping king, he ambled up and down<br>
With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,<br>
Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,<br>
Mingled his royalty with capering fools,<br>
Had his great name profaned with their scorns<br>
And gave his countenance, against his name,<br>
To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push<br>
Of every beardless vain comparative,<br>
Grew a companion to the common streets,<br>
Enfeoff&#8217;d himself to popularity;<br>
That, being daily swallow&#8217;d by men&#8217;s eyes,<br>
They surfeited with honey and began<br>
To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little<br>
More than a little is by much too much.<br>
So when he had occasion to be seen,<br>
He was but as the cuckoo is in June,<br>
Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes<br>
As, sick and blunted with community,<br>
Afford no extraordinary gaze,<br>
Such as is bent on sun-like majesty<br>
When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;<br>
But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,<br>
Slept in his face and render&#8217;d such aspect<br>
As cloudy men use to their adversaries,<br>
Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.<br>
And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;<br>
For thou has lost thy princely privilege<br>
With vile participation: not an eye<br>
But is a-weary of thy common sight,<br>
Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;<br>
Which now doth that I would not have it do,<br>
Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,<br>
Be more myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;For all the world<br>
As thou art to this hour was Richard then<br>
When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,<br>
And even as I was then is Percy now.<br>
Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,<br>
He hath more worthy interest to the state<br>
Than thou the shadow of succession;<br>
For of no right, nor colour like to right,<br>
He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,<br>
Turns head against the lion&#8217;s armed jaws,<br>
And, being no more in debt to years than thou,<br>
Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on<br>
To bloody battles and to bruising arms.<br>
What never-dying honour hath he got<br>
Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,<br>
Whose hot incursions and great name in arms<br>
Holds from all soldiers chief majority<br>
And military title capital<br>
Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:<br>
Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,<br>
This infant warrior, in his enterprises<br>
Discomfited great Douglas, ta&#8217;en him once,<br>
Enlarged him and made a friend of him,<br>
To fill the mouth of deep defiance up<br>
And shake the peace and safety of our throne.<br>
And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,<br>
The Archbishop&#8217;s grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,<br>
Capitulate against us and are up.<br>
But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?<br>
Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,<br>
Which art my near&#8217;st and dearest enemy?<br>
Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,<br>
Base inclination and the start of spleen<br>
To fight against me under Percy&#8217;s pay,<br>
To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,<br>
To show how much thou art degenerate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Do not think so; you shall not find it so:<br>
And God forgive them that so much have sway&#8217;d<br>
Your majesty&#8217;s good thoughts away from me!<br>
I will redeem all this on Percy&#8217;s head<br>
And in the closing of some glorious day<br>
Be bold to tell you that I am your son;<br>
When I will wear a garment all of blood<br>
And stain my favours in a bloody mask,<br>
Which, wash&#8217;d away, shall scour my shame with it:<br>
And that shall be the day, whene&#8217;er it lights,<br>
That this same child of honour and renown,<br>
This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,<br>
And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.<br>
For every honour sitting on his helm,<br>
Would they were multitudes, and on my head<br>
My shames redoubled! for the time will come,<br>
That I shall make this northern youth exchange<br>
His glorious deeds for my indignities.<br>
Percy is but my factor, good my lord,<br>
To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;<br>
And I will call him to so strict account,<br>
That he shall render every glory up,<br>
Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,<br>
Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.<br>
This, in the name of God, I promise here:<br>
The which if He be pleased I shall perform,<br>
I do beseech your majesty may salve<br>
The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:<br>
If not, the end of life cancels all bands;<br>

Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this
last
action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
skin hangs about me like an like an old lady&#8217;s loose
gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
I&#8217;ll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
am a peppercorn, a brewer&#8217;s horse: the inside of a
church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
spoil of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song;
make
me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
in a quarter&#8212;of an hour; paid money that I
borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
of all compass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must
needs
be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
compass, Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Do thou amend thy face, and I&#8217;ll amend my
life:
thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
the poop, but &#8217;tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
Knight of the Burning Lamp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll be sworn; I make as good use of it
as many
a man doth of a Death&#8217;s-head or a memento mori: I
never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
should be &#8220;By this fire, that&#8217;s God&#8217;s
angel:&#8221; but
thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
for the light in thy face, the son of utter
darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
there&#8217;s no purchase in money. O, thou art a
perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
at the dearest chandler&#8217;s in Europe. I have
maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;sblood, I would my face were in your

<p class="speech">How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you
inquired
yet who picked my pocket?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do
you
think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
was never lost in my house before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost
many
a hair; and I&#8217;ll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
to, you are a woman, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Who, I? no; I defy thee: God&#8217;s light, I was
never
called so in mine own house before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, I know you well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I
know
you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
you a dozen of shirts to your back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away
to
bakers&#8217; wives, and they have made bolters of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
you, four and twenty pound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">He had his part of it; let him pay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">How! poor? look upon his face; what call you
rich?
let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
seal-ring of my grandfather&#8217;s worth forty mark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know
not
how oft, that ring was copper!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup:
&#8217;sblood, an
he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
would say so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince Henry and Peto,
marching, and Falstaff meets them playing on his truncheon like a

<p class="speech">How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i&#8217;
faith?
must we all march?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I pray you, hear me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth
thy
husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, hear me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What sayest thou, Jack?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">The other night I fell asleep here behind the
arras
and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
bawdy-house; they pick pockets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What didst thou lose, Jack?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds
of
forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
grandfather&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard
your
grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
he would cudgel you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">What! he did not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s neither faith, truth, nor womanhood
in me else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no more faith in thee than in a
stewed
prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
deputy&#8217;s wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
go</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Say, what thing? what thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
shouldst know it; I am an honest man&#8217;s wife: and,
setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
call me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to
say
otherwise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What beast! why, an otter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she&#8217;s neither fish nor flesh; a man
knows not
where to have her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or
any
man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee
most grossly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day
you
ought him a thousand pound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is
worth
a million: thou owest me thy love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he
would
cudgel you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Did I, Bardolph?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I say &#8217;tis copper: darest thou be as good
as thy word now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I
dare:
but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
roaring of a lion&#8217;s whelp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">And why not as the lion?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">The king is to be feared as the lion: dost
thou
think I&#8217;ll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
I do, I pray God my girdle break.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about
thy
knees! But, sirrah, there&#8217;s no room for faith,
truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state
of
innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">It appears so by the story.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready
breakfast;
love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
prithee, be gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hostess</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now Hal, to the news at court: for the
robbery,
lad, how is that answered?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel
to
thee: the money is paid back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">O, I do not like that paying back; &#8217;tis a
double labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I am good friends with my father and may do any
thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest,
and
do it with unwashed hands too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Do, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would it had been of horse. Where shall I
find
one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I

<h4>Scene I. The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hotspur, Worcester, and
Douglas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth<br>
In this fine age were not thought flattery,<br>
Such attribution should the Douglas have,<br>
As not a soldier of this season&#8217;s stamp<br>
Should go so general current through the world.<br>
By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy<br>
The tongues of soothers; but a braver place<br>
In my heart&#8217;s love hath no man than yourself:<br>
Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Douglas</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art the king of honour:<br>
No man so potent breathes upon the ground<br>
But I will beard him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, and &#8217;tis well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger with
letters</span></p>
<p class="speech">What letters hast thou there?&#8212;I can but
thank you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">These letters come from your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Letters from him! why comes he not himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds! how has he the leisure to be
sick<br>
In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?<br>
Under whose government come they along?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;<br>
And at the time of my departure thence<br>
He was much fear&#8217;d by his physicians.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">I would the state of time had first been
whole<br>
Ere he by sickness had been visited:<br>
His health was never better worth than now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth
infect<br>
The very life-blood of our enterprise;<br>
&#8217;Tis catching hither, even to our camp.<br>
He writes me here, that inward sickness&#8212;<br>
And that his friends by deputation could not<br>
So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet<br>
To lay so dangerous and dear a trust<br>
On any soul removed but on his own.<br>
Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,<br>
That with our small conjunction we should on,<br>
To see how fortune is disposed to us;<br>
For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.<br>
Because the king is certainly possess&#8217;d<br>
Of all our purposes. What say you to it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Your father&#8217;s sickness is a maim to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">A perilous gash, a very limb lopp&#8217;d
off:<br>
And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want<br>
Seems more than we shall find it: were it good<br>
To set the exact wealth of all our states<br>
All at one cast? to set so rich a main<br>
On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?<br>
It were not good; for therein should we read<br>
The very bottom and the soul of hope,<br>
The very list, the very utmost bound<br>
Of all our fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Douglas</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, and so we should;<br>
Where now remains a sweet reversion:<br>
We may boldly spend upon the hope of what<br>
Is to come in:<br>
A comfort of retirement lives in this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.<br>
If that the devil and mischance look big<br>
Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">But yet I would your father had been here.<br>
The quality and hair of our attempt<br>
Brooks no division: it will be thought<br>
By some, that know not why he is away,<br>
That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike<br>
Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:<br>
And think how such an apprehension<br>
May turn the tide of fearful faction<br>
And breed a kind of question in our cause;<br>
For well you know we of the offering side<br>
Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,<br>
And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence<br>
The eye of reason may pry in upon us:<br>
This absence of your father&#8217;s draws a curtain,<br>
That shows the ignorant a kind of fear<br>
Before not dreamt of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">You strain too far.<br>
I rather of his absence make this use:<br>
It lends a lustre and more great opinion,<br>
A larger dare to our great enterprise,<br>
Than if the earl were here; for men must think,<br>
If we without his help can make a head<br>
To push against a kingdom, with his help<br>
We shall o&#8217;erturn it topsy-turvy down.<br>
Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Douglas</p>
<p class="speech">As heart can think: there is not such a word<br>
Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Richard
Vernon</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.<br>
The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,<br>
Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">No harm: what more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">And further, I have learn&#8217;d,<br>
The king himself in person is set forth,<br>
Or hitherwards intended speedily,<br>
With strong and mighty preparation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,<br>
The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,<br>
And his comrades, that daff&#8217;d the world aside,<br>
And bid it pass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;All furnish&#8217;d, all in
arms;<br>
All plumed like estridges that with the wind<br>
Baited like eagles having lately bathed;<br>
Glittering in golden coats, like images;<br>
As full of spirit as the month of May,<br>
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;<br>
Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.<br>
I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,<br>
His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm&#8217;d<br>
Rise from the ground like feather&#8217;d Mercury,<br>
And vaulted with such ease into his seat,<br>
As if an angel dropp&#8217;d down from the clouds,<br>
To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus<br>
And witch the world with noble horsemanship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">No more, no more: worse than the sun in
March,<br>
This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:<br>
They come like sacrifices in their trim,<br>
And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war<br>
All hot and bleeding will we offer them:<br>
The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit<br>
Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire<br>
To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh<br>
And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,<br>
Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt<br>
Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:<br>
Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,<br>
Meet and ne&#8217;er part till one drop down a corse.<br>
O that Glendower were come!</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">There is more news:<br>
I learn&#8217;d in Worcester, as I rode along,<br>
He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Douglas</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s the worst tidings that I hear of
yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">What may the king&#8217;s whole battle reach
unto?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">To thirty thousand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Forty let it be:<br>
My father and Glendower being both away,<br>
The powers of us may serve so great a day<br>
Come, let us take a muster speedily:<br>
Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Douglas</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not of dying: I am out of fear<br>
Of death or death&#8217;s hand for this one-half year.</p>

Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me
a
bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
we&#8217;ll to Sutton Co&#8217;fil&#8217; tonight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Will you give me money, captain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Lay out, lay out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">This bottle makes an angel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a
soused
gurnet. I have misused the king&#8217;s press damnably.
I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good house-holders, yeoman&#8217;s sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
bigger than pins&#8217; heads, and they have bought out
their services; and now my whole charge consists of
ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
painted cloth, where the glutton&#8217;s dogs licked his
sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
the rooms of them that have bought out their
services, that you would think that I had a hundred
and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
hath seen such scarecrows. I&#8217;ll not march through
Coventry with them, that&#8217;s flat: nay, and the
villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
prison. There&#8217;s but a shirt and a half in all my
company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
together and thrown over the shoulders like an
herald&#8217;s coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban&#8217;s, or
the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that&#8217;s all
one; they&#8217;ll find linen enough on every hedge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Prince and
Westmoreland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost
thou
in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
at Shrewsbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, Sir John,&#8217;tis more than time that I
were
there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
away all night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat
to
steal cream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft
hath
already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
fellows are these that come after?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I did never see such pitiful rascals.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder,
food
for powder; they&#8217;ll fill a pit as well as better:
tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding
poor
and bare, too beggarly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, for their poverty, I know not where
they had
that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
learned that of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">No I&#8217;ll be sworn; unless you call three
fingers on
the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
already in the field.</p>

Being men of such great leading as you are,<br>
That you foresee not what impediments<br>
Drag back our expedition: certain horse<br>
Of my cousin Vernon&#8217;s are not yet come up:<br>
Your uncle Worcester&#8217;s horse came but today;<br>
And now their pride and mettle is asleep,<br>
Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,<br>
That not a horse is half the half of himself.</p>

In general, journey-bated and brought low:<br>

<p class="speech">Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God<br>
You were of our determination!<br>
Some of us love you well; and even those some<br>
Envy your great deservings and good name,<br>
Because you are not of our quality,<br>
But stand against us like an enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Walter Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">And God defend but still I should stand so,<br>
So long as out of limit and true rule<br>
You stand against anointed majesty.<br>
But to my charge. The king hath sent to know<br>
The nature of your griefs, and whereupon<br>
You conjure from the breast of civil peace<br>
Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land<br>
Audacious cruelty. If that the king<br>
Have any way your good deserts forgot,<br>
Which he confesseth to be manifold,<br>
He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed<br>
You shall have your desires with interest<br>
And pardon absolute for yourself and these<br>
Herein misled by your suggestion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">The king is kind; and well we know the king<br>
Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.<br>
My father and my uncle and myself<br>
Did give him that same royalty he wears;<br>
And when he was not six and twenty strong,<br>
Sick in the world&#8217;s regard, wretched and low,<br>
A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,<br>
My father gave him welcome to the shore;<br>
And when he heard him swear and vow to God<br>
He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,<br>
To sue his livery and beg his peace,<br>
With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,<br>
My father, in kind heart and pity moved,<br>
Swore him assistance and perform&#8217;d it too.<br>
Now when the lords and barons of the realm<br>
Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,<br>
The more and less came in with cap and knee;<br>
Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,<br>
Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,<br>
Laid gifts before him, proffer&#8217;d him their oaths,<br>
Gave him their heirs, as pages follow&#8217;d him<br>
Even at the heels in golden multitudes.<br>
He presently, as greatness knows itself,<br>
Steps me a little higher than his vow<br>
Made to my father, while his blood was poor,<br>
Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;<br>
And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform<br>
Some certain edicts and some strait decrees<br>
That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,<br>
Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep<br>
Over his country&#8217;s wrongs; and by this face,<br>
This seeming brow of justice, did he win<br>
The hearts of all that he did angle for;<br>
Proceeded further; cut me off the heads<br>
Of all the favourites that the absent king<br>
In deputation left behind him here,<br>
When he was personal in the Irish war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Walter Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I came not to hear this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Then to the point.<br>
In short time after, he deposed the king;<br>
Soon after that, deprived him of his life;<br>
And in the neck of that, task&#8217;d the whole state:<br>
To make that worse, suffer&#8217;d his kinsman March,<br>
Who is, if every owner were well placed,<br>
Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,<br>
There without ransom to lie forfeited;<br>
Disgraced me in my happy victories,<br>
Sought to entrap me by intelligence;<br>
Rated mine uncle from the council-board;<br>
In rage dismiss&#8217;d my father from the court;<br>
Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,<br>
And in conclusion drove us to seek out<br>
This head of safety; and withal to pry<br>
Into his title, the which we find<br>
Too indirect for long continuance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Walter Blunt</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I return this answer to the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, Sir Walter: we&#8217;ll withdraw
awhile.<br>
Go to the king; and let there be impawn&#8217;d<br>
Some surety for a safe return again,<br>
And in the morning early shall my uncle<br>
Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</p>

Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men<br>

Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,<br>

Whose power was in the first proportion,<br>
And what with Owen Glendower&#8217;s absence thence,<br>
Who with them was a rated sinew too<br>

For he hath heard of our confederacy,<br>

<p class="speech">How now, my Lord of Worcester! &#8217;tis not
well<br>
That you and I should meet upon such terms<br>
As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,<br>
And made us doff our easy robes of peace,<br>
To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:<br>
This is not well, my lord, this is not well.<br>
What say you to it? will you again unknit<br>
This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?<br>
And move in that obedient orb again<br>
Where you did give a fair and natural light,<br>
And be no more an exhaled meteor,<br>
A prodigy of fear and a portent<br>
Of broached mischief to the unborn times?</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, my liege:<br>
For mine own part, I could be well content<br>
To entertain the lag-end of my life<br>
With quiet hours; for I do protest,<br>
I have not sought the day of this dislike.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">You have not sought it! how comes it, then?</p>

<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, chewet, peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">It pleased your majesty to turn your looks<br>
Of favour from myself and all our house;<br>
And yet I must remember you, my lord,<br>
We were the first and dearest of your friends.<br>
For you my staff of office did I break<br>
In Richard&#8217;s time; and posted day and night<br>
To meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,<br>
When yet you were in place and in account<br>
Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.<br>
It was myself, my brother and his son,<br>
That brought you home and boldly did outdare<br>
The dangers of the time. You swore to us,<br>
And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,<br>
That you did nothing purpose &#8217;gainst the state;<br>
Nor claim no further than your new-fall&#8217;n right,<br>
The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:<br>
To this we swore our aid. But in short space<br>
It rain&#8217;d down fortune showering on your head;<br>
And such a flood of greatness fell on you,<br>
What with our help, what with the absent king,<br>
What with the injuries of a wanton time,<br>
The seeming sufferances that you had borne,<br>
And the contrarious winds that held the king<br>
So long in his unlucky Irish wars<br>
That all in England did repute him dead:<br>
And from this swarm of fair advantages<br>
You took occasion to be quickly woo&#8217;d<br>
To gripe the general sway into your hand;<br>
Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;<br>
And being fed by us you used us so<br>
As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo&#8217;s bird,<br>
Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;<br>
Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk<br>
That even our love durst not come near your sight<br>
For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing<br>
We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly<br>
Out of sight and raise this present head;<br>
Whereby we stand opposed by such means<br>
As you yourself have forged against yourself<br>
By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,<br>
And violation of all faith and troth<br>
Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">These things indeed you have articulate,<br>
Proclaim&#8217;d at market-crosses, read in churches,<br>
To face the garment of rebellion<br>
With some fine colour that may please the eye<br>
Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,<br>
Which gape and rub the elbow at the news<br>
Of hurlyburly innovation:<br>
And never yet did insurrection want<br>
Such water-colours to impaint his cause;<br>
Nor moody beggars, starving for a time<br>
Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">In both your armies there is many a soul<br>
Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,<br>
If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,<br>
The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world<br>
In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,<br>
This present enterprise set off his head,<br>
I do not think a braver gentleman,<br>
More active-valiant or more valiant-young,<br>
More daring or more bold, is now alive<br>
To grace this latter age with noble deeds.<br>
For my part, I may speak it to my shame,<br>
I have a truant been to chivalry;<br>
And so I hear he doth account me too;<br>
Yet this before my father&#8217;s majesty&#8212;<br>
I am content that he shall take the odds<br>
Of his great name and estimation,<br>
And will, to save the blood on either side,<br>
Try fortune with him in a single fight.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture
thee,<br>
Albeit considerations infinite<br>
Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,<br>
We love our people well; even those we love<br>
That are misled upon your cousin&#8217;s part;<br>
And, will they take the offer of our grace,<br>
Both he and they and you, every man<br>
Shall be my friend again and I&#8217;ll be his:<br>
So tell your cousin, and bring me word<br>
What he will do: but if he will not yield,<br>
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us<br>
And they shall do their office. So, be gone;<br>
We will not now be troubled with reply:<br>
We offer fair; take it advisedly.</p>

Say thy prayers, and farewell.</p>

<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay

calls not on me? Well, &#8217;tis no matter; honour pricks
me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
he that died o&#8217; Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
Doth he hear it? no. &#8217;Tis insensible, then. Yea,
to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
I&#8217;ll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
ends my catechism.</p>

Making you ever better than his praise<br>
By still dispraising praise valued in you;<br>

<p class="speech">Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come<br>
To end the one of us; and would to God<br>
Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll make it greater ere I part from
thee;<br>
And all the budding honours on thy crest<br>
I&#8217;ll crop, to make a garland for my head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">I can no longer brook thy vanities.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find
no
boy&#8217;s play here, I can tell you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Douglas; he fights
with Falstaff, who falls down as if he were dead, and exit Douglas.
Hotspur is wounded, and falls</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hotspur</p>
<p class="speech">O, Harry, thou hast robb&#8217;d me of my
youth!<br>
I better brook the loss of brittle life<br>
Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;<br>
They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:<br>
But thought&#8217;s the slave of life, and life time&#8217;s
fool;<br>
And time, that takes survey of all the world,<br>
Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,<br>
But that the earthy and cold hand of death<br>
Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust<br>
And food for&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great
heart!<br>
Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!<br>
When that this body did contain a spirit,<br>
A kingdom for it was too small a bound;<br>
But now two paces of the vilest earth<br>
Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead<br>
Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.<br>
If thou wert sensible of courtesy,<br>
I should not make so dear a show of zeal:<br>
But let my favours hide thy mangled face;<br>
And, even in thy behalf, I&#8217;ll thank myself<br>
For doing these fair rites of tenderness.<br>
Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!<br>
Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,<br>
But not remember&#8217;d in thy epitaph!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He spieth Falstaff on the
ground</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, old acquaintance! could not all this
flesh<br>
Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!<br>
I could have better spared a better man:<br>
O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,<br>
If I were much in love with vanity!<br>
Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,<br>
Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.<br>
Embowell&#8217;d will I see thee by and by:<br>
Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Prince Henry</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Rising up]</span>
Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
I&#8217;ll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
to-morrow. &#8217;sblood,&#8217;twas time to counterfeit, or
that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
valour is discretion; in the which better part I
have saved my life.&#8217;Zounds, I am afraid of this
gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
Therefore I&#8217;ll make him sure; yea, and I&#8217;ll swear I
killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
Therefore, sirrah,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabbing him</span></p>
<p class="speech">with a new wound in your thigh, come you along
with me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Takes up Hotspur on his
back</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Prince Henry and
Lord John Of Lancaster</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou
flesh&#8217;d<br>
Thy maiden sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But, soft! whom have we here?<br>
Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">I did; I saw him dead,<br>
Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
thou alive?<br>
Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?<br>
I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes<br>
Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem&#8217;st.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, that&#8217;s certain; I am not a double man:
but if I
be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throwing the body
down</span></p>
<p class="speech">if your father will do me any honour, so; if not,
let
him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
earl or duke, I can assure you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given
to
lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I&#8217;ll take
it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
&#8217;zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">This is the strangest fellow, brother John.<br>
Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:<br>
For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,<br>
I&#8217;ll gild it with the happiest terms I have.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A retreat is
sounded</span></p>
<p class="speech">The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.<br>
Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,<br>
To see what friends are living, who are dead.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Prince Henry and
Lancaster</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll follow, as they say, for reward. He
that
rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
I&#8217;ll grow less; for I&#8217;ll purge, and leave sack, and
live cleanly as a nobleman should do.</p>

<h4>Scene V. Another part of the field.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The trumpets sound. Enter
King Henry IV, Prince Henry, Lord John Lancaster, Earl Of
Westmoreland, with Worcester and Vernon prisoners</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.<br>
Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,<br>
Pardon and terms of love to all of you?<br>
And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?<br>
Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman&#8217;s trust?<br>
Three knights upon our party slain to-day,<br>
A noble earl and many a creature else<br>
Had been alive this hour,<br>
If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne<br>
Betwixt our armies true intelligence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Earl Of Worcester</p>
<p class="speech">What I have done my safety urged me to;<br>
And I embrace this fortune patiently,<br>
Since not to be avoided it falls on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:<br>
Other offenders we will pause upon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Worcester and Vernon,
guarded</span></p>
<p class="speech">How goes the field?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw<br>
The fortune of the day quite turn&#8217;d from him,<br>
The noble Percy slain, and all his men<br>
Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;<br>
And falling from a hill, he was so bruised<br>
That the pursuers took him. At my tent<br>
The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace<br>
I may dispose of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Henry</p>
<p class="speech">Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you<br>
This honourable bounty shall belong:<br>
Go to the Douglas, and deliver him<br>
Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:<br>
His valour shown upon our crests to-day<br>
Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds<br>
Even in the bosom of our adversaries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lancaster</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your grace for this high courtesy,<br>
Which I shall give away immediately.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry IV</p>
<p class="speech">Then this remains, that we divide our power.<br>
You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland<br>
Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,<br>
To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,<br>
Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:<br>
Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,<br>
To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.<br>
Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,<br>
Meeting the cheque of such another day:<br>
And since this business so fair is done,<br>
Let us not leave till all our own be won.</p>
