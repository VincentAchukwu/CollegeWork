<h4>Scene I. London. The Parliament-house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter King Henry
VI, Exeter, Gloucester, Warwick, Somerset, and Suffolk; the Bishop
Of Winchester, Richard Plantagenet, and others. Gloucester offers
to put up a bill; Bishop Of Winchester snatches it, and tears
it</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,<br>
With written pamphlets studiously devised,<br>
Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,<br>
Or aught intend&#8217;st to lay unto my charge,<br>
Do it without invention, suddenly;<br>
As I with sudden and extemporal speech<br>
Purpose to answer what thou canst object.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Presumptuous priest! this place commands my
patience,<br>
Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour&#8217;d me.<br>
Think not, although in writing I preferr&#8217;d<br>
The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,<br>
That therefore I have forged, or am not able<br>
Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:<br>
No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,<br>
Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,<br>
As very infants prattle of thy pride.<br>
Thou art a most pernicious usurer,<br>
Forward by nature, enemy to peace;<br>
Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems<br>
A man of thy profession and degree;<br>
And for thy treachery, what&#8217;s more manifest?<br>
In that thou laid&#8217;st a trap to take my life,<br>
As well at London bridge as at the Tower.<br>
Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,<br>
The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt<br>
From envious malice of thy swelling heart.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe<br>
To give me hearing what I shall reply.<br>
If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,<br>
As he will have me, how am I so poor?<br>
Or how haps it I seek not to advance<br>
Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?<br>
And for dissension, who preferreth peace<br>
More than I do?&#8212;except I be provoked.<br>
No, my good lords, it is not that offends;<br>
It is not that that hath incensed the duke:<br>
It is, because no one should sway but he;<br>
No one but he should be about the king;<br>
And that engenders thunder in his breast<br>
And makes him roar these accusations forth.<br>
But he shall know I am as good&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">As good!<br>
Thou bastard of my grandfather!<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,<br>
But one imperious in another&#8217;s throne?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not protector, saucy priest?<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">And am not I a prelate of the church?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps<br>
And useth it to patronage his theft.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Unreverent Gloster!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art reverent<br>
Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Rome shall remedy this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Roam thither, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, it were your duty to forbear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks my lord should be religious<br>
And know the office that belongs to such.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, when his holy state is touch&#8217;d so
near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">State holy or unhallow&#8217;d, what of that?<br>
Is not his grace protector to the king?<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Plantagenet, I
see, must hold his tongue,<br>
Lest it be said &#8216;speak, sirrah, when you should;<br>
Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?&#8217;<br>
Else would I have a fling at Winchester.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,<br>
The special watchmen of our English weal,<br>
I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,<br>
To join your hearts in love and amity.<br>
O, what a scandal is it to our crown,<br>
That two such noble peers as ye should jar!<br>
Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell<br>
Civil dissension is a viperous worm<br>
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A noise within, &#8216;Down
with the tawny-coats!&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="speech">What tumult&#8217;s this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">An uproar, I dare warrant,<br>
Begun through malice of the bishop&#8217;s men.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A noise again, &#8216;stones!
stones!&#8217; Enter Mayor</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,<br>
Pity the city of London, pity us!<br>
The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s men,<br>
Forbidden late to carry any weapon,<br>
Have fill&#8217;d their pockets full of pebble stones<br>
And banding themselves in contrary parts<br>
Do pelt so fast at one another&#8217;s pate<br>
That many have their giddy brains knock&#8217;d out:<br>
Our windows are broke down in every street<br>
And we for fear compell&#8217;d to shut our shops.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Serving-men, in
skirmish, with bloody pates</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,<br>
To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.<br>
Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.<br>
<p class="speaker">First Serving-man
<p class="speech">Nay, if we be forbidden stones,<br>
We&#8217;ll fall to it with our teeth.<br>
<p class="speaker">Second Serving-man
<p class="speech">Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Skirmish again</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">You of my household, leave this peevish broil<br>
And set this unaccustom&#8217;d fight aside.<br>
<p class="speaker">Third Serving-man
<p class="speech">My lord, we know your grace to be a man<br>
Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,<br>
Inferior to none but to his majesty:<br>
And ere that we will suffer such a prince,<br>
So kind a father of the commonweal,<br>
To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,<br>
We and our wives and children all will fight<br>
And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.<br>
<p class="speaker">First Serving-man
<p class="speech">Ay, and the very parings of our nails<br>
Shall pitch a field when we are dead.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Begin again</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, stay, I say!<br>
And if you love me, as you say you do,<br>
Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!<br>
Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold<br>
My sighs and tears and will not once relent?<br>
Who should be pitiful, if you be not?<br>
Or who should study to prefer a peace.<br>
If holy churchmen take delight in broils?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;<br>
Except you mean with obstinate repulse<br>
To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.<br>
You see what mischief and what murder too<br>
Hath been enacted through your enmity;<br>
Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">He shall submit, or I will never yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Compassion on the king commands me stoop;<br>
Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest<br>
Should ever get that privilege of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke<br>
Hath banish&#8217;d moody discontented fury,<br>
As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:<br>
Why look you still so stern and tragical?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach<br>
That malice was a great and grievous sin;<br>
And will not you maintain the thing you teach,<br>
But prove a chief offender in the same?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.<br>
For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!<br>
What, shall a child instruct you what to do?<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to
thee;<br>
Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Ay, but, I
fear me, with a hollow heart.&#8212;<br>
See here, my friends and loving countrymen,<br>
This token serveth for a flag of truce<br>
Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:<br>
So help me God, as I dissemble not!<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> So help me
God, as I intend it not!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,<br>
How joyful am I made by this contract!<br>
Away, my masters! trouble us no more;<br>
But join in friendship, as your lords have done.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Serving-man</p>
<p class="speech">Content: I&#8217;ll to the surgeon&#8217;s.<br>
<p class="speaker">Second Serving-man</p>
<p class="speech">And so will I.<br>
<p class="speaker">Third Serving-man</p>
<p class="speech">And I will see what physic the tavern
affords.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor,
&amp;c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,<br>
Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet<br>
We do exhibit to your majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet
prince,<br>
And if your grace mark every circumstance,<br>
You have great reason to do Richard right;<br>
Especially for those occasions<br>
At Eltham Place I told your majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And those occasions, uncle, were of force:<br>
Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is<br>
That Richard be restored to his blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Let Richard be restored to his blood;<br>
So shall his father&#8217;s wrongs be recompensed.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">If Richard will be true, not that alone<br>
But all the whole inheritance I give<br>
That doth belong unto the house of York,<br>
From whence you spring by lineal descent.<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">Thy humble servant vows obedience<br>
And humble service till the point of death.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;<br>
And, in reguerdon of that duty done,<br>
I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:<br>
Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,<br>
And rise created princely Duke of York.<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!<br>
And as my duty springs, so perish they<br>
That grudge one thought against your majesty!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of
York!</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Perish, base
prince, ignoble Duke of York!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now will it best avail your majesty<br>
To cross the seas and to be crown&#8217;d in France:<br>
The presence of a king engenders love<br>
Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,<br>
As it disanimates his enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">When Gloucester says the word, King Henry
goes;<br>
For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your ships already are in readiness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all
but Exeter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, we may march in England or in France,<br>
Not seeing what is likely to ensue.<br>
This late dissension grown betwixt the peers<br>
Burns under feigned ashes of forged love<br>
And will at last break out into a flame:<br>
As fester&#8217;d members rot but by degree,<br>
Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,<br>
So will this base and envious discord breed.<br>
And now I fear that fatal prophecy<br>
Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth<br>
Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;<br>
That Henry born at Monmouth should win all<br>
And Henry born at Windsor lose all:<br>
Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish<br>
His days may finish ere that hapless time.</p>

<h4>Scene II. France. Before Rouen.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Joan La Pucelle
disguised, with four Soldiers with sacks upon their
backs</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,<br>
Through which our policy must make a breach:<br>
Take heed, be wary how you place your words;<br>
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men<br>
That come to gather money for their corn.<br>
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,<br>
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,<br>
I&#8217;ll by a sign give notice to our friends,<br>
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,<br>
And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;<br>
Therefore we&#8217;ll knock.</p>

<p class="speech">Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Rouen, I&#8217;ll shake thy bulwarks to the
ground.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

Orleans, Alencon, Reignier, and forces</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>

practisants;<br>
Now she is there, how will she specify<br>
Where is the best and safest passage in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;<br>
Which, once discern&#8217;d, shows that her meaning is,<br>
No way to that, for weakness, which she enter&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Joan La Pucelle on the
top, thrusting out a torch burning</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>

That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,<br>
But burning fatal to the Talbotites!</p>

Bedford, brought in sick in a chair. Enter Talbot and Burgundy
without: within Joan La Pucelle, Charles, Bastard Of Orleans,
Alencon, and Reignier, on the walls</span></p>

<p class="speech">Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for
bread?<br>
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast<br>
Before he&#8217;ll buy again at such a rate:<br>
&#8217;Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>

I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own<br>
And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.</p>

lance,<br>
And run a tilt at death within a chair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,<br>
Encompass&#8217;d with thy lustful paramours!<br>
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age<br>
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?<br>
Damsel, I&#8217;ll have a bout with you again,<br>
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy
peace;<br>

To try if that our own be ours or no.</p>

But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;<br>
Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Signior, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Signior, hang! base muleters of France!<br>
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls<br>
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.</p>

Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,<br>
Prick&#8217;d on by public wrongs sustain&#8217;d in France,<br>
Either to get the town again or die:<br>
And I, as sure as English Henry lives<br>
And as his father here was conqueror,<br>
As sure as in this late-betrayed town<br>
Great Coeur-de-lion&#8217;s heart was buried,<br>
So sure I swear to get the town or die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">My vows are equal partners with thy vows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,<br>
The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,<br>
We will bestow you in some better place,<br>
Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:<br>
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen<br>
And will be partner of your weal or woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Not to be gone from hence; for once I read<br>
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick<br>
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:<br>
Methinks I should revive the soldiers&#8217; hearts,<br>
Because I ever found them as myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!<br>
Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!<br>
And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,<br>
But gather we our forces out of hand<br>
And set upon our boasting enemy.</p>

What is the trust or strength of foolish man?<br>
They that of late were daring with their scoffs<br>
Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Bedford dies, and is carried
in by two in his chair</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">An alarum. Re-enter Talbot,
Burgundy, and the rest</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Lost, and recover&#8217;d in a day again!<br>
This is a double honour, Burgundy:<br>
Yet heavens have glory for this victory!</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy<br>
Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects<br>
Thy noble deeds as valour&#8217;s monuments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle
now?<br>
I think her old familiar is asleep:<br>
Now where&#8217;s the Bastard&#8217;s braves, and Charles his
gleeks?<br>
What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief<br>
That such a valiant company are fled.<br>
Now will we take some order in the town,<br>
Placing therein some expert officers,<br>
And then depart to Paris to the king,<br>
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">But yet, before we go, let&#8217;s not forget<br>
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,<br>
But see his exequies fulfill&#8217;d in Rouen:<br>
A braver soldier never couched lance,<br>
A gentler heart did never sway in court;<br>
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,<br>
For that&#8217;s the end of human misery.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The plains near Rouen.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Charles, the Bastard Of
Orleans, Alencon, Joan La Pucelle, and forces</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Dismay not, princes, at this accident,<br>
Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:<br>
Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,<br>
For things that are not to be remedied.<br>
Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while<br>
And like a peacock sweep along his tail;<br>
We&#8217;ll pull his plumes and take away his train,<br>
If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">We have been guided by thee hitherto,<br>
And of thy cunning had no diffidence:<br>
One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Search out thy wit for secret policies,<br>
And we will make thee famous through the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll set thy statue in some holy
place,<br>
And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:<br>
Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:<br>
By fair persuasions mix&#8217;d with sugar&#8217;d words<br>
We will entice the Duke of Burgundy<br>
To leave the Talbot and to follow us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,<br>
France were no place for Henry&#8217;s warriors;<br>
Nor should that nation boast it so with us,<br>
But be extirped from our provinces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">For ever should they be expulsed from France<br>
And not have title of an earldom here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Your honours shall perceive how I will work<br>
To bring this matter to the wished end.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum sounds afar
off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive<br>
Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here sound an English march.
Enter, and pass over at a distance, Talbot and his
forces</span></p>
<p class="speech">There goes the Talbot, with his colours
spread,<br>
And all the troops of English after him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">French march. Enter Burgundy
and forces</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:<br>
Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.<br>
Summon a parley; we will talk with him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sound a
parley</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">The princely Charles of France, thy
countryman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, Charles? for I am
marching hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy
words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!<br>
Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Speak on; but be not over-tedious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Look on thy country, look on fertile France,<br>
And see the cities and the towns defaced<br>
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.<br>
As looks the mother on her lowly babe<br>
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,<br>
See, see the pining malady of France;<br>
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,<br>
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.<br>
O, turn thy edged sword another way;<br>
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.<br>
One drop of blood drawn from thy country&#8217;s bosom<br>
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:<br>
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,<br>
And wash away thy country&#8217;s stained spots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Either she hath bewitch&#8217;d me with her
words,<br>
Or nature makes me suddenly relent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, all French and France exclaims on
thee,<br>
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.<br>
Who joint&#8217;st thou with but with a lordly nation<br>
That will not trust thee but for profit&#8217;s sake?<br>
When Talbot hath set footing once in France<br>
And fashion&#8217;d thee that instrument of ill,<br>
Who then but English Henry will be lord<br>
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?<br>
Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,<br>
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?<br>
And was he not in England prisoner?<br>
But when they heard he was thine enemy,<br>
They set him free without his ransom paid,<br>
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.<br>
See, then, thou fight&#8217;st against thy countrymen<br>
And joint&#8217;st with them will be thy slaughtermen.<br>
Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:<br>
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers<br>
Have batter&#8217;d me like roaring cannon-shot,<br>
And made me almost yield upon my knees.<br>
Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,<br>
And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:<br>
My forces and my power of men are yours:<br>
So farewell, Talbot; I&#8217;ll no longer trust thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Done like a
Frenchman: turn, and turn again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us
fresh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">And doth beget new courage in our breasts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Pucelle hath bravely play&#8217;d her part in
this,<br>
And doth deserve a coronet of gold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,<br>
And seek how we may prejudice the foe.</p>

Gloucester, Bishop Of Winchester, York, Suffolk, Somerset, Warwick,
Exeter, Vernon Basset, and others. To them with his Soldiers,
Talbot</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious prince, and honourable peers,<br>
Hearing of your arrival in this realm,<br>
I have awhile given truce unto my wars,<br>
To do my duty to my sovereign:<br>
In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim&#8217;d<br>
To your obedience fifty fortresses,<br>
Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,<br>
Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,<br>
Lets fall his sword before your highness&#8217; feet,<br>
And with submissive loyalty of heart<br>
Ascribes the glory of his conquest got<br>
First to my God and next unto your grace.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!<br>
When I was young, as yet I am not old,<br>
I do remember how my father said<br>
A stouter champion never handled sword.<br>
Long since we were resolved of your truth,<br>
Your faithful service and your toil in war;<br>
Yet never have you tasted our reward,<br>
Or been reguerdon&#8217;d with so much as thanks,<br>
Because till now we never saw your face:<br>
Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,<br>
We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;<br>
And in our coronation take your place.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all
but Vernon and Basset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,<br>
Disgracing of these colours that I wear<br>
In honour of my noble Lord of York:<br>
Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage<br>
The envious barking of your saucy tongue<br>
Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what is he? as good a man as York.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>

Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.<br>
But I&#8217;ll unto his majesty, and crave<br>
I may have liberty to venge this wrong;<br>
When thou shalt see I&#8217;ll meet thee to thy cost.</p>
