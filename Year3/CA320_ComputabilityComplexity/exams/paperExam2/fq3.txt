3.1)
The PDA is deterministic because there isn't more than one possible course of
action given the same start state, current input symbol, and current item on the 
top of the stack. The rules are all unique for each state.
For it to be non-deterministic, we need to have the same from-state and input symbol 
that leads to multiple to-states

3.2)
It is rejected. The following computation is of the format: input tape, reader 
header position, current state, current stack content.

aba, a, q0, []
aba, b, q1, [A]
aba, a, q1, [A,B]
aba, e, q2, [A]

It is rejected since although we end up in the final state, the stack is not empty. 
It seems to always add an extra B each time (for abba also).
