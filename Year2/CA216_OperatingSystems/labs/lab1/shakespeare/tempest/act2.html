<h4>Scene I. Another part of the island.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alonso, Sebastian,
Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,<br>
So have we all, of joy; for our escape<br>
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe<br>
Is common; every day some sailor&#8217;s wife,<br>
The masters of some merchant and the merchant<br>
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,<br>
I mean our preservation, few in millions<br>
Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh<br>
Our sorrow with our comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He receives comfort like cold porridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The visitor will not give him o&#8217;er so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Look he&#8217;s winding up the watch of his
wit;
by and by it will strike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">One: tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">When every grief is entertain&#8217;d
that&#8217;s offer&#8217;d,<br>
Comes to the entertainer&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A dollar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
should.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, spare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I have done: but yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He will be talking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">The old cock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The cockerel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Done. The wager?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">A laughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A match!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Though this island seem to be desert,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha! So, you&#8217;re paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He could not miss&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">It must needs be of subtle, tender and
delicate
temperance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Temperance was a delicate wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
delivered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">As if it had lungs and rotten ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Or as &#8217;twere perfumed by a fen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Here is everything advantageous to life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">True; save means to live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Of that there&#8217;s none, or little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">How lush and lusty the grass looks! how
green!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The ground indeed is tawny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">With an eye of green in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He misses not much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">But the rarity of it is,&#8212;which is indeed
almost
beyond credit,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">As many vouched rarities are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">That our garments, being, as they were, drenched
in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
not
say he lies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king&#8217;s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well
in our return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
to
their queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Not since widow Dido&#8217;s time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Widow! a pox o&#8217; that! How came that widow
in?
widow Dido!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What if he had said &#8216;widower Aeneas&#8217;
too? Good Lord,
how you take it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Widow Dido&#8217; said you? you make me
study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Carthage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I assure you, Carthage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">His word is more than the miraculous harp; he
hath
raised the wall and houses too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">What impossible matter will he make easy
next?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I think he will carry this island home in his
pocket
and give it his son for an apple.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea,
bring
forth more islands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, in good time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, we were talking that our garments seem
now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And the rarest that e&#8217;er came there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day
I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">That sort was well fished for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">When I wore it at your daughter&#8217;s
marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">You cram these words into mine ears against<br>
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never<br>
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,<br>
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,<br>
Who is so far from Italy removed<br>
I ne&#8217;er again shall see her. O thou mine heir<br>
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish<br>
Hath made his meal on thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he may live:<br>
I saw him beat the surges under him,<br>
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,<br>
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted<br>
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head<br>
&#8217;Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar&#8217;d<br>
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke<br>
To the shore, that o&#8217;er his wave-worn basis bow&#8217;d,<br>
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt<br>
He came alive to land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, he&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you may thank yourself for this great
loss,<br>
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,<br>
But rather lose her to an African;<br>
Where she at least is banish&#8217;d from your eye,<br>
Who hath cause to wet the grief on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">You were kneel&#8217;d to and importuned
otherwise<br>
By all of us, and the fair soul herself<br>
Weigh&#8217;d between loathness and obedience, at<br>
Which end o&#8217; the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,<br>
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have<br>
More widows in them of this business&#8217; making<br>
Than we bring men to comfort them:<br>
The fault&#8217;s your own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">So is the dear&#8217;st o&#8217; the loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord Sebastian,<br>
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness<br>
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,<br>
When you should bring the plaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And most chirurgeonly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">It is foul weather in us all, good sir,<br>
When you are cloudy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Foul weather?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Very foul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Had I plantation of this isle, my
lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ld sow&#8217;t with nettle-seed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Or docks, or mallows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">And were the king on&#8217;t, what would I
do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Scape being drunk for want of wine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; the commonwealth I would by
contraries<br>
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic<br>
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;<br>
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<br>
And use of service, none; contract, succession,<br>
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<br>
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;<br>
No occupation; all men idle, all;<br>
And women too, but innocent and pure;<br>
No sovereignty;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yet he would be king
on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The latter end of his commonwealth forgets
the
beginning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">All things in common nature should produce<br>
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,<br>
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,<br>
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,<br>
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,<br>
To feed my innocent people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">No marrying &#8217;mong his subjects?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I would with such perfection govern, sir,<br>
To excel the golden age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">God save his majesty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Long live Gonzalo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And,&#8212;do you mark me, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas you we laughed at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">What a blow was there given!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">An it had not fallen flat-long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would
lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ariel, invisible,
playing solemn music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Go sleep, and hear us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">All sleep except Alonso,
Sebastian, and Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes<br>
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find<br>
They are inclined to do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, sir,<br>
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:<br>
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,<br>
It is a comforter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We two, my lord,<br>
Will guard your person while you take your rest,<br>
And watch your safety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alonso sleeps. Exit
Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">It is the quality o&#8217; the climate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Why<br>
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not<br>
Myself disposed to sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I; my spirits are nimble.<br>
They fell together all, as by consent;<br>
They dropp&#8217;d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,<br>
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?&#8212;No more:&#8212;<br>
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,<br>
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and<br>
My strong imagination sees a crown<br>
Dropping upon thy head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou waking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not hear me speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I do; and surely<br>
It is a sleepy language and thou speak&#8217;st<br>
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?<br>
This is a strange repose, to be asleep<br>
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,<br>
And yet so fast asleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Sebastian,<br>
Thou let&#8217;st thy fortune sleep&#8212;die, rather;
wink&#8217;st<br>
Whiles thou art waking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost snore distinctly;<br>
There&#8217;s meaning in thy snores.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am more serious than my custom: you<br>
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do<br>
Trebles thee o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Well, I am standing water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll teach you how to flow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Do so: to ebb<br>
Hereditary sloth instructs me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O,<br>
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish<br>
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,<br>
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,<br>
Most often do so near the bottom run<br>
By their own fear or sloth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, say on:<br>
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim<br>
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed<br>
Which throes thee much to yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, sir:<br>
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,<br>
Who shall be of as little memory<br>
When he is earth&#8217;d, hath here almost persuade,&#8212;<br>
For he&#8217;s a spirit of persuasion, only<br>
Professes to persuade,&#8212;the king his son&#8217;s alive,<br>
&#8217;Tis as impossible that he&#8217;s undrown&#8217;d<br>
And he that sleeps here swims.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I have no hope<br>
That he&#8217;s undrown&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, out of that &#8216;no hope&#8217;<br>
What great hope have you! no hope that way is<br>
Another way so high a hope that even<br>
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,<br>
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me<br>
That Ferdinand is drown&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Then, tell me,<br>
Who&#8217;s the next heir of Naples?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Claribel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells<br>
Ten leagues beyond man&#8217;s life; she that from Naples<br>
Can have no note, unless the sun were post&#8212;<br>
The man i&#8217; the moon&#8217;s too slow&#8212;till new-born
chins<br>
Be rough and razorable; she that&#8212;from whom?<br>
We all were sea-swallow&#8217;d, though some cast again,<br>
And by that destiny to perform an act<br>
Whereof what&#8217;s past is prologue, what to come<br>
In yours and my discharge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What stuff is this! how say you?<br>
&#8217;Tis true, my brother&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s queen of
Tunis;<br>
So is she heir of Naples; &#8217;twixt which regions<br>
There is some space.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">A space whose every cubit<br>
Seems to cry out, &#8216;How shall that Claribel<br>
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,<br>
And let Sebastian wake.&#8217; Say, this were death<br>
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse<br>
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples<br>
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate<br>
As amply and unnecessarily<br>
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make<br>
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore<br>
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this<br>
For your advancement! Do you understand me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And how does your content<br>
Tender your own good fortune?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I remember<br>
You did supplant your brother Prospero.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">True:<br>
And look how well my garments sit upon me;<br>
Much feater than before: my brother&#8217;s servants<br>
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">But, for your conscience?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; where lies that? if &#8217;twere a
kibe,<br>
&#8217;Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not<br>
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,<br>
That stand &#8217;twixt me and Milan, candied be they<br>
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,<br>
No better than the earth he lies upon,<br>
If he were that which now he&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s dead;<br>
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,<br>
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,<br>
To the perpetual wink for aye might put<br>
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who<br>
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,<br>
They&#8217;ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;<br>
They&#8217;ll tell the clock to any business that<br>
We say befits the hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Thy case, dear friend,<br>
Shall be my precedent; as thou got&#8217;st Milan,<br>
I&#8217;ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke<br>
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;<br>
And I the king shall love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>

And when I rear my hand, do you the like,<br>
To fall it on Gonzalo.</p>

<p class="speech">O, but one word.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They talk apart</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel,
invisible</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">My master through his art foresees the danger<br>
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth&#8212;<br>
For else his project dies&#8212;to keep them living.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings in Gonzalo&#8217;s
ear</span></p>
<p class="speech">While you here do snoring lie,<br>
Open-eyed conspiracy<br>
His time doth take.<br>
If of life you keep a care,<br>
Shake off slumber, and beware:<br>
Awake, awake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Then let us both be sudden.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Now, good angels<br>
Preserve the king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They wake</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?<br>
Wherefore this ghastly looking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Whiles we stood here securing your repose,<br>
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing<br>
Like bulls, or rather lions: did&#8217;t not wake you?<br>
It struck mine ear most terribly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I heard nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;twas a din to fright a monster&#8217;s
ear,<br>
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar<br>
Of a whole herd of lions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Heard you this, Gonzalo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,<br>
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:<br>
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open&#8217;d,<br>
I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,<br>
That&#8217;s verily. &#8217;Tis best we stand upon our guard,<br>
Or that we quit this place; let&#8217;s draw our weapons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Lead off this ground; and let&#8217;s make
further search<br>
For my poor son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens keep him from these beasts!<br>
For he is, sure, i&#8217; the island.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Lead away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:<br>
So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Another part of the island.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Caliban with a burden
of wood. A noise of thunder heard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">All the infections that the sun sucks up<br>
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<br>
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me<br>
And yet I needs must curse. But they&#8217;ll nor pinch,<br>
Fright me with urchin&#8212;shows, pitch me i&#8217; the mire,<br>
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark<br>
Out of my way, unless he bid &#8217;em; but<br>
For every trifle are they set upon me;<br>
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me<br>
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which<br>
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount<br>
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I<br>
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues<br>
Do hiss me into madness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Trinculo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Lo, now, lo!<br>
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me<br>
For bringing wood in slowly. I&#8217;ll fall flat;<br>
Perchance he will not mind me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s neither bush nor shrub, to bear
off
any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
I hear it sing i&#8217; the wind: yond same black
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
should thunder as it did before, I know not
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o&#8217; my troth! I do now let loose
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Thunder</span></p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is
to
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Stephano, singing: a
bottle in his hand</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I shall no more to sea, to sea,<br>
Here shall I die ashore&#8212;<br>
This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man&#8217;s
funeral: well, here&#8217;s my comfort.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drinks</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,<br>
The gunner and his mate<br>
Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,<br>
But none of us cared for Kate;<br>
For she had a tongue with a tang,<br>
Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!<br>
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,<br>
Yet a tailor might scratch her where&#8217;er she did itch:<br>
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!<br>
This is a scurvy tune too: but here&#8217;s my comfort.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drinks</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Do not torment me: Oh!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter? Have we devils here? Do
you put
tricks upon&#8217;s with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
and it shall be said so again while Stephano
breathes at&#8217;s nostrils.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">The spirit torments me; Oh!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
who
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he&#8217;s a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat&#8217;s leather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Do not torment me, prithee; I&#8217;ll bring my
wood home faster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s in his fit now and does not talk after
the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
hath him, and that soundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
I
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
that
which will give language to you, cat: open your
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
and that soundly: you cannot tell who&#8217;s your friend:
open your chaps again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I should know that voice: it should be&#8212;but
he is
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Four legs and two voices: a most delicate
monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
will pour some in thy other mouth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Stephano!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This
is
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
long spoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me
and
speak to me: for I am Trinculo&#8212;be not afeard&#8212;thy
good friend Trinculo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I&#8217;ll
pull thee
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo&#8217;s legs,
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
he vent Trinculos?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.
But
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
under the dead moon-calf&#8217;s gaberdine for fear of
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
Stephano, two Neapolitans &#8217;scaped!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not
constant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> These be fine
things, an if they be
not sprites.
That&#8217;s a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
I will kneel to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">How didst thou &#8217;scape? How camest thou
hither?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
heaved o&#8217;erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
cast ashore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll swear upon that bottle to be thy true
subject;
for the liquor is not earthly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Here; swear then how thou escapedst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like
a
duck, I&#8217;ll be sworn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like
a
duck, thou art made like a goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">O Stephano. hast any more of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by
the
sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
how does thine ague?</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou not dropp&#8217;d from heaven?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Out o&#8217; the moon, I do assure thee: I was
the man i&#8217;
the moon when time was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:<br>
My mistress show&#8217;d me thee and thy dog and thy bush.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will
furnish
it anon with new contents swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">By this good light, this is a very shallow
monster!
I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i&#8217;
the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
drawn, monster, in good sooth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll show thee every fertile inch o&#8217;
th&#8217; island;<br>
And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
monster! when &#8217;s god&#8217;s asleep, he&#8217;ll rob his
bottle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll kiss thy foot; I&#8217;ll swear myself
thy subject.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Come on then; down, and swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I shall laugh myself to death at this
puppy-headed
monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
heart to beat him,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Come, kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">But that the poor monster&#8217;s in drink: an
abominable monster!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll show thee the best springs; I&#8217;ll
pluck thee berries;<br>
I&#8217;ll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.<br>
A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!<br>
I&#8217;ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,<br>
Thou wondrous man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of
a<br>
Poor drunkard!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs
grow;<br>
And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;<br>
Show thee a jay&#8217;s nest and instruct thee how<br>
To snare the nimble marmoset; I&#8217;ll bring thee<br>
To clustering filberts and sometimes I&#8217;ll get thee<br>
Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee now, lead the way without any more
talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we&#8217;ll fill him by
