<h4>Scene I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the
quay.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Montano and two
Gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">What from the cape can you discern at sea?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;<br>
I cannot, &#8217;twixt the heaven and the main,<br>
Descry a sail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;<br>
A fuller blast ne&#8217;er shook our battlements:<br>
If it hath ruffian&#8217;d so upon the sea,<br>
What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,<br>
Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">A segregation of the Turkish fleet:<br>
For do but stand upon the foaming shore,<br>
The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;<br>
The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,<br>
Seems to cast water on the burning bear,<br>
And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:<br>
I never did like molestation view<br>
On the enchafed flood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">If that the Turkish fleet<br>
Be not enshelter&#8217;d and embay&#8217;d, they are
drown&#8217;d:<br>
It is impossible they bear it out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a third
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">News, lads! our wars are done.<br>
The desperate tempest hath so bang&#8217;d the Turks,<br>
That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice<br>
Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance<br>
On most part of their fleet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">How! is this true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">The ship is here put in,<br>
A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,<br>
Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,<br>
Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,<br>
And is in full commission here for Cyprus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad on&#8217;t; &#8217;tis a worthy
governor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">But this same Cassio, though he speak of
comfort<br>
Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,<br>
And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted<br>
With foul and violent tempest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Pray heavens he be;<br>
For I have served him, and the man commands<br>
Like a full soldier. Let&#8217;s to the seaside, ho!<br>
As well to see the vessel that&#8217;s come in<br>
As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,<br>
Even till we make the main and the aerial blue<br>
An indistinct regard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let&#8217;s do so:<br>
For every minute is expectancy<br>
Of more arrivance.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,<br>
That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens<br>
Give him defence against the elements,<br>
For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Is he well shipp&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">His bark is stoutly timber&#8217;d, his pilot<br>
Of very expert and approved allowance;<br>
Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,<br>
Stand in bold cure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A cry within &#8216;A sail, a
sail, a sail!&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a fourth
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">What noise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">The town is empty; on the brow o&#8217; the
sea<br>
Stand ranks of people, and they cry &#8216;A sail!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">My hopes do shape him for the governor.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Guns heard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentlemen</p>
<p class="speech">They do discharge their shot of courtesy:<br>
Our friends at least.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, go forth,<br>
And give us truth who &#8217;tis that is arrived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I shall.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid<br>
That paragons description and wild fame;<br>
One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,<br>
And in the essential vesture of creation<br>
Does tire the ingener.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter second
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! who has put in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Has had most favourable and happy speed:<br>
Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,<br>
The gutter&#8217;d rocks and congregated sands&#8212;<br>
Traitors ensteep&#8217;d to clog the guiltless keel,&#8212;<br>
As having sense of beauty, do omit<br>
Their mortal natures, letting go safely by<br>
The divine Desdemona.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">What is she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She that I spake of, our great captain&#8217;s
captain,<br>
Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,<br>
Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts<br>
A se&#8217;nnight&#8217;s speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,<br>
And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,<br>
That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,<br>
Make love&#8217;s quick pants in Desdemona&#8217;s arms,<br>
Give renew&#8217;d fire to our extincted spirits<br>
And bring all Cyprus comfort!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Desdemona, Emilia,
Iago, Roderigo, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, behold,<br>
The riches of the ship is come on shore!<br>
Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.<br>
Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,<br>
Before, behind thee, and on every hand,<br>
Enwheel thee round!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, valiant Cassio.<br>
What tidings can you tell me of my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught<br>
But that he&#8217;s well and will be shortly here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O, but I fear&#8212;How lost you company?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">The great contention of the sea and skies<br>
Parted our fellowship&#8212;But, hark! a sail.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Within &#8216;A sail, a
sail!&#8217; Guns heard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">They give their greeting to the citadel;<br>
This likewise is a friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">See for the news.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Good ancient, you are welcome.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Emilia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, mistress.<br>
Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,<br>
That I extend my manners; &#8217;tis my breeding<br>
That gives me this bold show of courtesy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, would she give you so much of her lips<br>
As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,<br>
You&#8217;ll have enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, she has no speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, too much;<br>
I find it still, when I have list to sleep:<br>
Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,<br>
She puts her tongue a little in her heart,<br>
And chides with thinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">You have little cause to say so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, come on; you are pictures out of
doors,<br>
Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,<br>
Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,<br>
Players in your housewifery, and housewives&#8217; in your
beds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O, fie upon thee, slanderer!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:<br>
You rise to play and go to bed to work.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not write my praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">No, let me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou write of me, if thou
shouldst
praise me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O gentle lady, do not put me to&#8217;t;<br>
For I am nothing, if not critical.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Come on assay. There&#8217;s one gone to the
harbour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">I am not merry; but I do beguile<br>
The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.<br>
Come, how wouldst thou praise me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I am about it; but indeed my invention<br>
Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;<br>
It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,<br>
And thus she is deliver&#8217;d.<br>
If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,<br>
The one&#8217;s for use, the other useth it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Well praised! How if she be black and witty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">If she be black, and thereto have a wit,<br>
She&#8217;ll find a white that shall her blackness fit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Worse and worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Emilia</p>
<p class="speech">How if fair and foolish?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">She never yet was foolish that was fair;<br>
For even her folly help&#8217;d her to an heir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh
i&#8217;
the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
her that&#8217;s foul and foolish?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s none so foul and foolish
thereunto,<br>
But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst
best.
But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">She that was ever fair and never proud,<br>
Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,<br>
Never lack&#8217;d gold and yet went never gay,<br>
Fled from her wish and yet said &#8216;Now I may,&#8217;<br>
She that being anger&#8217;d, her revenge being nigh,<br>
Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,<br>
She that in wisdom never was so frail<br>
To change the cod&#8217;s head for the salmon&#8217;s tail;<br>
She that could think and ne&#8217;er disclose her mind,<br>
See suitors following and not look behind,<br>
She was a wight, if ever such wight were,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">To do what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not
learn
of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
counsellor?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more
in
the soldier than in the scholar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He takes her
by the palm: ay, well said,
whisper: with as little a web as this will I
ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
You say true; &#8217;tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
courtesy! &#8217;tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpet within</span></p>
<p class="speech">The Moor! I know his trumpet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis truly so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s meet him and receive him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, where he comes!</p>

Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">O my fair warrior!</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My dear Othello!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">It gives me wonder great as my content<br>
To see you here before me. O my soul&#8217;s joy!<br>
If after every tempest come such calms,<br>
May the winds blow till they have waken&#8217;d death!<br>
And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas<br>
Olympus-high and duck again as low<br>
As hell&#8217;s from heaven! If it were now to die,<br>
&#8217;Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,<br>
My soul hath her content so absolute<br>
That not another comfort like to this<br>
Succeeds in unknown fate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">The heavens forbid<br>
But that our loves and comforts should increase,<br>
Even as our days do grow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Amen to that, sweet powers!<br>
I cannot speak enough of this content;<br>
It stops me here; it is too much of joy:<br>
And this, and this, the greatest discords be</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing her</span></p>
<p class="speech">That e&#8217;er our hearts shall make!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O, you are
well tuned now!<br>
But I&#8217;ll set down the pegs that make this music,<br>
As honest as I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Come, let us to the castle.<br>
News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
are drown&#8217;d.<br>
How does my old acquaintance of this isle?<br>
Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;<br>
I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,<br>
I prattle out of fashion, and I dote<br>
In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,<br>
Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:<br>
Bring thou the master to the citadel;<br>
He is a good one, and his worthiness<br>
Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,<br>
Once more, well met at Cyprus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello, Desdemona,
and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Do thou meet me presently at the harbour.
Come
hither. If thou be&#8217;st valiant,&#8212; as, they say, base
men being in love have then a nobility in their
natures more than is native to them&#8212;list me. The
lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
guard:&#8212;first, I must tell thee this&#8212;Desdemona is
directly in love with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">With him! why, &#8217;tis not possible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be
instructed.
Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
and will she love him still for prating? let not
thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
and what delight shall she have to look on the
devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
instruct her in it and compel her to some second
choice. Now, sir, this granted,&#8212;as it is a most
pregnant and unforced position&#8212;who stands so
eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
does? a knave very voluble; no further
conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
requisites in him that folly and green minds look
after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
hath found him already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot believe that in her; she&#8217;s full
of
most blessed condition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Blessed fig&#8217;s-end! the wine she drinks is
made of
grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
not mark that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure
prologue
to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
the master and main exercise, the incorporate
conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
for the command, I&#8217;ll lay&#8217;t upon you. Cassio knows
you not. I&#8217;ll not be far from you: do you find
some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
other course you please, which the time shall more
favourably minister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and
haply
may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
impediment most profitably removed, without the
which there were no expectation of our prosperity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I will do this, if I can bring it to any
opportunity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the
citadel:<br>
I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;<br>
That she loves him, &#8217;tis apt and of great credit:<br>
The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,<br>
Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,<br>
And I dare think he&#8217;ll prove to Desdemona<br>
A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;<br>
Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure<br>
I stand accountant for as great a sin,<br>
But partly led to diet my revenge,<br>
For that I do suspect the lusty Moor<br>
Hath leap&#8217;d into my seat; the thought whereof<br>
Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;<br>
And nothing can or shall content my soul<br>
Till I am even&#8217;d with him, wife for wife,<br>
Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor<br>
At least into a jealousy so strong<br>
That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,<br>
If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash<br>
For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,<br>
I&#8217;ll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,<br>
Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb&#8212;<br>
For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too&#8212;<br>
Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.<br>
For making him egregiously an ass<br>
And practising upon his peace and quiet<br>
Even to madness. &#8217;Tis here, but yet confused:<br>
Knavery&#8217;s plain face is never seen tin used.</p>

Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest<br>
Let me have speech with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Desdemona</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, my dear love,<br>
The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;<br>
That profit&#8217;s yet to come &#8217;tween me and you.<br>
Good night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Othello, Desdemona,
and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Iago</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Not this hour, lieutenant; &#8217;tis not yet ten
o&#8217; the
clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
she is sport for Jove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a most exquisite lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And, I&#8217;ll warrant her, fun of game.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, she&#8217;s a most fresh and delicate
creature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley
of
provocation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">An inviting eye; and yet methinks right
modest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to
love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">She is indeed perfection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Well, happiness to their sheets! Come,
lieutenant, I
have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
the health of black Othello.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
courtesy would invent some other custom of
entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O, they are our friends; but one cup: I&#8217;ll
drink for
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that
was
craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
and dare not task my weakness with any more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What, man! &#8217;tis a night of revels: the
gallants
desire it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Where are they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t; but it dislikes me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">If I can fasten but one cup upon him,<br>
With that which he hath drunk to-night already,<br>
He&#8217;ll be as full of quarrel and offence<br>
As my young mistress&#8217; dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,<br>
Whom love hath turn&#8217;d almost the wrong side out,<br>
To Desdemona hath to-night caroused<br>
Potations pottle-deep; and he&#8217;s to watch:<br>
Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,<br>
That hold their honours in a wary distance,<br>
The very elements of this warlike isle,<br>
Have I to-night fluster&#8217;d with flowing cups,<br>
And they watch too. Now, &#8217;mongst this flock of drunkards,<br>
Am I to put our Cassio in some action<br>
That may offend the isle.&#8212;But here they come:<br>
If consequence do but approve my dream,<br>
My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Cassio; with him
Montano and Gentlemen; servants following with wine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, they have given me a rouse
already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I
am
a soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Some wine, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">And let me the canakin clink, clink;<br>
And let me the canakin clink<br>
A soldier&#8217;s a man;<br>
A life&#8217;s but a span;<br>
Why, then, let a soldier drink.<br>
Some wine, boys!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Fore God, an excellent song.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I learned it in England, where, indeed, they
are
most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
your swag-bellied Hollander&#8212;Drink, ho!&#8212;are nothing
to your English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane
dead
drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
can be filled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">To the health of our general!</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">I am for it, lieutenant; and I&#8217;ll do you
justice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">O sweet England!<br>
King Stephen was a worthy peer,<br>
His breeches cost him but a crown;<br>
He held them sixpence all too dear,<br>
With that he call&#8217;d the tailor lown.<br>
He was a wight of high renown,<br>
And thou art but of low degree:<br>
&#8217;Tis pride that pulls the country down;<br>
Then take thine auld cloak about thee.<br>
Some wine, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is a more exquisite song than the
other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Will you hear&#8217;t again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place
that
does those things. Well, God&#8217;s above all; and there
be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">It&#8217;s true, good lieutenant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">For mine own part,&#8212;no offence to the
general, nor
any man of quality,&#8212;I hope to be saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And so do I too, lieutenant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let&#8217;s
have no more of this; let&#8217;s to our affairs.&#8212;Forgive
us our sins!&#8212;Gentlemen, let&#8217;s look to our business.
Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
speak well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well then; you must not think then that
I am drunk.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">To the platform, masters; come, let&#8217;s set
the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You see this fellow that is gone before;<br>
He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar<br>
And give direction: and do but see his vice;<br>
&#8217;Tis to his virtue a just equinox,<br>
The one as long as the other: &#8217;tis pity of him.<br>
I fear the trust Othello puts him in.<br>
On some odd time of his infirmity,<br>
Will shake this island.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">But is he often thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis evermore the prologue to his
sleep:<br>
He&#8217;ll watch the horologe a double set,<br>
If drink rock not his cradle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">It were well<br>
The general were put in mind of it.<br>
Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature<br>
Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,<br>
And looks not on his evils: is not this true?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Roderigo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to him]</span> How
now, Roderigo!<br>
I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Roderigo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">And &#8217;tis great pity that the noble Moor<br>
Should hazard such a place as his own second<br>
With one of an ingraft infirmity:<br>
It were an honest action to say<br>
So to the Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not I, for this fair island:<br>
I do love Cassio well; and would do much<br>
To cure him of this evil&#8212;But, hark! what noise?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cry within: &#8216;Help!
help!&#8217;</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">You rogue! you rascal!</p>

<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">A knave teach me my duty!<br>
I&#8217;ll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>

<p class="speaker">Montano</p>

<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">What is the matter here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the
death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Faints</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>

<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, ho!
Lieutenant,&#8212;sir&#8212;Montano,&#8212;gentlemen,&#8212;<br>
Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?<br>
Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?<br>
Are we turn&#8217;d Turks, and to ourselves do that<br>
Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?<br>
For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:<br>
He that stirs next to carve for his own rage<br>
Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.<br>
Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle<br>
From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?<br>
Honest Iago, that look&#8217;st dead with grieving,<br>
Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know: friends all but now, even now,<br>
In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom<br>
Devesting them for bed; and then, but now&#8212;<br>
As if some planet had unwitted men&#8212;<br>
Swords out, and tilting one at other&#8217;s breast,<br>
In opposition bloody. I cannot speak<br>
Any beginning to this peevish odds;<br>
And would in action glorious I had lost<br>
Those legs that brought me to a part of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;<br>
The gravity and stillness of your youth<br>
The world hath noted, and your name is great<br>
In mouths of wisest censure: what&#8217;s the matter,<br>
That you unlace your reputation thus<br>
And spend your rich opinion for the name<br>
Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:<br>
Your officer, Iago, can inform you,&#8212;<br>
While I spare speech, which something now
offends me,&#8212;<br>
Of all that I do know: nor know I aught<br>
By me that&#8217;s said or done amiss this night;<br>
Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,<br>
And to defend ourselves it be a sin<br>
When violence assails us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by heaven,<br>
My blood begins my safer guides to rule;<br>
And passion, having my best judgment collied,<br>
Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,<br>
Or do but lift this arm, the best of you<br>
Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know<br>
How this foul rout began, who set it on;<br>
And he that is approved in this offence,<br>
Though he had twinn&#8217;d with me, both at a birth,<br>
Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,<br>
Yet wild, the people&#8217;s hearts brimful of fear,<br>
To manage private and domestic quarrel,<br>
In night, and on the court and guard of safety!<br>
&#8217;Tis monstrous. Iago, who began&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montano</p>
<p class="speech">If partially affined, or leagued in office,<br>
Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,<br>
Thou art no soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Touch me not so near:<br>
I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth<br>
Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;<br>
Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth<br>
Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.<br>
Montano and myself being in speech,<br>
There comes a fellow crying out for help:<br>
And Cassio following him with determined sword,<br>
To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman<br>
Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:<br>
Myself the crying fellow did pursue,<br>
Lest by his clamour&#8212;as it so fell out&#8212;<br>
The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,<br>
Outran my purpose; and I return&#8217;d the rather<br>
For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,<br>
And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night<br>
I ne&#8217;er might say before. When I came back&#8212;<br>
For this was brief&#8212;I found them close together,<br>
At blow and thrust; even as again they were<br>
When you yourself did part them.<br>
More of this matter cannot I report:<br>
But men are men; the best sometimes forget:<br>
Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,<br>
As men in rage strike those that wish them best,<br>
Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received<br>
From him that fled some strange indignity,<br>
Which patience could not pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">I know, Iago,<br>
Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,<br>
Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee<br>
But never more be officer of mine.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Desdemona,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!<br>
I&#8217;ll make thee an example.</p>
<p class="speaker">Desdemona</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Othello</p>
<p class="speech">All&#8217;s well now, sweeting; come away to
bed.<br>
Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:<br>
Lead him off.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Montano, who is led
off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Iago, look with care about the town,<br>
And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.<br>
Come, Desdemona: &#8217;tis the soldiers&#8217; life<br>
To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Iago and
Cassio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What, are you hurt, lieutenant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, past all surgery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, heaven forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have
lost
my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
Iago, my reputation!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">As I am an honest man, I thought you had
received
some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
there are ways to recover the general again: you
are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
to him again, and he&#8217;s yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive
so
good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
fustian with one&#8217;s own shadow? O thou invisible
spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
let us call thee devil!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">What was he that you followed with your sword?<br>
What
had he done to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I remember a mass of things, but nothing
distinctly;
a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Why, but you are now well enough: how came you
thus
recovered?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give
place
to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
another, to make me frankly despise myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the
time,
the place, and the condition of this country
stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell
me
I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, good wine is a good familiar
creature,
if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You or any man living may be drunk! at a time,
man.
I&#8217;ll tell you what you shall do. Our general&#8217;s wife
is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
her help to put you in your place again: she is of
so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
than she is requested: this broken joint between
you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">You advise me well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest
kindness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassio</p>
<p class="speech">I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I
will
beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant;
I
must to the watch.
Cassio: Good night, honest Iago.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">And what&#8217;s he then that says I play the
villain?<br>
When this advice is free I give and honest,<br>
Probal to thinking and indeed the course<br>
To win the Moor again? For &#8217;tis most easy<br>
The inclining Desdemona to subdue<br>
In any honest suit: she&#8217;s framed as fruitful<br>
As the free elements. And then for her<br>
To win the Moor&#8212;were&#8217;t to renounce his baptism,<br>
All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,<br>
His soul is so enfetter&#8217;d to her love,<br>
That she may make, unmake, do what she list,<br>
Even as her appetite shall play the god<br>
With his weak function. How am I then a villain<br>
To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,<br>
Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!<br>
When devils will the blackest sins put on,<br>
They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,<br>
As I do now: for whiles this honest fool<br>
Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes<br>
And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,<br>
I&#8217;ll pour this pestilence into his ear,<br>
That she repeals him for her body&#8217;s lust;<br>
And by how much she strives to do him good,<br>
She shall undo her credit with the Moor.<br>
So will I turn her virtue into pitch,<br>
And out of her own goodness make the net<br>
That shall enmesh them all.</p>

<p class="speech">How now, Roderigo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roderigo</p>
<p class="speech">I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound
that
hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iago</p>
<p class="speech">How poor are they that have not patience!<br>
What wound did ever heal but by degrees?<br>
Thou know&#8217;st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;<br>
And wit depends on dilatory time.<br>
Does&#8217;t not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.<br>
And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier&#8217;d Cassio:<br>
Though other things grow fair against the sun,<br>
Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:<br>
Content thyself awhile. By the mass, &#8217;tis morning;<br>
Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.<br>
Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:<br>
Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:<br>
Nay, get thee gone.</p>

<p class="speech">Two things are to be done:<br>
My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;<br>
I&#8217;ll set her on;<br>
Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,<br>
And bring him jump when he may Cassio find<br>
Soliciting his wife: ay, that&#8217;s the way<br>
Dull not device by coldness and delay.</p>
