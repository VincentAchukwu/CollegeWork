<h4>Scene I. London. The Parliament-house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Enter York, Edward,
Richard, Norfolk, Montague, Warwick, and Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">While we pursued the horsemen of the north,<br>
He slily stole away and left his men:<br>
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,<br>
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,<br>
Cheer&#8217;d up the drooping army; and himself,<br>
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,<br>
Charged our main battle&#8217;s front, and breaking in<br>
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Stafford&#8217;s father, Duke of
Buckingham,<br>
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;<br>
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:<br>
That this is true, father, behold his blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">And, brother, here&#8217;s the Earl of
Wiltshire&#8217;s blood,<br>
Whom I encounter&#8217;d as the battles join&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throwing down
Somerset&#8217;s head</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.<br>
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Thus do I hope to shake King Henry&#8217;s
head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,<br>
Before I see thee seated in that throne<br>
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,<br>
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.<br>
This is the palace of the fearful king,<br>
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;<br>
For this is thine and not King Henry&#8217;s heirs&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;<br>
For hither we have broken in by force.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll all assist you; he that flies shall
die.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;<br>
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They go up</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And when the king comes, offer no violence,<br>
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">The queen this day here holds her parliament,<br>
But little thinks we shall be of her council:<br>
By words or blows here let us win our right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d as we are, let&#8217;s stay within
this house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">The bloody parliament shall this be
call&#8217;d,<br>
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,<br>
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice<br>
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;<br>
I mean to take possession of my right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,<br>
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,<br>
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.<br>
I&#8217;ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:<br>
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter King Henry
VI, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Exeter, and the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,<br>
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,<br>
Back&#8217;d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,<br>
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.<br>
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.<br>
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow&#8217;d revenge<br>
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in
steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall we suffer this? let&#8217;s pluck him
down:<br>
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Patience is for poltroons, such as he:<br>
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.<br>
My gracious lord, here in the parliament<br>
Let us assail the family of York.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, know you not the city favours them,<br>
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">But when the duke is slain, they&#8217;ll quickly
fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Far be the thought of this from Henry&#8217;s
heart,<br>
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!<br>
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats<br>
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.<br>
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,<br>
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;<br>
I am thy sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I am thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of
York.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas my inheritance, as the earldom
was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown<br>
In following this usurping Henry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Whom should he follow but his natural king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">True, Clifford; and that&#8217;s Richard Duke of
York.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">It must and shall be so: content thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;<br>
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget<br>
That we are those which chased you from the field<br>
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread<br>
March&#8217;d through the city to the palace gates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;<br>
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,<br>
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I&#8217;ll have more lives<br>
Than drops of blood were in my father&#8217;s veins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,<br>
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger<br>
As shall revenge his death before I stir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless
threats!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Will you we show our title to the crown?<br>
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?<br>
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;<br>
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:<br>
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,<br>
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop<br>
And seized upon their towns and provinces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">The lord protector lost it, and not I:<br>
When I was crown&#8217;d I was but nine months old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you
lose.<br>
Father, tear the crown from the usurper&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest
arms,<br>
Let&#8217;s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will
fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Sons, peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to
speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him,
lords;<br>
And be you silent and attentive too,<br>
For he that interrupts him shall not live.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Think&#8217;st thou that I will leave my kingly
throne,<br>
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?<br>
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;<br>
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,<br>
And now in England to our heart&#8217;s great sorrow,<br>
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?<br>
My title&#8217;s good, and better far than his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas by rebellion against his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I know not
what to say; my title&#8217;s weak.&#8212;<br>
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">An if he may, then am I lawful king;<br>
For Richard, in the view of many lords,<br>
Resign&#8217;d the crown to Henry the Fourth,<br>
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">He rose against him, being his sovereign,<br>
And made him to resign his crown perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Suppose, my lords, he did it
unconstrain&#8217;d,<br>
Think you &#8217;twere prejudicial to his crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">No; for he could not so resign his crown<br>
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> All will
revolt from me, and turn to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet, for all the claim thou
lay&#8217;st,<br>
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art deceived: &#8217;tis not thy southern
power,<br>
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,<br>
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,<br>
Can set the duke up in despite of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,<br>
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:<br>
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,<br>
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.<br>
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Do right unto this princely Duke of York,<br>
Or I will fill the house with armed men,<br>
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,<br>
Write up his title with usurping blood.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He stamps with his foot and
the soldiers show themselves</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:<br>
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,<br>
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I am content: Richard Plantagenet,<br>
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">What good is this to England and himself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Base, fearful and despairing Henry!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot stay to hear these articles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these
news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,<br>
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Be thou a prey unto the house of York,<br>
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,<br>
Or live in peace abandon&#8217;d and despised!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Northumberland,
Clifford, and Westmoreland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">They seek revenge and therefore will not
yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Exeter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why should you sigh, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,<br>
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.<br>
But be it as it may: I here entail<br>
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;<br>
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath<br>
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,<br>
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,<br>
And neither by treason nor hostility<br>
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">This oath I willingly take and will perform.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And long live thou and these thy forward
sons!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Here they come
down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my gracious lord; I&#8217;ll to my
castle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll keep London with my soldiers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">And I to Norfolk with my followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">And I unto the sea from whence I came.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt York, Edward, Edmund,
George, Richard, Warwick, Norfolk, Montague, their Soldiers, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret and
Prince Edward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her
anger:<br>
I&#8217;ll steal away.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Exeter, so will I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Who can be patient in such extremes?<br>
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid<br>
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,<br>
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father<br>
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?<br>
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,<br>
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,<br>
Or nourish&#8217;d him as I did with my blood,<br>
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,<br>
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir<br>
And disinherited thine only son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Father, you cannot disinherit me:<br>
If you be king, why should not I succeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:<br>
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be
forced?<br>
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!<br>
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;<br>
And given unto the house of York such head<br>
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.<br>
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,<br>
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre<br>
And creep into it far before thy time?<br>
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;<br>
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;<br>
The duke is made protector of the realm;<br>
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds<br>
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.<br>
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,<br>
The soldiers should have toss&#8217;d me on their pikes<br>
Before I would have granted to that act.<br>
But thou preferr&#8217;st thy life before thine honour:<br>
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself<br>
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,<br>
Until that act of parliament be repeal&#8217;d<br>
Whereby my son is disinherited.<br>
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours<br>
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;<br>
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace<br>
And utter ruin of the house of York.<br>
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let&#8217;s away;<br>
Our army is ready; come, we&#8217;ll after them.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee
gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to be murder&#8217;d by his enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">When I return with victory from the field<br>
I&#8217;ll see your grace: till then I&#8217;ll follow her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Queen Margaret and
Prince Edward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Poor queen! how love to me and to her son<br>
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!<br>
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,<br>
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,<br>
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle<br>
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!<br>
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:<br>
I&#8217;ll write unto them and entreat them fair.<br>
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.</p>

<p class="speech">Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?<br>
What is your quarrel? how began it first?</p>

<p class="speech">No quarrel, but a slight contention.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">About what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">About that which concerns your grace and us;<br>
The crown of England, father, which is yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>

<p class="speech">An oath is of no moment, being not took<br>
Before a true and lawful magistrate,<br>
That hath authority over him that swears:<br>
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;<br>
Then, seeing &#8217;twas he that made you to depose,<br>
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.<br>
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think<br>
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;<br>
Within whose circuit is Elysium<br>
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.<br>
Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest<br>
Until the white rose that I wear be dyed<br>
Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>

Brother, thou shalt to London presently,<br>

Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,<br>

You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,<br>
With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:<br>
In them I trust; for they are soldiers,<br>
Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.<br>
While you are thus employ&#8217;d, what resteth more,<br>
But that I seek occasion how to rise,<br>
And yet the king not privy to my drift,<br>
Nor any of the house of Lancaster?</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, with my sword. What! think&#8217;st thou that

Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;<br>
My brother Montague shall post to London:<br>
Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,<br>
Whom we have left protectors of the king,<br>
With powerful policy strengthen themselves,<br>
And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>

<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,<br>
I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.<br>
Many a battle have I won in France,<br>

Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,<br>

Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.<br>
I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:<br>
Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.</p>

He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.</p>

Were not revenge sufficient for me;<br>
No, if I digg&#8217;d up thy forefathers&#8217; graves<br>
And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,<br>
It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.<br>
The sight of any of the house of York<br>
Is as a fury to torment my soul;<br>
And till I root out their accursed line<br>

<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">The army of the queen hath got the field:<br>
My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;<br>
And all my followers to the eager foe<br>
Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind<br>
Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.<br>
My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:<br>
But this I know, they have demean&#8217;d themselves<br>
Like men born to renown by life or death.<br>
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.<br>
And thrice cried &#8216;Courage, father! fight it out!&#8217;<br>
And full as oft came Edward to my side,<br>
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt<br>
In blood of those that had encounter&#8217;d him:<br>
And when the hardiest warriors did retire,<br>
Richard cried &#8216;Charge! and give no foot of ground!&#8217;<br>
And cried &#8216;A crown, or else a glorious tomb!<br>
A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!&#8217;<br>
With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!<br>
We bodged again; as I have seen a swan<br>
With bootless labour swim against the tide<br>
And spend her strength with over-matching waves.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A short alarum

<p class="speech">Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;<br>
And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:<br>
And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:<br>
The sands are number&#8217;d that make up my life;<br>
Here must I stay, and here my life must end.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret,
Clifford, Northumberland, Prince Edward, and Soldiers</span></p>

I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:<br>
I am your butt, and I abide your shot.</p>

<p class="speech">Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,<br>
With downright payment, show&#8217;d unto my father.<br>
Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,<br>
And made an evening at the noontide prick.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth<br>
A bird that will revenge upon you all:<br>
And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,<br>
Scorning whate&#8217;er you can afflict me with.<br>
Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">So cowards fight when they can fly no

So doves do peck the falcon&#8217;s piercing talons;<br>
So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,<br>
Breathe out invectives &#8217;gainst the officers.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,<br>
And in thy thought o&#8217;er-run my former time;<br>
And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,<br>
And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice<br>
Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">I will not bandy with thee word for word,<br>
But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes<br>
I would prolong awhile the traitor&#8217;s life.<br>
Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much<br>
To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:<br>
What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,<br>
For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,<br>
When he might spurn him with his foot away?<br>
It is war&#8217;s prize to take all vantages;<br>
And ten to one is no impeach of valour.</p>

<p class="speech">What would your grace have done unto him now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,<br>
Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,<br>
That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,<br>
Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.<br>
What! was it you that would be England&#8217;s king?<br>
Was&#8217;t you that revell&#8217;d in our parliament,<br>
And made a preachment of your high descent?<br>
Where are your mess of sons to back you now?<br>
The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?<br>
And where&#8217;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,<br>
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice<br>
Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?<br>
Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?<br>
Look, York: I stain&#8217;d this napkin with the blood<br>
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier&#8217;s point,<br>
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;<br>
And if thine eyes can water for his death,<br>
I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.<br>
Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,<br>
I should lament thy miserable state.<br>
I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.<br>
What, hath thy fiery heart so parch&#8217;d thine entrails<br>
That not a tear can fall for Rutland&#8217;s death?<br>
Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;<br>
And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.<br>
Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.<br>
Thou wouldst be fee&#8217;d, I see, to make me sport:<br>
York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.<br>
A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:<br>
Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Putting a paper crown on his
head</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!<br>
Ay, this is he that took King Henry&#8217;s chair,<br>
And this is he was his adopted heir.<br>
But how is it that great Plantagenet<br>
Is crown&#8217;d so soon, and broke his solemn oath?<br>
As I bethink me, you should not be king<br>
Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.<br>
And will you pale your head in Henry&#8217;s glory,<br>
And rob his temples of the diadem,<br>
Now in his life, against your holy oath?<br>
O, &#8217;tis a fault too too unpardonable!<br>
Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;<br>
And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">That is my office, for my father&#8217;s
sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of
France,<br>
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder&#8217;s tooth!<br>
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex<br>
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,<br>
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!<br>
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,<br>
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,<br>
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.<br>
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,<br>
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.<br>
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,<br>
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,<br>
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.<br>
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?<br>
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,<br>
Unless the adage must be verified,<br>
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.<br>
&#8217;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;<br>
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:<br>
&#8217;Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;<br>
The contrary doth make thee wonder&#8217;d at:<br>
&#8217;Tis government that makes them seem divine;<br>
The want thereof makes thee abominable:<br>
Thou art as opposite to every good<br>
As the Antipodes are unto us,<br>
Or as the south to the septentrion.<br>
O tiger&#8217;s heart wrapt in a woman&#8217;s hide!<br>
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,<br>
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,<br>
And yet be seen to bear a woman&#8217;s face?<br>
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;<br>
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.<br>
Bids&#8217;t thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:<br>
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:<br>
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,<br>
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.<br>
These tears are my sweet Rutland&#8217;s obsequies:<br>
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,<br>
&#8217;Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false<br>
Frenchwoman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so<br>
That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">That face of his the hungry cannibals<br>
Would not have touch&#8217;d, would not have stain&#8217;d with
blood:<br>
But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,<br>
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.<br>
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father&#8217;s tears:<br>
This cloth thou dip&#8217;dst in blood of my sweet boy,<br>
And I with tears do wash the blood away.<br>
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:<br>
And if thou tell&#8217;st the heavy story right,<br>
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;<br>
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,<br>
And say &#8216;Alas, it was a piteous deed!&#8217;<br>
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;<br>
And in thy need such comfort come to thee<br>
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!<br>
Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:<br>
My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,<br>
I should not for my life but weep with him.<br>
To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?<br>
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,<br>
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s for my oath, here&#8217;s for my
father&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabbing him</span></p>
