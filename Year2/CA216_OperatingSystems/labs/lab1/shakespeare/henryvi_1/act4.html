<h4>Scene I. Paris. A hall of state.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry VI,
Gloucester, Bishop Of Winchester, York, Suffolk, Somerset, Warwick,
Talbot, Exeter, the Governor, of Paris, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,<br>
That you elect no other king but him;<br>
Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,<br>
And none your foes but such as shall pretend<br>
Malicious practises against his state:<br>
This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Fastolfe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Fastolfe</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,<br>
To haste unto your coronation,<br>
A letter was deliver&#8217;d to my hands,<br>
Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!<br>
I vow&#8217;d, base knight, when I did meet thee next,<br>
To tear the garter from thy craven&#8217;s leg,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Plucking it off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Which I have done, because unworthily<br>
Thou wast installed in that high degree.<br>
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest<br>
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,<br>
When but in all I was six thousand strong<br>
And that the French were almost ten to one,<br>
Before we met or that a stroke was given,<br>
Like to a trusty squire did run away:<br>
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;<br>
Myself and divers gentlemen beside<br>
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.<br>
Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;<br>
Or whether that such cowards ought to wear<br>
This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To say the truth, this fact was infamous<br>
And ill beseeming any common man,<br>
Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">When first this order was ordain&#8217;d, my
lords,<br>
Knights of the garter were of noble birth,<br>
Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,<br>
Such as were grown to credit by the wars;<br>
Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,<br>
But always resolute in most extremes.<br>
He then that is not furnish&#8217;d in this sort<br>
Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,<br>
Profaning this most honourable order,<br>
And should, if I were worthy to be judge,<br>
Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain<br>
That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear&#8217;st thy
doom!<br>
Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:<br>
Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Fastolfe</span></p>
<p class="speech">And now, my lord protector, view the letter<br>
Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What means his grace, that he hath changed his
style?<br>
No more but, plain and bluntly, &#8216;To the king!&#8217;<br>
Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?<br>
Or doth this churlish superscription<br>
Pretend some alteration in good will?<br>
What&#8217;s here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;I have, upon especial cause,<br>
Moved with compassion of my country&#8217;s wreck,<br>
Together with the pitiful complaints<br>
Of such as your oppression feeds upon,<br>
Forsaken your pernicious faction<br>
And join&#8217;d with Charles, the rightful King of
France.&#8217;<br>
O monstrous treachery! can this be so,<br>
That in alliance, amity and oaths,<br>
There should be found such false dissembling guile?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Is that the worst this letter doth contain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with
him<br>
And give him chastisement for this abuse.<br>
How say you, my lord? are you not content?</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Content, my liege! yes, but that I am
prevented,<br>
I should have begg&#8217;d I might have been employ&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Then gather strength and march unto him
straight:<br>
Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason<br>
And what offence it is to flout his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">I go, my lord, in heart desiring still<br>
You may behold confusion of your foes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Vernon and
Basset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, lords; and give them leave to
speak.<br>
Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?<br>
And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What is that wrong whereof you both complain?<br>
First let me know, and then I&#8217;ll answer you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">Crossing the sea from England into France,<br>
This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,<br>
Upbraided me about the rose I wear;<br>
Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves<br>
Did represent my master&#8217;s blushing cheeks,<br>
When stubbornly he did repugn the truth<br>
About a certain question in the law<br>
Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;<br>
With other vile and ignominious terms:<br>
In confutation of which rude reproach<br>
And in defence of my lord&#8217;s worthiness,<br>
I crave the benefit of law of arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">And that is my petition, noble lord:<br>
For though he seem with forged quaint conceit<br>
To set a gloss upon his bold intent,<br>
Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;<br>
And he first took exceptions at this badge,<br>
Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower<br>
Bewray&#8217;d the faintness of my master&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will
out,<br>
Though ne&#8217;er so cunningly you smother it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick
men,<br>
When for so slight and frivolous a cause<br>
Such factious emulations shall arise!<br>
Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,<br>
Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Let this dissension first be tried by fight,<br>
And then your highness shall command a peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;<br>
Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vernon</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let it rest where it began at first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Basset</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!<br>
And perish ye, with your audacious prate!<br>
Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed<br>
With this immodest clamorous outrage<br>
To trouble and disturb the king and us?<br>
And you, my lords, methinks you do not well<br>
To bear with their perverse objections;<br>
Much less to take occasion from their mouths<br>
To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:<br>
Let me persuade you take a better course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">It grieves his highness: good my lords, be
friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, you that would be combatants:<br>
Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,<br>
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.<br>
And you, my lords, remember where we are,<br>
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:<br>
If they perceive dissension in our looks<br>
And that within ourselves we disagree,<br>
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked<br>
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!<br>
Beside, what infamy will there arise,<br>
When foreign princes shall be certified<br>
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,<br>
King Henry&#8217;s peers and chief nobility<br>
Destroy&#8217;d themselves, and lost the realm of France!<br>
O, think upon the conquest of my father,<br>
My tender years, and let us not forego<br>
That for a trifle that was bought with blood<br>
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.<br>
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Putting on a red
rose</span></p>
<p class="speech">That any one should therefore be suspicious<br>
I more incline to Somerset than York:<br>
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:<br>
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,<br>
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown&#8217;d.<br>
But your discretions better can persuade<br>
Than I am able to instruct or teach:<br>
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,<br>
So let us still continue peace and love.<br>
Cousin of York, we institute your grace<br>
To be our regent in these parts of France:<br>
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite<br>
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;<br>
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,<br>
Go cheerfully together and digest.<br>
Your angry choler on your enemies.<br>
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest<br>
After some respite will return to Calais;<br>
From thence to England; where I hope ere long<br>
To be presented, by your victories,<br>
With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt all but
York, Warwick, Exeter and Vernon</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of York, I promise you, the king<br>
Prettily, methought, did play the orator.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">And so he did; but yet I like it not,<br>
In that he wears the badge of Somerset.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;<br>
I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">An if I wist he did,&#8212;but let it rest;<br>
Other affairs must now be managed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Exeter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy
voice;<br>
For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,<br>
I fear we should have seen decipher&#8217;d there<br>
More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,<br>
Than yet can be imagined or supposed.<br>
But howsoe&#8217;er, no simple man that sees<br>
This jarring discord of nobility,<br>
This shouldering of each other in the court,<br>
This factious bandying of their favourites,<br>
But that it doth presage some ill event.<br>
&#8217;Tis much when sceptres are in children&#8217;s hands;<br>
But more when envy breeds unkind division;<br>
There comes the rain, there begins confusion.</p>

drum</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:<br>
Summon their general unto the wall.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpet sounds. Enter General
and others, aloft</span></p>
<p class="speech">English John Talbot, captains, calls you
forth,<br>
Servant in arms to Harry King of England;<br>
And thus he would: Open your city gates;<br>
Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,<br>
And do him homage as obedient subjects;<br>
And I&#8217;ll withdraw me and my bloody power:<br>
But, if you frown upon this proffer&#8217;d peace,<br>
You tempt the fury of my three attendants,<br>
Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;<br>
Who in a moment even with the earth<br>
Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,<br>
If you forsake the offer of their love.</p>
<p class="speaker">General</p>
<p class="speech">Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,<br>
Our nation&#8217;s terror and their bloody scourge!<br>
The period of thy tyranny approacheth.<br>
On us thou canst not enter but by death;<br>
For, I protest, we are well fortified<br>
And strong enough to issue out and fight:<br>
If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,<br>
Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:<br>
On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch&#8217;d,<br>
To wall thee from the liberty of flight;<br>
And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,<br>
But death doth front thee with apparent spoil<br>
And pale destruction meets thee in the face.<br>
Ten thousand French have ta&#8217;en the sacrament<br>
To rive their dangerous artillery<br>
Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.<br>
Lo, there thou stand&#8217;st, a breathing valiant man,<br>
Of an invincible unconquer&#8217;d spirit!<br>
This is the latest glory of thy praise<br>
That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;<br>
For ere the glass, that now begins to run,<br>
Finish the process of his sandy hour,<br>
These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,<br>
Shall see thee wither&#8217;d, bloody, pale and dead.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum afar off</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark! hark! the Dauphin&#8217;s drum, a warning
bell,<br>
Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;<br>
And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt General, &amp;
c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">He fables not; I hear the enemy:<br>
Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.<br>
O, negligent and heedless discipline!<br>
How are we park&#8217;d and bounded in a pale,<br>
A little herd of England&#8217;s timorous deer,<br>
Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!<br>
If we be English deer, be then in blood;<br>
Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,<br>
But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,<br>
Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel<br>
And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:<br>
Sell every man his life as dear as mine,<br>
And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.<br>
God and Saint George, Talbot and England&#8217;s right,<br>
Prosper our colours in this dangerous fight!</p>

To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!<br>
Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England&#8217;s honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart<br>
Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot&#8217;s place!<br>
So should we save a valiant gentleman<br>
By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.<br>
Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,<br>
That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.</p>

We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;<br>
All &#8217;long of this vile traitor Somerset.</p>

I met in travel toward his warlike father!<br>
This seven years did not Talbot see his son;<br>
And now they meet where both their lives are done.</p>

Away! vexation almost stops my breath,<br>

Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,<br>

You, his false hopes, the trust of England&#8217;s honour,<br>
Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.<br>
Let not your private discord keep away<br>
The levied succors that should lend him aid,<br>
While he, renowned noble gentleman,<br>
Yields up his life unto a world of odds:<br>
Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,<br>
Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,<br>

I owe him little duty, and less love;<br>

<p class="speech">Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?<br>
And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,<br>
Dishonour not her honourable name,<br>
To make a bastard and a slave of me!<br>
The world will say, he is not Talbot&#8217;s blood,<br>
That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">He that flies so will ne&#8217;er return
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">If we both stay, we both are sure to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:<br>
Your loss is great, so your regard should be;<br>
My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.<br>
Upon my death the French can little boast;<br>
In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.<br>
Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;<br>
But mine it will, that no exploit have done:<br>
You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;<br>
But, if I bow, they&#8217;ll say it was for fear.<br>
There is no hope that ever I will stay,<br>
If the first hour I shrink and run away.<br>
Here on my knee I beg mortality,<br>
Rather than life preserved with infamy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Shall all thy mother&#8217;s hopes lie in one
tomb?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, rather than I&#8217;ll shame my
mother&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my blessing, I command thee go.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Part of thy father may be saved in thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">No part of him but will be shame in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse
it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Thy father&#8217;s charge shall clear thee from
that stain.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">You cannot witness for me, being slain.<br>
If death be so apparent, then both fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">And leave my followers here to fight and die?<br>
My age was never tainted with such shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?<br>
No more can I be sever&#8217;d from your side,<br>
Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:<br>
Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;<br>
For live I will not, if my father die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,<br>
Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.<br>
Come, side by side together live and die.<br>
And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.</p>

John Talbot is hemmed about, and Talbot rescues him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers,
fight.<br>
The regent hath with Talbot broke his word<br>
And left us to the rage of France his sword.<br>
Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;<br>
I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!<br>
The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,<br>
Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,<br>
To my determined time thou gavest new date.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">When from the Dauphin&#8217;s crest thy sword
struck fire,<br>
It warm&#8217;d thy father&#8217;s heart with proud desire<br>
Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,<br>
Quicken&#8217;d with youthful spleen and warlike rage,<br>
Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,<br>
And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.<br>
The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood<br>
From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood<br>
Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,<br>
And interchanging blows I quickly shed<br>
Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace<br>
Bespoke him thus; &#8216;Contaminated, base<br>
And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,<br>
Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine<br>
Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:&#8217;<br>
Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,<br>
Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father&#8217;s care,<br>
Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?<br>
Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,<br>
Now thou art seal&#8217;d the son of chivalry?<br>
Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:<br>
The help of one stands me in little stead.<br>
O, too much folly is it, well I wot,<br>
To hazard all our lives in one small boat!<br>
If I to-day die not with Frenchmen&#8217;s rage,<br>
To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:<br>
By me they nothing gain an if I stay;<br>
&#8217;Tis but the shortening of my life one day:<br>
In thee thy mother dies, our household&#8217;s name,<br>
My death&#8217;s revenge, thy youth, and England&#8217;s fame:<br>
All these and more we hazard by thy stay;<br>
All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;<br>
These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:<br>
On that advantage, bought with such a shame,<br>
To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,<br>
Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,<br>
The coward horse that bears me fail and die!<br>
And like me to the peasant boys of France,<br>
To be shame&#8217;s scorn and subject of mischance!<br>
Surely, by all the glory you have won,<br>
An if I fly, I am not Talbot&#8217;s son:<br>
Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;<br>
If son to Talbot, die at Talbot&#8217;s foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,<br>
Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:<br>
If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father&#8217;s side;<br>
And, commendable proved, let&#8217;s die in pride.</p>

O, where&#8217;s young Talbot? where is valiant John?<br>
Triumphant death, smear&#8217;d with captivity,<br>
Young Talbot&#8217;s valour makes me smile at thee:<br>
When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,<br>
His bloody sword he brandish&#8217;d over me,<br>
And, like a hungry lion, did commence<br>
Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;<br>
But when my angry guardant stood alone,<br>
Tendering my ruin and assail&#8217;d of none,<br>
Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart<br>
Suddenly made him from my side to start<br>
Into the clustering battle of the French;<br>
And in that sea of blood my boy did drench<br>
His over-mounting spirit, and there died,<br>
My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.</p>

Anon, from thy insulting tyranny,<br>
Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,<br>
Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,<br>
In thy despite shall &#8217;scape mortality.<br>
O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour&#8217;d death,<br>
Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!<br>
Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;<br>
Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.<br>
Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,<br>
Had death been French, then death had died to-day.<br>
Come, come and lay him in his father&#8217;s arms:<br>
My spirit can no longer bear these harms.<br>
Soldiers, adieu! I have what I would have,<br>

<p class="speech">Had York and Somerset brought rescue in,<br>
We should have found a bloody day of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">How the young whelp of Talbot&#8217;s,
raging-wood,<br>
Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen&#8217;s blood!</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Once I encounter&#8217;d him, and thus I
said:<br>
&#8216;Thou maiden youth, be vanquish&#8217;d by a maid:&#8217;<br>
But, with a proud majestical high scorn,<br>
He answer&#8217;d thus: &#8216;Young Talbot was not born<br>
To be the pillage of a giglot wench:&#8217;<br>
So, rushing in the bowels of the French,<br>
He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;<br>
See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms<br>
Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder<br>
Whose life was England&#8217;s glory, Gallia&#8217;s wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, forbear! for that which we have fled<br>
During the life, let us not wrong it dead.</p>

To know who hath obtained the glory of the day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">On what submissive message art thou sent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucy</p>
<p class="speech">Submission, Dauphin! &#8217;tis a mere French
word;<br>
We English warriors wot not what it means.<br>
I come to know what prisoners thou hast ta&#8217;en<br>
And to survey the bodies of the dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">For prisoners ask&#8217;st thou? hell our prison
is.<br>
But tell me whom thou seek&#8217;st.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucy</p>
<p class="speech">But where&#8217;s the great Alcides of the
field,<br>
Valiant Lord Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury,<br>
Created, for his rare success in arms,<br>
Great Earl of Washford, Waterford and Valence;<br>
Lord Talbot of Goodrig and Urchinfield,<br>
Lord Strange of Blackmere, Lord Verdun of Alton,<br>
Lord Cromwell of Wingfield, Lord Furnival of Sheffield,<br>
The thrice-victorious Lord of Falconbridge;<br>
Knight of the noble order of Saint George,<br>
Worthy Saint Michael and the Golden Fleece;<br>
Great marshal to Henry the Sixth<br>
Of all his wars within the realm of France?</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Here is a silly stately style indeed!<br>
The Turk, that two and fifty kingdoms hath,<br>
Writes not so tedious a style as this.<br>
Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles<br>
Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucy</p>
<p class="speech">Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen&#8217;s only
scourge,<br>
Your kingdom&#8217;s terror and black Nemesis?<br>
O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn&#8217;d,<br>
That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!<br>
O, that I could but call these dead to life!<br>
It were enough to fright the realm of France:<br>
Were but his picture left amongst you here,<br>
It would amaze the proudest of you all.<br>
Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence<br>
And give them burial as beseems their worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">I think this upstart is old Talbot&#8217;s
ghost,<br>
He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.<br>
For God&#8217;s sake let him have &#8217;em; to keep them here,<br>
They would but stink, and putrefy the air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>

<p class="speaker">Lucy</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll bear them hence; but from their ashes
shall be rear&#8217;d<br>
A phoenix that shall make all France afeard.</p>

All will be ours, now bloody Talbot&#8217;s slain.</p>
