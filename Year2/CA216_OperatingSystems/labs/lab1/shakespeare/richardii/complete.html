<h4>Scene I. London. King Richard II&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard II, John
Of Gaunt, with other Nobles and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour&#8217;d
Lancaster,<br>
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,<br>
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,<br>
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,<br>
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,<br>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">I have, my liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,<br>
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;<br>
Or worthily, as a good subject should,<br>
On some known ground of treachery in him?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">As near as I could sift him on that argument,<br>
On some apparent danger seen in him<br>
Aim&#8217;d at your highness, no inveterate malice.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Then call them to our presence; face to face,<br>
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear<br>
The accuser and the accused freely speak:<br>
High-stomach&#8217;d are they both, and full of ire,<br>
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Bolingbroke and
Thomas Mowbray</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Many years of happy days befal<br>
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Each day still better other&#8217;s
happiness;<br>
Until the heavens, envying earth&#8217;s good hap,<br>
Add an immortal title to your crown!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,<br>
As well appeareth by the cause you come;<br>
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.<br>
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object<br>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">First, heaven be the record to my speech!<br>
In the devotion of a subject&#8217;s love,<br>
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,<br>
And free from other misbegotten hate,<br>
Come I appellant to this princely presence.<br>
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,<br>
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak<br>
My body shall make good upon this earth,<br>
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<br>
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<br>
Too good to be so and too bad to live,<br>
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,<br>
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.<br>
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,<br>
With a foul traitor&#8217;s name stuff I thy throat;<br>
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,<br>
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:<br>
&#8217;Tis not the trial of a woman&#8217;s war,<br>
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,<br>
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;<br>
The blood is hot that must be cool&#8217;d for this:<br>
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast<br>
As to be hush&#8217;d and nought at all to say:<br>
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me<br>
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;<br>
Which else would post until it had return&#8217;d<br>
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.<br>
Setting aside his high blood&#8217;s royalty,<br>
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,<br>
I do defy him, and I spit at him;<br>
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:<br>
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,<br>
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot<br>
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,<br>
Or any other ground inhabitable,<br>
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.<br>
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,<br>
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,<br>
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,<br>
And lay aside my high blood&#8217;s royalty,<br>
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.<br>
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength<br>
As to take up mine honour&#8217;s pawn, then stoop:<br>
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,<br>
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,<br>
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">I take it up; and by that sword I swear<br>
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,<br>
I&#8217;ll answer thee in any fair degree,<br>
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:<br>
And when I mount, alive may I not light,<br>
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray&#8217;s
charge?<br>
It must be great that can inherit us<br>
So much as of a thought of ill in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it
true;<br>
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles<br>
In name of lendings for your highness&#8217; soldiers,<br>
The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,<br>
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.<br>
Besides I say and will in battle prove,<br>
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge<br>
That ever was survey&#8217;d by English eye,<br>
That all the treasons for these eighteen years<br>
Complotted and contrived in this land<br>
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.<br>
Further I say and further will maintain<br>
Upon his bad life to make all this good,<br>
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,<br>
And consequently, like a traitor coward,<br>
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:<br>
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel&#8217;s, cries,<br>
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,<br>
To me for justice and rough chastisement;<br>
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,<br>
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">How high a pitch his resolution soars!<br>
Thomas of Norfolk, what say&#8217;st thou to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">O, let my sovereign turn away his face<br>
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,<br>
Till I have told this slander of his blood,<br>
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:<br>
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom&#8217;s heir,<br>
As he is but my father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son,<br>
Now, by my sceptre&#8217;s awe, I make a vow,<br>
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood<br>
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize<br>
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:<br>
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:<br>
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,<br>
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.<br>
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais<br>
Disbursed I duly to his highness&#8217; soldiers;<br>
The other part reserved I by consent,<br>
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt<br>
Upon remainder of a dear account,<br>
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:<br>
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace<br>
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.<br>
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,<br>
The honourable father to my foe<br>
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,<br>
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul<br>
But ere I last received the sacrament<br>
I did confess it, and exactly begg&#8217;d<br>
Your grace&#8217;s pardon, and I hope I had it.<br>
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall&#8217;d,<br>
It issues from the rancour of a villain,<br>
A recreant and most degenerate traitor<br>
Which in myself I boldly will defend;<br>
And interchangeably hurl down my gage<br>
Upon this overweening traitor&#8217;s foot,<br>
To prove myself a loyal gentleman<br>
Even in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosom.<br>
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray<br>
Your highness to assign our trial day.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;<br>
Let&#8217;s purge this choler without letting blood:<br>
This we prescribe, though no physician;<br>
Deep malice makes too deep incision;<br>
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;<br>
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.<br>
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;<br>
We&#8217;ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">To be a make-peace shall become my age:<br>
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s gage.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">And, Norfolk, throw down his.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">When, Harry, when?<br>
Obedience bids I should not bid again.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no
boot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.<br>
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:<br>
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,<br>
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,<br>
To dark dishonour&#8217;s use thou shalt not have.<br>
I am disgraced, impeach&#8217;d and baffled here,<br>
Pierced to the soul with slander&#8217;s venom&#8217;d spear,<br>
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood<br>
Which breathed this poison.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Rage must be withstood:<br>
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but not change his spots: take but my
shame.<br>
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,<br>
The purest treasure mortal times afford<br>
Is spotless reputation: that away,<br>
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.<br>
A jewel in a ten-times-barr&#8217;d-up chest<br>
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.<br>
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:<br>
Take honour from me, and my life is done:<br>
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;<br>
In that I live and for that will I die.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!<br>
Shall I seem crest-fall&#8217;n in my father&#8217;s sight?<br>
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height<br>
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue<br>
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,<br>
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear<br>
The slavish motive of recanting fear,<br>
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,<br>
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray&#8217;s face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit John Of Gaunt</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We were not born to sue, but to command;<br>
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,<br>
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,<br>
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert&#8217;s day:<br>
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate<br>
The swelling difference of your settled hate:<br>
Since we can not atone you, we shall see<br>
Justice design the victor&#8217;s chivalry.<br>
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms<br>
Be ready to direct these home alarms.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The Duke Of Lancaster&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter John Of Gaunt with
Duchess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the part I had in Woodstock&#8217;s
blood<br>
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,<br>
To stir against the butchers of his life!<br>
But since correction lieth in those hands<br>
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,<br>
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;<br>
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,<br>
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders&#8217; heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?<br>
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?<br>
Edward&#8217;s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,<br>
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,<br>
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:<br>
Some of those seven are dried by nature&#8217;s course,<br>
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;<br>
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,<br>
One vial full of Edward&#8217;s sacred blood,<br>
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,<br>
Is crack&#8217;d, and all the precious liquor spilt,<br>
Is hack&#8217;d down, and his summer leaves all faded,<br>
By envy&#8217;s hand and murder&#8217;s bloody axe.<br>
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,<br>
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion&#8217;d thee<br>
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,<br>
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent<br>
In some large measure to thy father&#8217;s death,<br>
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,<br>
Who was the model of thy father&#8217;s life.<br>
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:<br>
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter&#8217;d,<br>
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,<br>
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:<br>
That which in mean men we intitle patience<br>
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.<br>
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,<br>
The best way is to venge my Gloucester&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s is the quarrel; for God&#8217;s
substitute,<br>
His deputy anointed in His sight,<br>
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,<br>
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift<br>
An angry arm against His minister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">To God, the widow&#8217;s champion and
defence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.<br>
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold<br>
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:<br>
O, sit my husband&#8217;s wrongs on Hereford&#8217;s spear,<br>
That it may enter butcher Mowbray&#8217;s breast!<br>
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,<br>
Be Mowbray&#8217;s sins so heavy in his bosom,<br>
They may break his foaming courser&#8217;s back,<br>
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,<br>
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!<br>
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother&#8217;s wife<br>
With her companion grief must end her life.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:<br>
As much good stay with thee as go with me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it
falls,<br>
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:<br>
I take my leave before I have begun,<br>
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.<br>
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.<br>
Lo, this is all:&#8212;nay, yet depart not so;<br>
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;<br>
I shall remember more. Bid him&#8212;ah, what?&#8212;<br>
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.<br>
Alack, and what shall good old York there see<br>
But empty lodgings and unfurnish&#8217;d walls,<br>
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?<br>
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?<br>
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,<br>
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.<br>
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:<br>
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</p>

<p class="speech">Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,<br>
Both who he is and why he cometh hither<br>
Thus plated in habiliments of war,<br>
And formally, according to our law,<br>
Depose him in the justice of his cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou
hither,<br>
Before King Richard in his royal lists?<br>
Against whom comest thou? and what&#8217;s thy quarrel?<br>
Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby<br>
Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,<br>
To prove, by God&#8217;s grace and my body&#8217;s valour,<br>
In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,<br>
That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,<br>
To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;<br>
And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">On pain of death, no person be so bold<br>
Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,<br>
Except the marshal and such officers<br>
Appointed to direct these fair designs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign&#8217;s
hand,<br>
And bow my knee before his majesty:<br>
For Mowbray and myself are like two men<br>
That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;<br>
Then let us take a ceremonious leave<br>
And loving farewell of our several friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">The appellant in all duty greets your
highness,<br>
And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We will descend and fold him in our arms.<br>
Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,<br>
So be thy fortune in this royal fight!<br>
Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,<br>
Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">O let no noble eye profane a tear<br>
For me, if I be gored with Mowbray&#8217;s spear:<br>
As confident as is the falcon&#8217;s flight<br>
Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.<br>
My loving lord, I take my leave of you;<br>
Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;<br>
Not sick, although I have to do with death,<br>
But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.<br>
Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet<br>
The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:<br>
O thou, the earthly author of my blood,<br>
Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,<br>
Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up<br>
To reach at victory above my head,<br>
Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;<br>
And with thy blessings steel my lance&#8217;s point,<br>
That it may enter Mowbray&#8217;s waxen coat,<br>
And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,<br>
Even in the lusty havior of his son.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!<br>
Be swift like lightning in the execution;<br>
And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,<br>
Fall like amazing thunder on the casque<br>
Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:<br>
Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">However God or fortune cast my lot,<br>
There lives or dies, true to King Richard&#8217;s throne,<br>
A loyal, just and upright gentleman:<br>
Never did captive with a freer heart<br>
Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace<br>
His golden uncontroll&#8217;d enfranchisement,<br>
More than my dancing soul doth celebrate<br>
This feast of battle with mine adversary.<br>
Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,<br>
Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:<br>
As gentle and as jocund as to jest<br>
Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my lord: securely I espy<br>
Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.<br>
Order the trial, marshal, and begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,<br>
Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of
Norfolk.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Herald</p>
<p class="speech">Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,<br>
Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,<br>
On pain to be found false and recreant,<br>
To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,<br>
A traitor to his God, his king and him;<br>
And dares him to set forward to the fight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Herald</p>
<p class="speech">Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
Norfolk,<br>
On pain to be found false and recreant,<br>
Both to defend himself and to approve<br>
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,<br>
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;<br>
Courageously and with a free desire<br>
Attending but the signal to begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A charge sounded</span></p>
<p class="speech">Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Let them lay by their helmets and their
spears,<br>
And both return back to their chairs again:<br>
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound<br>
While we return these dukes what we decree.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A long flourish</span></p>
<p class="speech">Draw near,<br>
And list what with our council we have done.<br>
For that our kingdom&#8217;s earth should not be soil&#8217;d<br>
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;<br>
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect<br>
Of civil wounds plough&#8217;d up with neighbours&#8217; sword;<br>
And for we think the eagle-winged pride<br>
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,<br>
With rival-hating envy, set on you<br>
To wake our peace, which in our country&#8217;s cradle<br>
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;<br>
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,<br>
With harsh resounding trumpets&#8217; dreadful bray,<br>
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,<br>
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace<br>
And make us wade even in our kindred&#8217;s blood,<br>
Therefore, we banish you our territories:<br>
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,<br>
Till twice five summers have enrich&#8217;d our fields<br>
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,<br>
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Your will be done: this must my comfort be,<br>
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;<br>
And those his golden beams to you here lent<br>
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,<br>
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:<br>
The sly slow hours shall not determinate<br>
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;<br>
The hopeless word of &#8216;never to return&#8217;<br>
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,<br>
And all unlook&#8217;d for from your highness&#8217; mouth:<br>
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim<br>
As to be cast forth in the common air,<br>
Have I deserved at your highness&#8217; hands.<br>
The language I have learn&#8217;d these forty years,<br>
My native English, now I must forego:<br>
And now my tongue&#8217;s use is to me no more<br>
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,<br>
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,<br>
Or, being open, put into his hands<br>
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:<br>
Within my mouth you have engaol&#8217;d my tongue,<br>
Doubly portcullis&#8217;d with my teeth and lips;<br>
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance<br>
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.<br>
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,<br>
Too far in years to be a pupil now:<br>
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,<br>
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">It boots thee not to be compassionate:<br>
After our sentence plaining comes too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus I turn me from my country&#8217;s
light,<br>
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Return again, and take an oath with thee.<br>
Lay on our royal sword your banish&#8217;d hands;<br>
Swear by the duty that you owe to God&#8212;<br>
Our part therein we banish with yourselves&#8212;<br>
To keep the oath that we administer:<br>
You never shall, so help you truth and God!<br>
Embrace each other&#8217;s love in banishment;<br>
Nor never look upon each other&#8217;s face;<br>
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile<br>
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;<br>
Nor never by advised purpose meet<br>
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill<br>
&#8217;Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">And I, to keep all this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:&#8212;<br>
By this time, had the king permitted us,<br>
One of our souls had wander&#8217;d in the air.<br>
Banish&#8217;d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,<br>
As now our flesh is banish&#8217;d from this land:<br>
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;<br>
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along<br>
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,<br>
My name be blotted from the book of life,<br>
And I from heaven banish&#8217;d as from hence!<br>
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;<br>
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.<br>
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;<br>
Save back to England, all the world&#8217;s my way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes<br>
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect<br>
Hath from the number of his banish&#8217;d years<br>
Pluck&#8217;d four away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Henry
Bolingbroke</span></p>
<p class="speech">Six frozen winter spent,<br>
Return with welcome home from banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">How long a time lies in one little word!<br>
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs<br>
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">I thank my liege, that in regard of me<br>
He shortens four years of my son&#8217;s exile:<br>
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;<br>
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend<br>
Can change their moons and bring their times about<br>
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light<br>
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;<br>
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,<br>
And blindfold death not let me see my son.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:<br>
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,<br>
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;<br>
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,<br>
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;<br>
Thy word is current with him for my death,<br>
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thy son is banish&#8217;d upon good advice,<br>
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:<br>
Why at our justice seem&#8217;st thou then to lour?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Things sweet to taste prove in digestion
sour.<br>
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather<br>
You would have bid me argue like a father.<br>
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,<br>
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:<br>
A partial slander sought I to avoid,<br>
And in the sentence my own life destroy&#8217;d.<br>
Alas, I look&#8217;d when some of you should say,<br>
I was too strict to make mine own away;<br>
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue<br>
Against my will to do myself this wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:<br>
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt King Richard
II and train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, farewell: what presence must not
know,<br>
From where you do remain let paper show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,<br>
As far as land will let me, by your side.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,<br>
That thou return&#8217;st no greeting to thy friends?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I have too few to take my leave of you,<br>
When the tongue&#8217;s office should be prodigal<br>
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">What is six winters? they are quickly gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Call it a travel that thou takest for
pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,<br>
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">The sullen passage of thy weary steps<br>
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set<br>
The precious jewel of thy home return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make<br>
Will but remember me what a deal of world<br>
I wander from the jewels that I love.<br>
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood<br>
To foreign passages, and in the end,<br>
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else<br>
But that I was a journeyman to grief?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">All places that the eye of heaven visits<br>
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.<br>
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;<br>
There is no virtue like necessity.<br>
Think not the king did banish thee,<br>
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,<br>
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.<br>
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour<br>
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose<br>
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air<br>
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:<br>
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it<br>
To lie that way thou go&#8217;st, not whence thou comest:<br>
Suppose the singing birds musicians,<br>
The grass whereon thou tread&#8217;st the presence
strew&#8217;d,<br>
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more<br>
Than a delightful measure or a dance;<br>
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite<br>
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">O, who can hold a fire in his hand<br>
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?<br>
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite<br>
By bare imagination of a feast?<br>
Or wallow naked in December snow<br>
By thinking on fantastic summer&#8217;s heat?<br>
O, no! the apprehension of the good<br>
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:<br>
Fell sorrow&#8217;s tooth doth never rankle more<br>
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, my son, I&#8217;ll bring thee on thy
way:<br>
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Then, England&#8217;s ground, farewell; sweet
soil, adieu;<br>
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!<br>
Where&#8217;er I wander, boast of this I can,<br>
Though banish&#8217;d, yet a trueborn Englishman.</p>

How far brought you high Hereford on his way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,<br>
But to the next highway, and there I left him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>

shed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, none for me; except the north-east
wind,<br>
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,<br>
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance<br>
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What said our cousin when you parted with
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Farewell:&#8217;<br>
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue<br>
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft<br>
To counterfeit oppression of such grief<br>
That words seem&#8217;d buried in my sorrow&#8217;s grave.<br>
Marry, would the word &#8216;farewell&#8217; have lengthen&#8217;d
hours<br>

He should have had a volume of farewells;<br>
But since it would not, he had none of me.</p>

<p class="speech">He is our cousin, cousin; but &#8217;tis
doubt,<br>
When time shall call him home from banishment,<br>
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.<br>
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green<br>
Observed his courtship to the common people;<br>
How he did seem to dive into their hearts<br>
With humble and familiar courtesy,<br>
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,<br>
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles<br>
And patient underbearing of his fortune,<br>
As &#8217;twere to banish their affects with him.<br>
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;<br>
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well<br>
And had the tribute of his supple knee,<br>
With &#8216;Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;&#8217;<br>

For our affairs in hand: if that come short,<br>

Report of fashions in proud Italy,<br>

Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity&#8212;<br>
So it be new, there&#8217;s no respect how vile&#8212;<br>

Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;<br>
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;<br>
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:<br>
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,<br>
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.<br>
This royal throne of kings, this scepter&#8217;d isle,<br>

Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege<br>
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,<br>

Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.<br>
Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,<br>
How happy then were my ensuing death!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard II and
Queen, Duke Of Aumerle, Bushy, Green, Bagot, Lord Ross, and Lord
Willoughby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;<br>
For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What comfort, man? how is&#8217;t with aged
Gaunt?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">O how that name befits my composition!<br>
Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:<br>
Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;<br>
And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?<br>
For sleeping England long time have I watch&#8217;d;<br>
Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:<br>
The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,<br>
Is my strict fast; I mean, my children&#8217;s looks;<br>
And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:<br>
Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,<br>
Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">No, misery makes sport to mock itself:<br>
Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,<br>
I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Should dying men flatter with those that
live?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, men living flatter those that die.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, now a-dying, say&#8217;st thou flatterest
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;<br>
Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.<br>
Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land<br>
Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;<br>
And thou, too careless patient as thou art,<br>
Commit&#8217;st thy anointed body to the cure<br>
Of those physicians that first wounded thee:<br>
A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,<br>
Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;<br>
And yet, incaged in so small a verge,<br>
The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.<br>
O, had thy grandsire with a prophet&#8217;s eye<br>
Seen how his son&#8217;s son should destroy his sons,<br>
From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,<br>
Deposing thee before thou wert possess&#8217;d,<br>
Which art possess&#8217;d now to depose thyself.<br>
Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,<br>
It were a shame to let this land by lease;<br>
But for thy world enjoying but this land,<br>
Is it not more than shame to shame it so?<br>
Landlord of England art thou now, not king:<br>
Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A lunatic lean-witted fool,<br>
Presuming on an ague&#8217;s privilege,<br>
Darest with thy frozen admonition<br>
Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood<br>
With fury from his native residence.<br>
Now, by my seat&#8217;s right royal majesty,<br>
Wert thou not brother to great Edward&#8217;s son,<br>
This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head<br>
Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">O, spare me not, my brother Edward&#8217;s
son,<br>
For that I was his father Edward&#8217;s son;<br>
That blood already, like the pelican,<br>
Hast thou tapp&#8217;d out and drunkenly caroused:<br>
My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,<br>
Whom fair befal in heaven &#8217;mongst happy souls!<br>
May be a precedent and witness good<br>
That thou respect&#8217;st not spilling Edward&#8217;s blood:<br>
Join with the present sickness that I have;<br>
And thy unkindness be like crooked age,<br>
To crop at once a too long wither&#8217;d flower.<br>
Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!<br>
These words hereafter thy tormentors be!<br>
Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:<br>
Love they to live that love and honour have.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, borne off by his
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">And let them die that age and sullens have;<br>
For both hast thou, and both become the grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech your majesty, impute his words<br>
To wayward sickliness and age in him:<br>
He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear<br>
As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Right, you say true: as Hereford&#8217;s love, so
his;<br>
As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter
Northumberland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your
majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What says he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, nothing; all is said<br>
His tongue is now a stringless instrument;<br>
Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!<br>
Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;<br>
His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.<br>
So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:<br>
We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,<br>
Which live like venom where no venom else<br>
But only they have privilege to live.<br>
And for these great affairs do ask some charge,<br>
Towards our assistance we do seize to us<br>
The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,<br>
Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">How long shall I be patient? ah, how long<br>
Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?<br>
Not Gloucester&#8217;s death, nor Hereford&#8217;s banishment<br>
Not Gaunt&#8217;s rebukes, nor England&#8217;s private wrongs,<br>
Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke<br>
About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,<br>
Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,<br>
Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign&#8217;s face.<br>
I am the last of noble Edward&#8217;s sons,<br>
Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:<br>
In war was never lion raged more fierce,<br>
In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,<br>
Than was that young and princely gentleman.<br>
His face thou hast, for even so look&#8217;d he,<br>
Accomplish&#8217;d with the number of thy hours;<br>
But when he frown&#8217;d, it was against the French<br>
And not against his friends; his noble hand<br>
Did will what he did spend and spent not that<br>
Which his triumphant father&#8217;s hand had won;<br>
His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,<br>
But bloody with the enemies of his kin.<br>
O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,<br>
Or else he never would compare between.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Why, uncle, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">O my liege,<br>
Pardon me, if you please; if n ot, I, pleased<br>
Not to be pardon&#8217;d, am content withal.<br>
Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands<br>
The royalties and rights of banish&#8217;d Hereford?<br>
Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?<br>
Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?<br>
Did not the one deserve to have an heir?<br>
Is not his heir a well-deserving son?<br>
Take Hereford&#8217;s rights away, and take from Time<br>
His charters and his customary rights;<br>
Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;<br>
Be not thyself; for how art thou a king<br>
But by fair sequence and succession?<br>
Now, afore God&#8212;God forbid I say true!&#8212;<br>
If you do wrongfully seize Hereford&#8217;s rights,<br>
Call in the letters patent that he hath<br>
By his attorneys-general to sue<br>
His livery, and deny his offer&#8217;d homage,<br>
You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,<br>
You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts<br>
And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts<br>
Which honour and allegiance cannot think.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Think what you will, we seize into our hands<br>
His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not be by the while: my liege,
farewell:<br>
What will ensue hereof, there&#8217;s none can tell;<br>
But by bad courses may be understood<br>
That their events can never fall out good.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:<br>
Bid him repair to us to Ely House<br>
To see this business. To-morrow next<br>
We will for Ireland; and &#8217;tis time, I trow:<br>
And we create, in absence of ourself,<br>
Our uncle York lord governor of England;<br>
For he is just and always loved us well.<br>
Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;<br>
Be merry, for our time of stay is short</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt King Richard
II, Queen, Duke Of Aumerle, Bushy, Green, and Bagot</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">And living too; for now his son is duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">Barely in title, not in revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Richly in both, if justice had her right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">My heart is great; but it must break with
silence,<br>
Ere&#8217;t be disburden&#8217;d with a liberal tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne&#8217;er
speak more<br>
That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of
Hereford?<br>
If it be so, out with it boldly, man;<br>
Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">No good at all that I can do for him;<br>
Unless you call it good to pity him,<br>
Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Now, afore God, &#8217;tis shame such wrongs are
borne<br>
In him, a royal prince, and many moe<br>
Of noble blood in this declining land.<br>
The king is not himself, but basely led<br>
By flatterers; and what they will inform,<br>
Merely in hate, &#8217;gainst any of us all,<br>
That will the king severely prosecute<br>
&#8217;Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">The commons hath he pill&#8217;d with grievous
taxes,<br>
And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined<br>
For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">And daily new exactions are devised,<br>
As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:<br>
But what, o&#8217; God&#8217;s name, doth become of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Wars have not wasted it, for warr&#8217;d he hath
not,<br>
But basely yielded upon compromise<br>
That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:<br>
More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">The king&#8217;s grown bankrupt, like a broken
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">He hath not money for these Irish wars,<br>
His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,<br>
But by the robbing of the banish&#8217;d duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!<br>
But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,<br>
Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;<br>
We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,<br>
And yet we strike not, but securely perish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">We see the very wreck that we must suffer;<br>
And unavoided is the danger now,<br>
For suffering so the causes of our wreck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death<br>
I spy life peering; but I dare not say<br>
How near the tidings of our comfort is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost
ours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Be confident to speak, Northumberland:<br>
We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,<br>
Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay<br>
In Brittany, received intelligence<br>
That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,<br>
That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,<br>
His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,<br>
Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,<br>
Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,<br>
All these well furnish&#8217;d by the Duke of Bretagne<br>
With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,<br>
Are making hither with all due expedience<br>
And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:<br>
Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay<br>
The first departing of the king for Ireland.<br>
If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,<br>
Imp out our drooping country&#8217;s broken wing,<br>
Redeem from broking pawn the blemish&#8217;d crown,<br>
Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre&#8217;s gilt<br>
And make high majesty look like itself,<br>
Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;<br>
But if you faint, as fearing to do so,<br>
Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that
fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen, Bushy, and
Bagot</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, your majesty is too much sad:<br>
You promised, when you parted with the king,<br>
To lay aside life-harming heaviness<br>
And entertain a cheerful disposition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">To please the king I did; to please myself<br>
I cannot do it; yet I know no cause<br>
Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,<br>
Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest<br>
As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,<br>
Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune&#8217;s womb,<br>
Is coming towards me, and my inward soul<br>
With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,<br>
More than with parting from my lord the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Each substance of a grief hath twenty
shadows,<br>
Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;<br>
For sorrow&#8217;s eye, glazed with blinding tears,<br>
Divides one thing entire to many objects;<br>
Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon<br>
Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry<br>
Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,<br>
Looking awry upon your lord&#8217;s departure,<br>
Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;<br>
Which, look&#8217;d on as it is, is nought but shadows<br>
Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,<br>
More than your lord&#8217;s departure weep not: more&#8217;s not
seen;<br>
Or if it be, &#8217;tis with false sorrow&#8217;s eye,<br>
Which for things true weeps things imaginary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so; but yet my inward soul<br>
Persuades me it is otherwise: howe&#8217;er it be,<br>
I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad<br>
As, though on thinking on no thought I think,<br>
Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis nothing less: conceit is still
derived<br>
From some forefather grief; mine is not so,<br>
For nothing had begot my something grief;<br>
Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:<br>
&#8217;Tis in reversion that I do possess;<br>
But what it is, that is not yet known; what<br>
I cannot name; &#8217;tis nameless woe, I wot.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Green</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">God save your majesty! and well met,
gentlemen:<br>
I hope the king is not yet shipp&#8217;d for Ireland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Why hopest thou so? &#8217;tis better hope he
is;<br>
For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:<br>
Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">That he, our hope, might have retired his
power,<br>
And driven into despair an enemy&#8217;s hope,<br>
Who strongly hath set footing in this land:<br>
The banish&#8217;d Bolingbroke repeals himself,<br>
And with uplifted arms is safe arrived<br>
At Ravenspurgh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now God in heaven forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, madam, &#8217;tis too true: and that is
worse,<br>
The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,<br>
The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,<br>
With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Why have you not proclaim&#8217;d
Northumberland<br>
And all the rest revolted faction traitors?</p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester<br>
Hath broke his staff, resign&#8217;d his stewardship,<br>
And all the household servants fled with him<br>
To Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,<br>
And Bolingbroke my sorrow&#8217;s dismal heir:<br>
Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,<br>
And I, a gasping new-deliver&#8217;d mother,<br>
Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Despair not, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">Who shall hinder me?<br>
I will despair, and be at enmity<br>
With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,<br>
A parasite, a keeper back of death,<br>
Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,<br>
Which false hope lingers in extremity.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of York</span></p>

<p class="speech">Here comes the Duke of York.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>

O, full of careful business are his looks!<br>
Uncle, for God&#8217;s sake, speak comfortable words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:<br>
Comfort&#8217;s in heaven; and we are on the earth,<br>
Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.<br>
Your husband, he is gone to save far off,<br>
Whilst others come to make him lose at home:<br>
Here am I left to underprop his land,<br>
Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:<br>
Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;<br>
Now shall he try his friends that flatter&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>

The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,<br>
And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford&#8217;s side.<br>
Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;<br>
Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:<br>
Hold, take my ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,<br>
To-day, as I came by, I called there;<br>
But I shall grieve you to report the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t, knave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">An hour before I came, the duchess died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>

I know not what to do: I would to God,<br>
So my untruth had not provoked him to it,<br>
The king had cut off my head with my brother&#8217;s.<br>
What, are there no posts dispatch&#8217;d for Ireland?<br>
How shall we do for money for these wars?<br>
Come, sister,&#8212;cousin, I would say&#8212;pray, pardon me.<br>
Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts<br>
And bring away the armour that is there.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Gentlemen, will you go muster men?<br>
If I know how or which way to order these affairs<br>
Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,<br>
Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:<br>
The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath<br>
And duty bids defend; the other again<br>
Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong&#8217;d,<br>
Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.<br>
Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I&#8217;ll<br>
Dispose of you.<br>
Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,<br>
And meet me presently at Berkeley.<br>
I should to Plashy too;<br>
But time will not permit: all is uneven,<br>

<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,<br>
But none returns. For us to levy power<br>
Proportionable to the enemy<br>
Is all unpossible.</p>

Is near the hate of those love not the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>

Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them<br>
By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.</p>

Because we ever have been near the king.</p>

<p class="speech">Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol
castle:<br>
The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Thither will I with you; for little office<br>
The hateful commons will perform for us,<br>
Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.<br>
Will you go along with us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>
<p class="speech">No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.<br>
Farewell: if heart&#8217;s presages be not vain,<br>
We three here art that ne&#8217;er shall meet again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as York thrives to beat back
Bolingbroke.</p>

Northumberland, with Forces</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, noble lord,<br>
I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:<br>
These high wild hills and rough uneven ways<br>
Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,<br>
And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,<br>
Making the hard way sweet and delectable.<br>
But I bethink me what a weary way<br>
From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found<br>
In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,<br>
Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled<br>
The tediousness and process of my travel:<br>
But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have<br>
The present benefit which I possess;<br>
And hope to joy is little less in joy<br>
Than hope enjoy&#8217;d: by this the weary lords<br>
Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done<br>
By sight of what I have, your noble company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Of much less value is my company<br>
Than your good words. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Percy</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">It is my son, young Harry Percy,<br>
Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.<br>
Harry, how fares your uncle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">I had thought, my lord, to have learn&#8217;d his
health of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Why, is he not with the queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,<br>
Broken his staff of office and dispersed<br>
The household of the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">What was his reason?<br>
He was not so resolved when last we spake together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.<br>
But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,<br>
To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,<br>
And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover<br>
What power the Duke of York had levied there;<br>
Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord, for that is not forgot<br>
Which ne&#8217;er I did remember: to my knowledge,<br>
I never in my life did look on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, I tender you my service,<br>
Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:<br>
Which elder days shall ripen and confirm<br>
To more approved service and desert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure<br>
I count myself in nothing else so happy<br>
As in a soul remembering my good friends;<br>
And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,<br>
It shall be still thy true love&#8217;s recompense:<br>
My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir<br>
Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">There stands the castle, by yon tuft of
trees,<br>
Mann&#8217;d with three hundred men, as I have heard;<br>
And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;<br>
None else of name and noble estimate.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lord Ross and Lord
Willoughby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,<br>
Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues<br>
A banish&#8217;d traitor: all my treasury<br>
Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich&#8217;d<br>
Shall be your love and labour&#8217;s recompense.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">And far surmounts our labour to attain it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;<br>
Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,<br>
Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lord
Berkeley</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Berkeley</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, my answer is&#8212;to Lancaster;<br>
And I am come to seek that name in England;<br>
And I must find that title in your tongue,<br>
Before I make reply to aught you say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Berkeley</p>
<p class="speech">Mistake me not, my lord; &#8217;tis not my
meaning<br>
To raze one title of your honour out:<br>
To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,<br>
From the most gracious regent of this land,<br>
The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on<br>
To take advantage of the absent time<br>
And fright our native peace with self-born arms.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of York
attended</span></p>

Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,<br>
Whose duty is deceiveable and false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious uncle&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, tut!<br>
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:<br>
I am no traitor&#8217;s uncle; and that word
&#8216;grace.&#8217;<br>
In an ungracious mouth is but profane.<br>
Why have those banish&#8217;d and forbidden legs<br>
Dared once to touch a dust of England&#8217;s ground?<br>
But then more &#8216;why?&#8217; why have they dared to march<br>
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,<br>
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war<br>
And ostentation of despised arms?<br>
Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?<br>
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,<br>
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.<br>
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth<br>
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself<br>
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,<br>
From forth the ranks of many thousand French,<br>
O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.<br>
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee<br>
And minister correction to thy fault!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:<br>
On what condition stands it and wherein?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Even in condition of the worst degree,<br>
In gross rebellion and detested treason:<br>
Thou art a banish&#8217;d man, and here art come<br>
Before the expiration of thy time,<br>
In braving arms against thy sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">As I was banish&#8217;d, I was banish&#8217;d
Hereford;<br>
But as I come, I come for Lancaster.<br>
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace<br>
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:<br>
You are my father, for methinks in you<br>
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,<br>
Will you permit that I shall stand condemn&#8217;d<br>
A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties<br>
Pluck&#8217;d from my arms perforce and given away<br>
To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?<br>
If that my cousin king be King of England,<br>
It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.<br>
You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;<br>
Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,<br>
He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,<br>
To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.<br>
I am denied to sue my livery here,<br>
And yet my letters-patents give me leave:<br>
My father&#8217;s goods are all distrain&#8217;d and sold,<br>
And these and all are all amiss employ&#8217;d.<br>
What would you have me do? I am a subject,<br>
And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;<br>
And therefore, personally I lay my claim<br>
To my inheritance of free descent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">The noble duke hath been too much abused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Ross</p>
<p class="speech">It stands your grace upon to do him right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Willoughby</p>
<p class="speech">Base men by his endowments are made great.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">My lords of England, let me tell you this:<br>
I have had feeling of my cousin&#8217;s wrongs<br>
And laboured all I could to do him right;<br>
But in this kind to come, in braving arms,<br>
Be his own carver and cut out his way,<br>
To find out right with wrong, it may not be;<br>
And you that do abet him in this kind<br>
Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">The noble duke hath sworn his coming is<br>
But for his own; and for the right of that<br>
We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;<br>
And let him ne&#8217;er see joy that breaks that oath!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:<br>
I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,<br>
Because my power is weak and all ill left:<br>
But if I could, by Him that gave me life,<br>
I would attach you all and make you stoop<br>
Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;<br>
But since I cannot, be it known to you<br>
I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;<br>
Unless you please to enter in the castle<br>
And there repose you for this night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">An offer, uncle, that we will accept:<br>
But we must win your grace to go with us<br>
To Bristol castle, which they say is held<br>
By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,<br>
The caterpillars of the commonwealth,<br>
Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">It may be I will go with you: but yet I&#8217;ll
pause;<br>
For I am loath to break our country&#8217;s laws.<br>
Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:<br>
Things past redress are now with me past care.</p>

I will unfold some causes of your deaths.<br>
You have misled a prince, a royal king,<br>
A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,<br>
By you unhappied and disfigured clean:<br>
You have in manner with your sinful hours<br>
Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,<br>
Broke the possession of a royal bed<br>

With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.<br>
Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,<br>
Near to the king in blood, and near in love<br>
Till you did make him misinterpret me,<br>
Have stoop&#8217;d my neck under your injuries,<br>
And sigh&#8217;d my English breath in foreign clouds,<br>
Eating the bitter bread of banishment;<br>
Whilst you have fed upon my signories,<br>
Dispark&#8217;d my parks and fell&#8217;d my forest woods,<br>
From my own windows torn my household coat,<br>
Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,<br>
Save men&#8217;s opinions and my living blood,<br>
To show the world I am a gentleman.<br>
This and much more, much more than twice all this,<br>
Condemns you to the death. See them deliver&#8217;d over<br>
To execution and the hand of death.</p>

As a long-parted mother with her child<br>
Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,<br>
So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,<br>

Feed not thy sovereign&#8217;s foe, my gentle earth,<br>

In murders and in outrage, boldly here;<br>
But when from under this terrestrial ball<br>

And darts his light through every guilty hole,<br>
Then murders, treasons and detested sins,<br>

But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.<br>
Not all the water in the rough rude sea<br>

And yet not so, for what can we bequeath<br>
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?<br>
Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke&#8217;s,<br>
And nothing can we call our own but death<br>
And that small model of the barren earth<br>
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.<br>
For God&#8217;s sake, let us sit upon the ground<br>
And tell sad stories of the death of kings;<br>
How some have been deposed; some slain in war,<br>
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;<br>
Some poison&#8217;d by their wives: some sleeping kill&#8217;d;<br>
All murder&#8217;d: for within the hollow crown<br>
That rounds the mortal temples of a king<br>
Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,<br>
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,<br>
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,<br>
To monarchize, be fear&#8217;d and kill with looks,<br>
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,<br>
As if this flesh which walls about our life,<br>
Were brass impregnable, and humour&#8217;d thus<br>
Comes at the last and with a little pin<br>
Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!<br>
Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood<br>
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,<br>
Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,<br>
For you have but mistook me all this while:<br>
I live with bread like you, feel want,<br>
Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,<br>
How can you say to me, I am a king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, wise men ne&#8217;er sit and wail their
woes,<br>
But presently prevent the ways to wail.<br>
To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,<br>
Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,<br>
And so your follies fight against yourself.<br>
Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:<br>
And fight and die is death destroying death;<br>
Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">My father hath a power; inquire of him<br>
And learn to make a body of a limb.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I
come<br>
To change blows with thee for our day of doom.<br>
This ague fit of fear is over-blown;<br>
An easy task it is to win our own.<br>
Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?<br>
Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Stephen Scroop</p>
<p class="speech">Men judge by the complexion of the sky<br>
The state and inclination of the day:<br>
So may you by my dull and heavy eye,<br>
My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.<br>
I play the torturer, by small and small<br>
To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:<br>
Your uncle York is join&#8217;d with Bolingbroke,<br>
And all your northern castles yielded up,<br>
And all your southern gentlemen in arms<br>
Upon his party.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>

What say you now? what comfort have we now?<br>
By heaven, I&#8217;ll hate him everlastingly<br>
That bids me be of comfort any more.<br>
Go to Flint castle: there I&#8217;ll pine away;<br>
A king, woe&#8217;s slave, shall kingly woe obey.<br>
That power I have, discharge; and let them go<br>
To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,<br>
For I have none: let no man speak again<br>
To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</p>

Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.</p>

Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;<br>
Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley<br>
Into his ruin&#8217;d ears, and thus deliver:<br>
Henry Bolingbroke<br>
On both his knees doth kiss King Richard&#8217;s hand<br>
And sends allegiance and true faith of heart<br>
To his most royal person, hither come<br>
Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,<br>
Provided that my banishment repeal&#8217;d<br>
And lands restored again be freely granted:<br>
If not, I&#8217;ll use the advantage of my power<br>
And lay the summer&#8217;s dust with showers of blood<br>
Rain&#8217;d from the wounds of slaughter&#8217;d Englishmen:<br>
The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke<br>
It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench<br>
The fresh green lap of fair King Richard&#8217;s land,<br>
My stooping duty tenderly shall show.<br>
Go, signify as much, while here we march<br>
Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.<br>
Let&#8217;s march without the noise of threatening drum,<br>
That from this castle&#8217;s tatter&#8217;d battlements<br>
Our fair appointments may be well perused.<br>
Methinks King Richard and myself should meet<br>
With no less terror than the elements<br>
Of fire and water, when their thundering shock<br>
At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.<br>
Be he the fire, I&#8217;ll be the yielding water:<br>
The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain<br>
My waters; on the earth, and not on him.<br>

And if we be, how dare thy joints forget<br>
To pay their awful duty to our presence?<br>
If we be not, show us the hand of God<br>
That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;<br>
For well we know, no hand of blood and bone<br>
Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,<br>
Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.<br>
And though you think that all, as you have done,<br>
Have torn their souls by turning them from us,<br>
And we are barren and bereft of friends;<br>
Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,<br>
Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf<br>
Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike<br>
Your children yet unborn and unbegot,<br>
That lift your vassal hands against my head<br>
And threat the glory of my precious crown.<br>
Tell Bolingbroke&#8212;for yond methinks he stands&#8212;<br>
That every stride he makes upon my land<br>
Is dangerous treason: he is come to open<br>
The purple testament of bleeding war;<br>
But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,<br>
Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers&#8217; sons<br>
Shall ill become the flower of England&#8217;s face,<br>

And by the honourable tomb he swears,<br>
That stands upon your royal grandsire&#8217;s bones,<br>
And by the royalties of both your bloods,<br>
Currents that spring from one most gracious head,<br>
And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,<br>
And by the worth and honour of himself,<br>
Comprising all that may be sworn or said,<br>
His coming hither hath no further scope<br>
Than for his lineal royalties and to beg<br>
Enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees:<br>
Which on thy royal party granted once,<br>
His glittering arms he will commend to rust,<br>
His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart<br>
To faithful service of your majesty.<br>

His noble cousin is right welcome hither;<br>
And all the number of his fair demands<br>

With all the gracious utterance thou hast<br>
Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.<br>
We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Duke Of Aumerle</span></p>

Shall we call back Northumberland, and send<br>
Defiance to the traitor, and so die?</p>

<p class="speech">No, good my lord; let&#8217;s fight with gentle
words<br>
Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.</p>

<p class="speech">O God, O God! that e&#8217;er this tongue of
mine,<br>
That laid the sentence of dread banishment<br>
On yon proud man, should take it off again<br>
With words of sooth! O that I were as great<br>
As is my grief, or lesser than my name!<br>
Or that I could forget what I have been,<br>
Or not remember what I must be now!<br>
Swell&#8217;st thou, proud heart? I&#8217;ll give thee scope to

The name of king? o&#8217; God&#8217;s name, let it go:<br>
I&#8217;ll give my jewels for a set of beads,<br>
My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,<br>
My gay apparel for an almsman&#8217;s gown,<br>
My figured goblets for a dish of wood,<br>
My sceptre for a palmer&#8217;s walking staff,<br>
My subjects for a pair of carved saints<br>
And my large kingdom for a little grave,<br>
A little little grave, an obscure grave;<br>
Or I&#8217;ll be buried in the king&#8217;s highway,<br>
Some way of common trade, where subjects&#8217; feet<br>
May hourly trample on their sovereign&#8217;s head;<br>
For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;<br>
And buried once, why not upon my head?<br>
Aumerle, thou weep&#8217;st, my tender-hearted cousin!<br>
We&#8217;ll make foul weather with despised tears;<br>
Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,<br>
And make a dearth in this revolting land.<br>
Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,<br>
And make some pretty match with shedding tears?<br>
As thus, to drop them still upon one place,<br>
Till they have fretted us a pair of graves<br>
Within the earth; and, therein laid,&#8212;there lies<br>
Two kinsmen digg&#8217;d their graves with weeping eyes.<br>
Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see<br>
I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.<br>
Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,<br>
What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty<br>
Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?<br>
You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.</p>

To speak with you; may it please you to come down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,<br>
Wanting the manage of unruly jades.<br>
In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,<br>
To come at traitors&#8217; calls and do them grace.<br>
In the base court? Come down? Down, court!

That know the strong&#8217;st and surest way to get.<br>
Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;<br>
Tears show their love, but want their remedies.<br>
Cousin, I am too young to be your father,<br>
Though you are old enough to be my heir.<br>
What you will have, I&#8217;ll give, and willing too;<br>
For do we must what force will have us do.<br>

Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;<br>
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform&#8217;d<br>
The bloody office of his timeless end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>
<p class="speech">Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue<br>
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver&#8217;d.<br>
In that dead time when Gloucester&#8217;s death was plotted,<br>
I heard you say, &#8216;Is not my arm of length,<br>
That reacheth from the restful English court<br>
As far as Calais, to mine uncle&#8217;s head?&#8217;<br>
Amongst much other talk, that very time,<br>
I heard you say that you had rather refuse<br>
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns<br>
Than Bolingbroke&#8217;s return to England;<br>
Adding withal how blest this land would be<br>
In this your cousin&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Princes and noble lords,<br>
What answer shall I make to this base man?<br>
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,<br>
On equal terms to give him chastisement?<br>
Either I must, or have mine honour soil&#8217;d<br>
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.<br>
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,<br>
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,<br>
And will maintain what thou hast said is false<br>
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base<br>
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Excepting one, I would he were the best<br>
In all this presence that hath moved me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">If that thy valour stand on sympathy,<br>
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:<br>
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand&#8217;st,<br>
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it<br>
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester&#8217;s death.<br>
If thou deny&#8217;st it twenty times, thou liest;<br>
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,<br>
Where it was forged, with my rapier&#8217;s point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Thou darest not, coward, live to see that
day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Fitzwater, thou art damn&#8217;d to hell for
this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true<br>
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;<br>
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,<br>
To prove it on thee to the extremest point<br>
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">An if I do not, may my hands rot off<br>
And never brandish more revengeful steel<br>
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I task the earth to the like, forsworn
Aumerle;<br>
And spur thee on with full as many lies<br>
As may be holloa&#8217;d in thy treacherous ear<br>
From sun to sun: there is my honour&#8217;s pawn;<br>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Who sets me else? by heaven, I&#8217;ll throw at
all:<br>
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,<br>
To answer twenty thousand such as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well<br>
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true: you were in presence
then;<br>
And you can witness with me this is true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">Surrey, thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Dishonourable boy!<br>
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,<br>
That it shall render vengeance and revenge<br>
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie<br>
In earth as quiet as thy father&#8217;s skull:<br>
In proof whereof, there is my honour&#8217;s pawn;<br>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!<br>
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,<br>
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,<br>
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,<br>
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,<br>
To tie thee to my strong correction.<br>
As I intend to thrive in this new world,<br>
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:<br>
Besides, I heard the banish&#8217;d Norfolk say<br>
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men<br>
To execute the noble duke at Calais.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Some honest Christian trust me with a gage<br>
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,<br>
If he may be repeal&#8217;d, to try his honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">These differences shall all rest under gage<br>
Till Norfolk be repeal&#8217;d: repeal&#8217;d he shall be,<br>
And, though mine enemy, restored again<br>
To all his lands and signories: when he&#8217;s return&#8217;d,<br>
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">That honourable day shall ne&#8217;er be
seen.<br>
Many a time hath banish&#8217;d Norfolk fought<br>
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,<br>
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross<br>
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:<br>
And toil&#8217;d with works of war, retired himself<br>
To Italy; and there at Venice gave<br>
His body to that pleasant country&#8217;s earth,<br>
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,<br>
Under whose colours he had fought so long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">As surely as I live, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the
bosom<br>
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,<br>
Your differences shall all rest under gage<br>
Till we assign you to your days of trial.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of York,

<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee<br>
From plume-pluck&#8217;d Richard; who with willing soul<br>
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields<br>
To the possession of thy royal hand:<br>
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;<br>
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, I&#8217;ll ascend the regal
throne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">Marry. God forbid!<br>
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,<br>
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.<br>
Would God that any in this noble presence<br>
Were enough noble to be upright judge<br>
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would<br>
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.<br>
What subject can give sentence on his king?<br>
And who sits here that is not Richard&#8217;s subject?<br>
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,<br>
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;<br>
And shall the figure of God&#8217;s majesty,<br>
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,<br>
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,<br>
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,<br>
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,<br>
That in a Christian climate souls refined<br>
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!<br>
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,<br>
Stirr&#8217;d up by God, thus boldly for his king:<br>
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,<br>
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford&#8217;s king:<br>
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:<br>
The blood of English shall manure the ground,<br>
And future ages groan for this foul act;<br>
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,<br>
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars<br>
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;<br>
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny<br>
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call&#8217;d<br>
The field of Golgotha and dead men&#8217;s skulls.<br>
O, if you raise this house against this house,<br>
It will the woefullest division prove<br>
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.<br>
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,<br>
Lest child, child&#8217;s children, cry against you woe!</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Well have you argued, sir; and, for your
pains,<br>
Of capital treason we arrest you here.<br>
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge<br>
To keep him safely till his day of trial.<br>
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons&#8217; suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch hither Richard, that in common view<br>
He may surrender; so we shall proceed<br>
Without suspicion.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, why am I sent for to a king,<br>
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts<br>
Wherewith I reign&#8217;d? I hardly yet have learn&#8217;d<br>
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:<br>
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me<br>
To this submission. Yet I well remember<br>
The favours of these men: were they not mine?<br>
Did they not sometime cry, &#8216;all hail!&#8217; to me?<br>
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,<br>
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.<br>
God save the king! Will no man say amen?<br>
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.<br>
God save the king! although I be not he;<br>
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.<br>
To do what service am I sent for hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">To do that office of thine own good will<br>
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,<br>
The resignation of thy state and crown<br>
To Henry Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the
crown;<br>
Here cousin:<br>
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.<br>
Now is this golden crown like a deep well<br>
That owes two buckets, filling one another,<br>
The emptier ever dancing in the air,<br>
The other down, unseen and full of water:<br>
That bucket down and full of tears am I,<br>
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I thought you had been willing to resign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:<br>
You may my glories and my state depose,<br>
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Part of your cares you give me with your
crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.<br>
My care is loss of care, by old care done;<br>
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:<br>
The cares I give I have, though given away;<br>
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Are you contented to resign the crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;<br>
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.<br>
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;<br>
I give this heavy weight from off my head<br>
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,<br>
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;<br>
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,<br>
With mine own hands I give away my crown,<br>
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,<br>
With mine own breath release all duty&#8217;s rites:<br>
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;<br>
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;<br>
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:<br>
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!<br>
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!<br>
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,<br>
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!<br>
Long mayst thou live in Richard&#8217;s seat to sit,<br>
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!<br>
God save King Harry, unking&#8217;d Richard says,<br>
And send him many years of sunshine days!<br>
What more remains?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No more, but that you read<br>
These accusations and these grievous crimes<br>
Committed by your person and your followers<br>
Against the state and profit of this land;<br>
That, by confessing them, the souls of men<br>
May deem that you are worthily deposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Must I do so? and must I ravel out<br>
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,<br>
If thy offences were upon record,<br>
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop<br>
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,<br>
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,<br>
Containing the deposing of a king<br>
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,<br>
Mark&#8217;d with a blot, damn&#8217;d in the book of heaven:<br>
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,<br>
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,<br>
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands<br>
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates<br>
Have here deliver&#8217;d me to my sour cross,<br>
And water cannot wash away your sin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:<br>
And yet salt water blinds them not so much<br>
But they can see a sort of traitors here.<br>
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,<br>
I find myself a traitor with the rest;<br>
For I have given here my soul&#8217;s consent<br>
To undeck the pompous body of a king;<br>
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,<br>
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,<br>
Nor no man&#8217;s lord; I have no name, no title,<br>
No, not that name was given me at the font,<br>
But &#8217;tis usurp&#8217;d: alack the heavy day,<br>
That I have worn so many winters out,<br>
And know not now what name to call myself!<br>
O that I were a mockery king of snow,<br>
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,<br>
To melt myself away in water-drops!<br>
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,<br>
An if my word be sterling yet in England,<br>
Let it command a mirror hither straight,<br>
That it may show me what a face I have,<br>
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">They shall be satisfied: I&#8217;ll read

Where all my sins are writ, and that&#8217;s myself.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendant, with a
glass</span></p>
<p class="speech">Give me the glass, and therein will I read.<br>
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck<br>
So many blows upon this face of mine,<br>
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,<br>
Like to my followers in prosperity,<br>
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face<br>
That every day under his household roof<br>
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face<br>
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?<br>
Was this the face that faced so many follies,<br>
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?<br>
A brittle glory shineth in this face:<br>
As brittle as the glory is the face;</p>

destroy&#8217;d<br>
The shadow or your face.</p>

<p class="speech">Say that again.<br>
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let&#8217;s see:<br>
&#8217;Tis very true, my grief lies all within;<br>
And these external manners of laments<br>
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief<br>
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;<br>
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,<br>
For thy great bounty, that not only givest<br>
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way<br>
How to lament the cause. I&#8217;ll beg one boon,<br>
And then be gone and trouble you no more.<br>
Shall I obtain it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Name it, fair cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Fair cousin&#8217;? I am greater than a

For when I was a king, my flatterers<br>
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,<br>
I have a king here to my flatterer.<br>
Being so great, I have no need to beg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>

Though he divide the realm and give thee half,<br>
It is too little, helping him to all;<br>
And he shall think that thou, which know&#8217;st the way<br>
To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,<br>
Being ne&#8217;er so little urged, another way<br>
To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.<br>
The love of wicked men converts to fear;<br>
That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both<br>
To worthy danger and deserved death.</p>

A twofold marriage, &#8217;twixt my crown and me,<br>

And yet not so, for with a kiss &#8217;twas made.<br>
Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,<br>
Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;<br>
My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,<br>
She came adorned hither like sweet May,<br>
Sent back like Hallowmas or short&#8217;st of day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>
<p class="speech">And must we be divided? must we part?</p>

Better far off than near, be ne&#8217;er the near.<br>
Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen</p>

<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Twice for one step I&#8217;ll groan, the way
being short,<br>
And piece the way out with a heavy heart.<br>
Come, come, in wooing sorrow let&#8217;s be brief,<br>
Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;<br>
One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;<br>
Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.</p>

To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.<br>
So, now I have mine own again, be gone,<br>
That I might strive to kill it with a groan.</p>

When weeping made you break the story off,<br>
Of our two cousins coming into London.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Where did I leave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At that sad stop, my lord,<br>

Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,<br>
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed<br>
Which his aspiring rider seem&#8217;d to know,<br>
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,<br>
Whilst all tongues cried &#8216;God save thee,<br>
Bolingbroke!&#8217;<br>
You would have thought the very windows spake,<br>
So many greedy looks of young and old<br>
Through casements darted their desiring eyes<br>
Upon his visage, and that all the walls<br>
With painted imagery had said at once<br>
&#8216;Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!&#8217;<br>
Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,<br>
Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed&#8217;s neck,<br>
Bespake them thus: &#8216;I thank you, countrymen:&#8217;<br>
And thus still doing, thus he pass&#8217;d along.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the

<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">As in a theatre, the eyes of men,<br>
After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,<br>
Are idly bent on him that enters next,<br>
Thinking his prattle to be tedious;<br>
Even so, or with much more contempt, men&#8217;s eyes<br>
Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried &#8216;God save
him!&#8217;<br>
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:<br>
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:<br>
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,<br>
His face still combating with tears and smiles,<br>
The badges of his grief and patience,<br>
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel&#8217;d<br>
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted<br>
And barbarism itself have pitied him.<br>
But heaven hath a hand in these events,<br>
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.<br>
To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,<br>
Whose state and honour I for aye allow.</p>

I fear, I fear,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What should you fear?<br>

For gay apparel &#8217;gainst the triumph day.</p>

Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?<br>
Have we more sons? or are we like to have?<br>
Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?<br>
And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,<br>

Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Thou fond mad woman,<br>
Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?<br>
A dozen of them here have ta&#8217;en the sacrament,<br>

<p class="speech">He shall be none;<br>

As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.<br>
But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect<br>
That I have been disloyal to thy bed,<br>
And that he is a bastard, not thy son:<br>
Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:<br>
He is as like thee as a man may be,<br>
Not like to me, or any of my kin,<br>
And yet I love him.</p>

<h4>Scene V. Pomfret castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">I have been studying how I may compare<br>
This prison where I live unto the world:<br>
And for because the world is populous<br>
And here is not a creature but myself,<br>
I cannot do it; yet I&#8217;ll hammer it out.<br>
My brain I&#8217;ll prove the female to my soul,<br>
My soul the father; and these two beget<br>
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,<br>
And these same thoughts people this little world,<br>
In humours like the people of this world,<br>
For no thought is contented. The better sort,<br>
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix&#8217;d<br>
With scruples and do set the word itself<br>
Against the word:<br>
As thus, &#8216;Come, little ones,&#8217; and then again,<br>
&#8216;It is as hard to come as for a camel<br>
To thread the postern of a small needle&#8217;s eye.&#8217;<br>
Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot<br>
Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails<br>
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs<br>
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,<br>
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.<br>
Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves<br>
That they are not the first of fortune&#8217;s slaves,<br>
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars<br>
Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,<br>
That many have and others must sit there;<br>
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,<br>
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back<br>
Of such as have before endured the like.<br>
Thus play I in one person many people,<br>
And none contented: sometimes am I king;<br>
Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,<br>
And so I am: then crushing penury<br>
Persuades me I was better when a king;<br>
Then am I king&#8217;d again: and by and by<br>
Think that I am unking&#8217;d by Bolingbroke,<br>
And straight am nothing: but whate&#8217;er I be,<br>
Nor I nor any man that but man is<br>
With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased<br>
With being nothing. Music do I hear?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,<br>
When time is broke and no proportion kept!<br>
So is it in the music of men&#8217;s lives.<br>
And here have I the daintiness of ear<br>
To cheque time broke in a disorder&#8217;d string;<br>
But for the concord of my state and time<br>
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.<br>
I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;<br>
For now hath time made me his numbering clock:<br>
My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar<br>
Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,<br>
Whereto my finger, like a dial&#8217;s point,<br>
Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.<br>
Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is<br>
Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,<br>
Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans<br>
Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time<br>
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke&#8217;s proud joy,<br>
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o&#8217; the clock.<br>
This music mads me; let it sound no more;<br>
For though it have holp madmen to their wits,<br>
In me it seems it will make wise men mad.<br>
Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!<br>
For &#8217;tis a sign of love; and love to Richard<br>
Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Groom of the
Stable</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, royal prince!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, noble peer;<br>
The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.<br>
What art thou? and how comest thou hither,<br>
Where no man never comes but that sad dog<br>
That brings me food to make misfortune live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,<br>
When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,<br>
With much ado at length have gotten leave<br>
To look upon my sometimes royal master&#8217;s face.<br>
O, how it yearn&#8217;d my heart when I beheld<br>
In London streets, that coronation-day,<br>
When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,<br>
That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,<br>
That horse that I so carefully have dress&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,<br>
How went he under him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">So proudly as if he disdain&#8217;d the
ground.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!<br>
That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;<br>
This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.<br>
Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,<br>
Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck<br>
Of that proud man that did usurp his back?<br>
Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,<br>
Since thou, created to be awed by man,<br>
Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;<br>
And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,<br>
Spurr&#8217;d, gall&#8217;d and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Keeper, with a
dish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">If thou love me, &#8217;tis time thou wert
away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Groom</p>
<p class="speech">What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall
say.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, will&#8217;t please you to fall to?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
lately came from the king, commands the contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!<br>
Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats the keeper</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Help, help, help!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Exton and Servants,
armed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what means death in this rude
assault?<br>
Villain, thy own hand yields thy death&#8217;s instrument.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Snatching an axe from a
Servant and killing him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go thou, and fill another room in hell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He kills another. Then Exton
strikes him down</span></p>
<p class="speech">That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire<br>
That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand<br>
Hath with the king&#8217;s blood stain&#8217;d the king&#8217;s own
land.<br>
Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;<br>
Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exton</p>
<p class="speech">As full of valour as of royal blood:<br>
Both have I spill&#8217;d; O would the deed were good!<br>
For now the devil, that told me I did well,<br>
Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.<br>
This dead king to the living king I&#8217;ll bear<br>
Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</p>

<h4>Scene Vi. Windsor castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter Henry
Bolingbroke, Duke Of York, with other Lords, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear<br>
Is that the rebels have consumed with fire<br>
Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;<br>
But whether they be ta&#8217;en or slain we hear not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter
Northumberland</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lord what is the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">First, to thy sacred state wish I all
happiness.<br>
The next news is, I have to London sent<br>
The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:<br>
The manner of their taking may appear<br>
At large discoursed in this paper here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;<br>
And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lord
Fitzwater</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London<br>
The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,<br>
Two of the dangerous consorted traitors<br>
That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;<br>
Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Percy, and the
Bishop Of Carlisle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,<br>
With clog of conscience and sour melancholy<br>
Hath yielded up his body to the grave;<br>
But here is Carlisle living, to abide<br>
Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Carlisle, this is your doom:<br>
Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,<br>
More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;<br>
So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:<br>
For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,<br>
High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Exton, with persons
bearing a coffin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exton</p>
<p class="speech">Great king, within this coffin I present<br>
Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies<br>
The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,<br>
Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast
wrought<br>
A deed of slander with thy fatal hand<br>
Upon my head and all this famous land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exton</p>
<p class="speech">From your own mouth, my lord, did I this
deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">They love not poison that do poison need,<br>
Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,<br>
I hate the murderer, love him murdered.<br>
The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,<br>
But neither my good word nor princely favour:<br>
With Cain go wander through shades of night,<br>
And never show thy head by day nor light.<br>
Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,<br>
That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:<br>
Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,<br>
And put on sullen black incontinent:<br>
I&#8217;ll make a voyage to the Holy Land,<br>
To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:<br>
March sadly after; grace my mournings here;<br>
In weeping after this untimely bier.</p>
