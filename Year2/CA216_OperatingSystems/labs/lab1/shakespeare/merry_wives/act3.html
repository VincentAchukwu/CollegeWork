Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student
from his book, and it is wonderful.</p>

<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who,
belike
having received wrong by some person, is at most

had as
lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.</p>

<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and
Galen,
&#8212;and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you
would desires to be acquainted withal.</p>

Welsh,
soul-curer and body-curer!</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, dat is very good; excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am
I
politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are
whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay
their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;
follow, follow, follow.</p>

Robin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont
to
be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master&#8217;s
heels?</p>
<p class="speaker">Robin</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a
man
than follow him like a dwarf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">O, you are a flattering boy: now I see
you&#8217;ll be a courtier.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for
want
of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
you two would marry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Be sure of that,&#8212;two other husbands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Where had you this pretty weather-cock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
husband had him of. What do you call your knight&#8217;s
name, sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Robin</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Sir John Falstaff!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">He, he; I can never hit on&#8217;s name. There is
such a
league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
home indeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed she is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mistress Page and
Robin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he
any
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
score. He pieces out his wife&#8217;s inclination; he
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she&#8217;s
going to my wife, and Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her. A
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
Falstaff&#8217;s boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
and our revolted wives share damnation together.
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
my neighbours shall cry aim.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clock heard</span></p>
<p class="speech">The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids
me
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
there: I will go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Page, Shallow, Slender,
Host, Sir Hugh Evans, Doctor Caius, and Rugby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow, Page, amp;c</p>
<p class="speech">Well met, Master Ford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at
home;
and I pray you all go with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">I must excuse myself, Master Ford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine
with
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
more money than I&#8217;ll speak of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">We have lingered about a match between Anne Page
and
my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Slender</p>
<p class="speech">I hope I have your good will, father Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for
you:
but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor Caius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my
nursh-a<br>
Quickly tell me so mush.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers,
he
dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
carry&#8217;t, he will carry&#8217;t; &#8217;tis in his buttons;
he
will carry&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman
is
of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with
me
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer
wooing
at Master Page&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Shallow, and
Slender</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest
knight<br>
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.</p>

be
ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.</p>

us?</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, I&#8217;ll be sworn. My master knows not of
your

everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
swears he&#8217;ll turn me away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Thou&#8217;rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now
let
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">O sweet Sir John!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
thy husband were dead: I&#8217;ll speak it before the
best lord; I would make thee my lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a
pitiful lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Let the court of France show me such another. I
see
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
Venetian admittance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become
nothing
else; nor that well neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so:
thou
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, there is no such thing in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What made me love thee? let that persuade
thee
there&#8217;s something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
women in men&#8217;s apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
but thee; and thou deservest it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress
Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by
the
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
of a lime-kiln.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall
one
day find it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

<p class="speech">What cause of suspicion?</p>

<p class="speech">What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am
I

<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, alas, what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Your husband&#8217;s coming hither, woman, with
all the
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.</p>

here! but &#8217;tis most certain your husband&#8217;s coming,
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
one. I come before to tell you. If you know
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were

<p class="speech">For shame! never stand &#8216;you had
rather&#8217; and &#8216;you

you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
if it were going to bucking: or&#8212;it is whiting-time
&#8212;send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>

husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual

encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
forsooth, to search his house for his wife&#8217;s love.</p>

<p class="speech">What, while you were there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">While I was there.</p>

you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>

comes
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford&#8217;s
approach; and, in her invention and Ford&#8217;s wife&#8217;s
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</p>

<p class="speech">A buck-basket!</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with
foul
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">And how long lay you there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I
have
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford&#8217;s
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
the jealous knave their master in the door, who
asked them once or twice what they had in their
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,&#8212;a
man of my kidney,&#8212;think of that,&#8212;that am as subject
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that,&#8212;hissing hot,&#8212;think of that, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake
you
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
you&#8217;ll undertake her no more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I
have
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
received from her another embassy of meeting; &#8217;twixt
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis past eight already, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Is it? I will then address me to my
appointment.
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
cuckold Ford.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do
I
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
there&#8217;s a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
This &#8217;tis to be married! this &#8217;tis to have linen
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
house; he cannot &#8217;scape me; &#8217;tis impossible he
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
guides him should aid him, I will search
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
with me: I&#8217;ll be horn-mad.</p>
