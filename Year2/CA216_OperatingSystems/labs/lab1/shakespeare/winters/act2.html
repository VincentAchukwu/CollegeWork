<h4>Scene I. A room in Leontes&#8217; palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hermione, Mamillius,
and Ladies</span></p>
<p id="bm124" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm124">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,<br>
&#8217;Tis past enduring.</p>
<p id="bm125" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm125">First Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come, my gracious lord,<br>
Shall I be your playfellow?</p>
<p id="bm126" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm126">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll none of you.</p>
<p id="bm127" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm127">First Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, my sweet lord?</p>
<p id="bm128" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm128">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll kiss me hard and speak to me as
if<br>
I were a baby still. I love you better.</p>
<p id="bm129" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm129">Second Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">And why so, my lord?</p>
<p id="bm130" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm130">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not for because<br>
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,<br>
Become some women best, so that there be not<br>
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle<br>
Or a half-moon made with a pen.</p>
<p id="bm131" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm131">Second Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who taught you this?</p>
<p id="bm132" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm132">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">I learnt it out of women&#8217;s faces. Pray
now<br>
What colour are your eyebrows?</p>
<p id="bm133" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm133">First Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">Blue, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm134" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm134">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s a mock: I have seen a
lady&#8217;s nose<br>
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</p>
<p id="bm135" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm135">First Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">Hark ye;<br>
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall<br>
Present our services to a fine new prince<br>
One of these days; and then you&#8217;ld wanton with us,<br>
If we would have you.</p>
<p id="bm136" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm136">Second Lady</a></p>
<p class="speech">She is spread of late<br>
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!</p>
<p id="bm137" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm137">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now<br>
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,<br>
And tell &#8217;s a tale.</p>
<p id="bm138" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm138">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">Merry or sad shall&#8217;t be?</p>
<p id="bm139" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm139">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">As merry as you will.</p>
<p id="bm140" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm140">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">A sad tale&#8217;s best for winter: I have
one<br>
Of sprites and goblins.</p>
<p id="bm141" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm141">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s have that, good sir.<br>
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best<br>
To fright me with your sprites; you&#8217;re powerful at it.</p>
<p id="bm142" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm142">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">There was a man&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm143" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm143">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, come, sit down; then on.</p>
<p id="bm144" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm144">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;<br>
Yond crickets shall not hear it.</p>
<p id="bm145" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm145">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come on, then,<br>
And give&#8217;t me in mine ear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Leontes, with
Antigonus, Lords and others</span></p>
<p id="bm146" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm146">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Was he met there? his train? Camillo with
him?</p>
<p id="bm147" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm147">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never<br>
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them<br>
Even to their ships.</p>
<p id="bm148" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm148">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How blest am I<br>
In my just censure, in my true opinion!<br>
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed<br>
In being so blest! There may be in the cup<br>
A spider steep&#8217;d, and one may drink, depart,<br>
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge<br>
Is not infected: but if one present<br>
The abhorr&#8217;d ingredient to his eye, make known<br>
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,<br>
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.<br>
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:<br>
There is a plot against my life, my crown;<br>
All&#8217;s true that is mistrusted: that false villain<br>
Whom I employ&#8217;d was pre-employ&#8217;d by him:<br>
He has discover&#8217;d my design, and I<br>
Remain a pinch&#8217;d thing; yea, a very trick<br>
For them to play at will. How came the posterns<br>
So easily open?</p>
<p id="bm149" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm149">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By his great authority;<br>
Which often hath no less prevail&#8217;d than so<br>
On your command.</p>
<p id="bm150" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm150">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I know&#8217;t too well.<br>
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:<br>
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you<br>
Have too much blood in him.</p>
<p id="bm151" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm151">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">What is this? sport?</p>
<p id="bm152" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm152">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about
her;<br>
Away with him! and let her sport herself<br>
With that she&#8217;s big with; for &#8217;tis Polixenes<br>
Has made thee swell thus.</p>
<p id="bm153" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm153">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">But I&#8217;ld say he had not,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be sworn you would believe my saying,<br>
Howe&#8217;er you lean to the nayward.</p>
<p id="bm154" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm154">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">You, my lords,<br>
Look on her, mark her well; be but about<br>
To say &#8216;she is a goodly lady,&#8217; and<br>
The justice of your bearts will thereto add<br>
&#8217;Tis pity she&#8217;s not honest, honourable:&#8217;<br>
Praise her but for this her without-door form,<br>
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight<br>
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands<br>
That calumny doth use&#8212;O, I am out&#8212;<br>
That mercy does, for calumny will sear<br>
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha&#8217;s,<br>
When you have said &#8216;she&#8217;s goodly,&#8217; come
between<br>
Ere you can say &#8216;she&#8217;s honest:&#8217; but be &#8217;t
known,<br>
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,<br>
She&#8217;s an adulteress.</p>
<p id="bm155" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm155">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Should a villain say so,<br>
The most replenish&#8217;d villain in the world,<br>
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,<br>
Do but mistake.</p>
<p id="bm156" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm156">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You have mistook, my lady,<br>
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!<br>
Which I&#8217;ll not call a creature of thy place,<br>
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,<br>
Should a like language use to all degrees<br>
And mannerly distinguishment leave out<br>
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said<br>
She&#8217;s an adulteress; I have said with whom:<br>
More, she&#8217;s a traitor and Camillo is<br>
A federary with her, and one that knows<br>
What she should shame to know herself<br>
But with her most vile principal, that she&#8217;s<br>
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those<br>
That vulgars give bold&#8217;st titles, ay, and privy<br>
To this their late escape.</p>
<p id="bm157" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm157">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, by my life.<br>
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,<br>
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<br>
You thus have publish&#8217;d me! Gentle my lord,<br>
You scarce can right me throughly then to say<br>
You did mistake.</p>
<p id="bm158" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm158">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No; if I mistake<br>
In those foundations which I build upon,<br>
The centre is not big enough to bear<br>
A school-boy&#8217;s top. Away with her! to prison!<br>
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty<br>
But that he speaks.</p>
<p id="bm159" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm159">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s some ill planet reigns:<br>
I must be patient till the heavens look<br>
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,<br>
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<br>
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew<br>
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have<br>
That honourable grief lodged here which burns<br>
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,<br>
With thoughts so qualified as your charities<br>
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>
The king&#8217;s will be perform&#8217;d!</p>
<p id="bm160" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm160">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Shall I be heard?</p>
<p id="bm161" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm161">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who is&#8217;t that goes with me? Beseech your
highness,<br>
My women may be with me; for you see<br>
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;<br>
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress<br>
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<br>
As I come out: this action I now go on<br>
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:<br>
I never wish&#8217;d to see you sorry; now<br>
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.</p>
<p id="bm162" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm162">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Go, do our bidding; hence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hermione, guarded; with
Ladies</span></p>
<p id="bm163" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm163">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech your highness, call the queen again.</p>
<p id="bm164" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm164">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Be certain what you do, sir, lest your
justice<br>
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,<br>
Yourself, your queen, your son.</p>
<p id="bm165" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm165">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">For her, my lord,<br>
I dare my life lay down and will do&#8217;t, sir,<br>
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless<br>
I&#8217; the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,<br>
In this which you accuse her.</p>
<p id="bm166" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm166">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If it prove<br>
She&#8217;s otherwise, I&#8217;ll keep my stables where<br>
I lodge my wife; I&#8217;ll go in couples with her;<br>
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;<br>
For every inch of woman in the world,<br>
Ay, every dram of woman&#8217;s flesh is false, If she be.</p>
<p id="bm167" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm167">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Hold your peaces.</p>
<p id="bm168" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm168">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm169" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm169">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:<br>
You are abused and by some putter-on<br>
That will be damn&#8217;d for&#8217;t; would I knew the
villain,<br>
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw&#8217;d,<br>
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven<br>
The second and the third, nine, and some five;<br>
If this prove true, they&#8217;ll pay for&#8217;t:
by mine honour,<br>
I&#8217;ll geld &#8217;em all; fourteen they shall not see,<br>
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;<br>
And I had rather glib myself than they<br>
Should not produce fair issue.</p>
<p id="bm170" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm170">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Cease; no more.<br>
You smell this business with a sense as cold<br>
As is a dead man&#8217;s nose: but I do see&#8217;t and
feel&#8217;t<br>
As you feel doing thus; and see withal<br>
The instruments that feel.</p>
<p id="bm171" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm171">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If it be so,<br>
We need no grave to bury honesty:<br>
There&#8217;s not a grain of it the face to sweeten<br>
Of the whole dungy earth.</p>
<p id="bm172" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm172">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What! lack I credit?</p>
<p id="bm173" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm173">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,<br>
Upon this ground; and more it would content me<br>
To have her honour true than your suspicion,<br>
Be blamed for&#8217;t how you might.</p>
<p id="bm174" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm174">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, what need we<br>
Commune with you of this, but rather follow<br>
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative<br>
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness<br>
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied<br>
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not<br>
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves<br>
We need no more of your advice: the matter,<br>
The loss, the gain, the ordering on&#8217;t, is all<br>
Properly ours.</p>
<p id="bm175" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm175">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And I wish, my liege,<br>
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,<br>
Without more overture.</p>
<p id="bm176" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm176">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How could that be?<br>
Either thou art most ignorant by age,<br>
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo&#8217;s flight,<br>
Added to their familiarity,<br>
Which was as gross as ever touch&#8217;d conjecture,<br>
That lack&#8217;d sight only, nought for approbation<br>
But only seeing, all other circumstances<br>
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:<br>
Yet, for a greater confirmation,<br>
For in an act of this importance &#8217;twere<br>
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch&#8217;d in post<br>
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo&#8217;s temple,<br>
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know<br>
Of stuff&#8217;d sufficiency: now from the oracle<br>
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,<br>
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</p>
<p id="bm177" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm177">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Well done, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm178" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm178">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Though I am satisfied and need no more<br>
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle<br>
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he<br>
Whose ignorant credulity will not<br>
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good<br>
From our free person she should be confined,<br>
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence<br>
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;<br>
We are to speak in public; for this business<br>
Will raise us all.</p>
<p id="bm179" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm179">Antigonus</a></p>

The silence often of pure innocence<br>
Persuades when speaking fails.</p>
<p id="bm193" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm193">Emilia</a></p>
<p class="speech">Most worthy madam,<br>
Your honour and your goodness is so evident<br>
That your free undertaking cannot miss<br>
A thriving issue: there is no lady living<br>
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship<br>
To visit the next room, I&#8217;ll presently<br>
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;<br>
Who but to-day hammer&#8217;d of this design,<br>
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,<br>
Lest she should be denied.</p>
<p id="bm194" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm194">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Tell her, Emilia.<br>
I&#8217;ll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from&#8217;t<br>
As boldness from my bosom, let &#8217;t not be doubted<br>
I shall do good.</p>
<p id="bm195" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm195">Emilia</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now be you blest for it!
I&#8217;ll to the queen: please you,
come something nearer.</p>
<p id="bm196" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm196">Gaoler</a></p>
<p class="speech">Madam, if&#8217;t please the queen to send the
babe,<br>
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,<br>
Having no warrant.</p>
<p id="bm197" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm197">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You need not fear it, sir:<br>
This child was prisoner to the womb and is<br>
By law and process of great nature thence<br>
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to<br>
The anger of the king nor guilty of,<br>
If any be, the trespass of the queen.</p>
<p id="bm198" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm198">Gaoler</a></p>
<p class="speech">I do believe it.</p>
<p id="bm199" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm199">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do not you fear: upon mine
honour,<br>
I will stand betwixt you and danger.</p>

Lords, and Servants</span></p>
<p id="bm200" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm200">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness<br>
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If<br>
The cause were not in being,&#8212;part o&#8217; the cause,<br>
She the adulteress; for the harlot king<br>
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank<br>
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she<br>
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,<br>
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest<br>
Might come to me again. Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p id="bm201" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm201">First Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord?</p>
<p id="bm202" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm202">Leontes</a></p>

<p id="bm203" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm203">First Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He took good rest to-night;<br>
&#8217;Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.</p>
<p id="bm204" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm204">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">To see his nobleness!<br>
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,<br>
He straight declined, droop&#8217;d, took it deeply,<br>
Fasten&#8217;d and fix&#8217;d the shame on&#8217;t in himself,<br>
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,<br>
And downright languish&#8217;d. Leave me solely: go,<br>
See how he fares.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie! no thought of him:<br>
The thought of my revenges that way<br>
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,<br>
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be<br>
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,<br>
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes<br>
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:<br>
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor<br>
Shall she within my power.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Paulina, with a
child</span></p>
<p id="bm205" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm205">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">You must not enter.</p>
<p id="bm206" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm206">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:<br>
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,<br>
Than the queen&#8217;s life? a gracious innocent soul,<br>
More free than he is jealous.</p>
<p id="bm207" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm207">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s enough.</p>
<p id="bm208" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm208">Second Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded<br>
None should come at him.</p>
<p id="bm209" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm209">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not so hot, good sir:<br>
I come to bring him sleep. &#8217;Tis such as you,<br>
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh<br>
At each his needless heavings, such as you<br>
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I<br>
Do come with words as medicinal as true,<br>
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour<br>
That presses him from sleep.</p>
<p id="bm210" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm210">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What noise there, ho?</p>
<p id="bm211" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm211">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">No noise, my lord; but needful conference<br>
About some gossips for your highness.</p>
<p id="bm212" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm212">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How!<br>
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,<br>
I charged thee that she should not come about me:<br>
I knew she would.</p>
<p id="bm213" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm213">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I told her so, my lord,<br>
On your displeasure&#8217;s peril and on mine,<br>
She should not visit you.</p>
<p id="bm214" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm214">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, canst not rule her?</p>
<p id="bm215" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm215">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">From all dishonesty he can: in this,<br>
Unless he take the course that you have done,<br>
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,<br>
He shall not rule me.</p>
<p id="bm216" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm216">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">La you now, you hear:<br>
When she will take the rein I let her run;<br>
But she&#8217;ll not stumble.</p>
<p id="bm217" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm217">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my liege, I come;<br>
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess<br>
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,<br>
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare<br>
Less appear so in comforting your evils,<br>
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come<br>
From your good queen.</p>
<p id="bm218" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm218">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good queen!</p>
<p id="bm219" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm219">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good queen, my lord,<br>
Good queen; I say good queen;<br>
And would by combat make her good, so were I<br>
A man, the worst about you.</p>
<p id="bm220" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm220">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Force her hence.</p>
<p id="bm221" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm221">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes<br>
First hand me: on mine own accord I&#8217;ll off;<br>
But first I&#8217;ll do my errand. The good queen,<br>
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;<br>
Here &#8217;tis; commends it to your blessing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Laying down the
child</span></p>
<p id="bm222" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm222">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Out!<br>
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o&#8217; door:<br>
A most intelligencing bawd!</p>
<p id="bm223" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm223">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not so:<br>
I am as ignorant in that as you<br>
In so entitling me, and no less honest<br>
Than you are mad; which is enough, I&#8217;ll warrant,<br>
As this world goes, to pass for honest.</p>
<p id="bm224" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm224">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Traitors!<br>
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.<br>
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted<br>
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;<br>
Take&#8217;t up, I say; give&#8217;t to thy crone.</p>
<p id="bm225" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm225">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">For ever<br>
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou<br>
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness<br>
Which he has put upon&#8217;t!</p>
<p id="bm226" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm226">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">He dreads his wife.</p>
<p id="bm227" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm227">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">So I would you did; then &#8217;twere past all
doubt<br>
You&#8217;ld call your children yours.</p>
<p id="bm228" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm228">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">A nest of traitors!</p>
<p id="bm229" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm229">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am none, by this good light.</p>
<p id="bm230" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm230">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nor I, nor any<br>
But one that&#8217;s here, and that&#8217;s himself, for he<br>
The sacred honour of himself, his queen&#8217;s,<br>
His hopeful son&#8217;s, his babe&#8217;s, betrays to slander,<br>
Whose sting is sharper than the sword&#8217;s;
and will not&#8212;<br>
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse<br>
He cannot be compell&#8217;d to&#8217;t&#8212;once remove<br>
The root of his opinion, which is rotten<br>
As ever oak or stone was sound.</p>
<p id="bm231" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm231">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">A callat<br>
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband<br>
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;<br>
It is the issue of Polixenes:<br>
Hence with it, and together with the dam<br>
Commit them to the fire!</p>
<p id="bm232" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm232">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is yours;<br>
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,<br>
So like you, &#8217;tis the worse. Behold, my lords,<br>
Although the print be little, the whole matter<br>
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,<br>
The trick of&#8217;s frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,<br>
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,<br>
His smiles,<br>
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:<br>
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it<br>
So like to him that got it, if thou hast<br>
The ordering of the mind too, &#8217;mongst all colours<br>
No yellow in&#8217;t, lest she suspect, as he does,<br>
Her children not her husband&#8217;s!</p>
<p id="bm233" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm233">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">A gross hag<br>
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang&#8217;d,<br>
That wilt not stay her tongue.</p>
<p id="bm234" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm234">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Hang all the husbands<br>
That cannot do that feat, you&#8217;ll leave yourself<br>
Hardly one subject.</p>
<p id="bm235" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm235">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Once more, take her hence.</p>
<p id="bm236" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm236">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">A most unworthy and unnatural lord<br>
Can do no more.</p>
<p id="bm237" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm237">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I&#8217;ll ha&#8217; thee
burnt.</p>
<p id="bm238" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm238">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I care not:<br>
It is an heretic that makes the fire,<br>
Not she which burns in&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll not call you tyrant;<br>
But this most cruel usage of your queen,<br>
Not able to produce more accusation<br>
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours<br>
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,<br>
Yea, scandalous to the world.</p>
<p id="bm239" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm239">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">On your allegiance,<br>
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,<br>
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,<br>
If she did know me one. Away with her!</p>
<p id="bm240" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm240">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, do not push me; I&#8217;ll be
gone.<br>
Look to your babe, my lord; &#8217;tis yours:<br>
Jove send her<br>
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?<br>
You, that are thus so tender o&#8217;er his follies,<br>
Will never do him good, not one of you.<br>
So, so: farewell; we are gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p id="bm241" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm241">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.<br>
My child? away with&#8217;t! Even thou, that hast<br>
A heart so tender o&#8217;er it, take it hence<br>
And see it instantly consumed with fire;<br>
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:<br>
Within this hour bring me word &#8217;tis done,<br>
And by good testimony, or I&#8217;ll seize thy life,<br>
With what thou else call&#8217;st thine. If thou refuse<br>
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;<br>
The bastard brains with these my proper hands<br>
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;<br>
For thou set&#8217;st on thy wife.</p>
<p id="bm242" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm242">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I did not, sir:<br>
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,<br>
Can clear me in&#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm243" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm243">Lords</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We can: my royal liege,<br>
He is not guilty of her coming hither.</p>
<p id="bm244" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm244">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re liars all.</p>
<p id="bm245" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm245">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech your highness, give us better credit:<br>
We have always truly served you, and beseech you<br>
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,<br>
As recompense of our dear services<br>
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,<br>
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must<br>
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.</p>
<p id="bm246" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm246">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am a feather for each wind that blows:<br>
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel<br>
And call me father? better burn it now<br>
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.<br>
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;<br>
You that have been so tenderly officious<br>
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,<br>
To save this bastard&#8217;s life,&#8212;for &#8217;tis a
bastard,<br>
So sure as this beard&#8217;s grey,<br>
&#8212;what will you adventure<br>
To save this brat&#8217;s life?</p>
<p id="bm247" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm247">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Any thing, my lord,<br>
That my ability may undergo<br>
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:<br>
I&#8217;ll pawn the little blood which I have left<br>
To save the innocent: any thing possible.</p>
<p id="bm248" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm248">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">It shall be possible. Swear by this sword<br>
Thou wilt perform my bidding.</p>
<p id="bm249" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm249">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm250" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm250">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Mark and perform it, see&#8217;st thou! for the
fail<br>
Of any point in&#8217;t shall not only be<br>
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,<br>
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,<br>
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry<br>
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it<br>
To some remote and desert place quite out<br>
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,<br>
Without more mercy, to its own protection<br>
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune<br>
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,<br>
On thy soul&#8217;s peril and thy body&#8217;s torture,<br>
That thou commend it strangely to some place<br>
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.</p>
<p id="bm251" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm251">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I swear to do this, though a present death<br>
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:<br>
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens<br>
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say<br>
Casting their savageness aside have done<br>
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous<br>
In more than this deed does require! And blessing<br>
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,<br>
Poor thing, condemn&#8217;d to loss!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit with the
child</span></p>
<p id="bm252" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm252">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll not rear<br>
Another&#8217;s issue.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p id="bm253" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm253">Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Please your highness, posts<br>
From those you sent to the oracle are come<br>
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,<br>
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,<br>
Hasting to the court.</p>
<p id="bm254" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm254">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">So please you, sir, their speed<br>
Hath been beyond account.</p>
<p id="bm255" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm255">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Twenty-three days<br>
They have been absent: &#8217;tis good speed; foretells<br>
The great Apollo suddenly will have<br>
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;<br>
Summon a session, that we may arraign<br>
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath<br>
Been publicly accused, so shall she have<br>
A just and open trial. While she lives<br>
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,<br>
And think upon my bidding.</p>
