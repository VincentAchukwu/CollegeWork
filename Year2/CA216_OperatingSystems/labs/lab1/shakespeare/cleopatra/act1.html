<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Demetrius and
Philo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Philo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but this dotage of our general&#8217;s<br>
O&#8217;erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<br>
That o&#8217;er the files and musters of the war<br>
Have glow&#8217;d like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<br>
The office and devotion of their view<br>
Upon a tawny front: his captain&#8217;s heart,<br>
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<br>
And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
To cool a gipsy&#8217;s lust.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter Antony,
Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning
her</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look, where they come:<br>
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<br>
The triple pillar of the world transform&#8217;d<br>
Into a strumpet&#8217;s fool: behold and see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s beggary in the love that can be
reckon&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new
earth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">News, my good lord, from Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Grates me: the sum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear them, Antony:<br>
Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<br>
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
His powerful mandate to you, &#8216;Do this, or this;<br>
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<br>
Perform &#8217;t, or else we damn thee.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How, my love!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance! nay, and most like:<br>
You must not stay here longer, your dismission<br>
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<br>
Where&#8217;s Fulvia&#8217;s process? Caesar&#8217;s I would say?
both?<br>
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt&#8217;s queen,<br>
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine<br>
Is Caesar&#8217;s homager: else so thy cheek pays shame<br>
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<br>
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<br>
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike<br>
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life<br>
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Embracing</span></p>
<p class="speech">And such a twain can do&#8217;t, in which I
bind,<br>
On pain of punishment, the world to weet<br>
We stand up peerless.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent falsehood!<br>
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<br>
I&#8217;ll seem the fool I am not; Antony<br>
Will be himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But stirr&#8217;d by Cleopatra.<br>
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,<br>
Let&#8217;s not confound the time with conference harsh:<br>
There&#8217;s not a minute of our lives should stretch<br>
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Hear the ambassadors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, wrangling queen!<br>
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,<br>
To weep; whose every passion fully strives<br>
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!<br>
No messenger, but thine; and all alone<br>
To-night we&#8217;ll wander through the streets and note<br>
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;<br>
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mark Antony and
Cleopatra with their train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Philo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,<br>
He comes too short of that great property<br>
Which still should go with Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I am full sorry<br>
That he approves the common liar, who<br>
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope<br>
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. Another room.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Charmian, Iras, Alexas,
and a Soothsayer</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing
Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where&#8217;s the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Soothsayer!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the man? Is&#8217;t you, sir, that know
things?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">In nature&#8217;s infinite book of secrecy<br>
A little I can read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Show him your hand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Domitius
Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough<br>
Cleopatra&#8217;s health to drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, give me good fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">I make not, but foresee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, then, foresee me one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">He means in flesh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">No, you shall paint when you are old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Wrinkles forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Vex not his prescience; be attentive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Hush!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be more beloving than beloved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be
married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent! I love long life better than
figs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You have seen and proved a fairer former
fortune<br>
Than that which is to approach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">If every of your wishes had a womb.<br>
And fertile every wish, a million.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">You think none but your sheets are privy to your
wishes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll know all our fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night,
shall
be&#8212;drunk to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s a palm presages chastity, if
nothing else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en as the o&#8217;erflowing Nilus
presageth famine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Your fortunes are alike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">But how, but how? give me particulars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">I have said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better
than<br>
I, where would you choose it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Not in my husband&#8217;s nose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Our worser thoughts heavens mend!
Alexas,&#8212;come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the
people!
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me
a
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
they&#8217;ld do&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Hush! here comes Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Not he; the queen.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Saw you my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Was he not here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden<br>
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Seek him, and bring him hither.<br>
Where&#8217;s Alexas?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Here, at your service. My lord approaches.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">We will not look upon him: go with us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mark Antony with a
Messenger and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Against my brother Lucius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay:<br>
But soon that war had end, and the time&#8217;s state<br>
Made friends of them, joining their force &#8217;gainst Caesar;<br>
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,<br>
Upon the first encounter, drave them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what worst?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">The nature of bad news infects the teller.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">When it concerns the fool or coward. On:<br>
Things that are past are done with me. &#8217;Tis thus:<br>
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,<br>
I hear him as he flatter&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Labienus&#8212;<br>
This is stiff news&#8212;hath, with his Parthian force,<br>
Extended Asia from Euphrates;<br>
His conquering banner shook from Syria<br>
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Antony, thou wouldst say,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Speak to me home, mince not the general
tongue:<br>
Name Cleopatra as she is call&#8217;d in Rome;<br>
Rail thou in Fulvia&#8217;s phrase; and taunt my faults<br>
With such full licence as both truth and malice<br>
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,<br>
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us<br>
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">At your noble pleasure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">The man from Sicyon,&#8212;is there such an
one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">He stays upon your will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let him appear.<br>
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,<br>
Or lose myself in dotage.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter another
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech">What are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia thy wife is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Where died she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">In Sicyon:<br>
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious<br>
Importeth thee to know, this bears.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gives a letter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Second
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s a great spirit gone! Thus did I
desire it:<br>
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,<br>
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,<br>
By revolution lowering, does become<br>
The opposite of itself: she&#8217;s good, being gone;<br>
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.<br>
I must from this enchanting queen break off:<br>
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,<br>
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Domitius
Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your pleasure, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I must with haste from hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death&#8217;s the word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I must be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it
were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">She is cunning past man&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Alexas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing
but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Would I had never seen her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful
piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
out, there are members to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">The business she hath broached in the state<br>
Cannot endure my absence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">And the business you have broached here cannot
be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra&#8217;s, which
wholly depends on your abode.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">No more light answers. Let our officers<br>
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break<br>
The cause of our expedience to the queen,<br>
And get her leave to part. For not alone<br>
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,<br>
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too<br>
Of many our contriving friends in Rome<br>
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius<br>
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands<br>
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,<br>
Whose love is never link&#8217;d to the deserver<br>
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw<br>
Pompey the Great and all his dignities<br>
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,<br>
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up<br>
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,<br>
The sides o&#8217; the world may danger: much is breeding,<br>
Which, like the courser&#8217;s hair, hath yet but life,<br>
And not a serpent&#8217;s poison. Say, our pleasure,<br>
To such whose place is under us, requires<br>
Our quick remove from hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I shall do&#8217;t.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O, never was there queen<br>
So mightily betray&#8217;d! yet at the first<br>
I saw the treasons planted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Cleopatra,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Why should I think you can be mine and true,<br>
Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,<br>
Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,<br>
To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,<br>
Which break themselves in swearing!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Most sweet queen,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,<br>
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,<br>
Then was the time for words: no going then;<br>
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,<br>
Bliss in our brows&#8217; bent; none our parts so poor,<br>
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,<br>
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,<br>
Art turn&#8217;d the greatest liar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How now, lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know<br>
There were a heart in Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, queen:<br>
The strong necessity of time commands<br>
Our services awhile; but my full heart<br>
Remains in use with you. Our Italy<br>
Shines o&#8217;er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius<br>
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:<br>
Equality of two domestic powers<br>
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,<br>
Are newly grown to love: the condemn&#8217;d Pompey,<br>
Rich in his father&#8217;s honour, creeps apace,<br>
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived<br>
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;<br>
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge<br>
By any desperate change: my more particular,<br>
And that which most with you should safe my going,<br>
Is Fulvia&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Though age from folly could not give me
freedom,<br>
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s dead, my queen:<br>
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read<br>
The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:<br>
See when and where she died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O most false love!<br>
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill<br>
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,<br>
In Fulvia&#8217;s death, how mine received shall be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know<br>
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,<br>
As you shall give the advice. By the fire<br>
That quickens Nilus&#8217; slime, I go from hence<br>
Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war<br>
As thou affect&#8217;st.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Cut my lace, Charmian, come;<br>
But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,<br>
So Antony loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My precious queen, forbear;<br>
And give true evidence to his love, which stands<br>
An honourable trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">So Fulvia told me.<br>
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,<br>
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears<br>
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene<br>
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look<br>
Life perfect honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll heat my blood: no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">You can do better yet; but this is meetly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my sword,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">And target. Still he mends;<br>
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,<br>
How this Herculean Roman does become<br>
The carriage of his chafe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll leave you, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Courteous lord, one word.<br>
Sir, you and I must part, but that&#8217;s not it:<br>
Sir, you and I have loved, but there&#8217;s not it;<br>
That you know well: something it is I would,<br>
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,<br>
And I am all forgotten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">But that your royalty<br>
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you<br>
For idleness itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis sweating labour<br>
To bear such idleness so near the heart<br>
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;<br>
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not<br>
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;<br>
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.<br>
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword<br>
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success<br>
Be strew&#8217;d before your feet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let us go. Come;<br>
Our separation so abides, and flies,<br>
That thou, residing here, go&#8217;st yet with me,<br>
And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!</p>

<h4>Scene IV. Rome. Octavius Caesar&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Octavius Caesar,
reading a letter, Lepidus, and their Train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,<br>
It is not Caesar&#8217;s natural vice to hate<br>
Our great competitor: from Alexandria<br>
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes<br>
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like<br>
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy<br>
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or<br>
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there<br>
A man who is the abstract of all faults<br>
That all men follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">I must not think there are<br>
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:<br>
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,<br>
More fiery by night&#8217;s blackness; hereditary,<br>
Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,<br>
Than what he chooses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is
not<br>
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;<br>
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit<br>
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;<br>
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet<br>
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
becomes him,&#8212;<br>
As his composure must be rare indeed<br>
Whom these things cannot blemish,&#8212;yet must Antony<br>
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear<br>
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill&#8217;d<br>
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,<br>
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,<br>
Call on him for&#8217;t: but to confound such time,<br>
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud<br>
As his own state and ours,&#8212;&#8217;tis to be chid<br>
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,<br>
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,<br>
And so rebel to judgment.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s more news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,<br>
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report<br>
How &#8217;tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;<br>
And it appears he is beloved of those<br>
That only have fear&#8217;d Caesar: to the ports<br>
The discontents repair, and men&#8217;s reports<br>
Give him much wrong&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I should have known no less.<br>
It hath been taught us from the primal state,<br>
That he which is was wish&#8217;d until he were;<br>
And the ebb&#8217;d man, ne&#8217;er loved till ne&#8217;er worth
love,<br>
Comes dear&#8217;d by being lack&#8217;d. This common body,<br>
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,<br>
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,<br>
To rot itself with motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, I bring thee word,<br>
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,<br>
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound<br>
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads<br>
They make in Italy; the borders maritime<br>
Lack blood to think on&#8217;t, and flush youth revolt:<br>
No vessel can peep forth, but &#8217;tis as soon<br>
Taken as seen; for Pompey&#8217;s name strikes more<br>
Than could his war resisted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Antony,<br>
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once<br>
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew&#8217;st<br>
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel<br>
Did famine follow; whom thou fought&#8217;st against,<br>
Though daintily brought up, with patience more<br>
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink<br>
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle<br>
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign<br>
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;<br>
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,<br>
The barks of trees thou browsed&#8217;st; on the Alps<br>
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,<br>
Which some did die to look on: and all this&#8212;<br>
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now&#8212;<br>
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek<br>
So much as lank&#8217;d not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis pity of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Let his shames quickly<br>
Drive him to Rome: &#8217;tis time we twain<br>
Did show ourselves i&#8217; the field; and to that end<br>
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey<br>
Thrives in our idleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, Caesar,<br>
I shall be furnish&#8217;d to inform you rightly<br>
Both what by sea and land I can be able<br>
To front this present time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Till which encounter,<br>
It is my business too. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my lord: what you shall know
meantime<br>
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,<br>
To let me be partaker.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Doubt not, sir;<br>
I knew it for my bond.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha!<br>
Give me to drink mandragora.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Why, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That I might sleep out this great gap of time<br>
My Antony is away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You think of him too much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Madam, I trust, not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, eunuch Mardian!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mardian</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your highness&#8217; pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure<br>
In aught an eunuch has: &#8217;tis well for thee,<br>
That, being unseminar&#8217;d, thy freer thoughts<br>
May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mardian</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, gracious madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mardian</p>
<p class="speech">Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing<br>
But what indeed is honest to be done:<br>
Yet have I fierce affections, and think<br>
What Venus did with Mars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O Charmian,<br>
Where think&#8217;st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?<br>
Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?<br>
O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!<br>
Do bravely, horse! for wot&#8217;st thou whom thou movest?<br>
The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm<br>
And burgonet of men. He&#8217;s speaking now,<br>
Or murmuring &#8216;Where&#8217;s my serpent of old
Nile?&#8217;<br>
For so he calls me: now I feed myself<br>
With most delicious poison. Think on me,<br>
That am with Phoebus&#8217; amorous pinches black,<br>
And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,<br>
When thou wast here above the ground, I was<br>
A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey<br>
Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;<br>
There would he anchor his aspect and die<br>
With looking on his life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alexas, from Octavius
Caesar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Sovereign of Egypt, hail!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!<br>
Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath<br>
With his tinct gilded thee.<br>
How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Last thing he did, dear queen,<br>
He kiss&#8217;d,&#8212;the last of many doubled kisses,&#8212;<br>
This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Mine ear must pluck it thence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Good friend,&#8217; quoth he,<br>
&#8217;say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends<br>
This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,<br>
To mend the petty present, I will piece<br>
Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,<br>
Say thou, shall call her mistress.&#8217; So he nodded,<br>
And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,<br>
Who neigh&#8217;d so high, that what I would have spoke<br>
Was beastly dumb&#8217;d by him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">What, was he sad or merry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Like to the time o&#8217; the year between the
extremes<br>
Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O well-divided disposition! Note him,<br>
Note him good Charmian, &#8217;tis the man; but note him:<br>
He was not sad, for he would shine on those<br>
That make their looks by his; he was not merry,<br>
Which seem&#8217;d to tell them his remembrance lay<br>
In Egypt with his joy; but between both:<br>
O heavenly mingle! Be&#8217;st thou sad or merry,<br>
The violence of either thee becomes,<br>
So does it no man else. Met&#8217;st thou my posts?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:<br>
Why do you send so thick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s born that day<br>
When I forget to send to Antony,<br>
Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.<br>
Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,<br>
Ever love Caesar so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O that brave Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Be choked with such another emphasis!<br>
Say, the brave Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">The valiant Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,<br>
If thou with Caesar paragon again<br>
My man of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By your most gracious pardon,<br>
I sing but after you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">My salad days,<br>
When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,<br>
To say as I said then! But, come, away;<br>
Get me ink and paper:<br>
He shall have every day a several greeting,<br>
Or I&#8217;ll unpeople Egypt.</p>
