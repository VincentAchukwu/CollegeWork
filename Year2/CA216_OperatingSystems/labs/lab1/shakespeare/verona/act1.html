<h4>Scene I. Verona. An open place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine and
Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:<br>
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.<br>
Were&#8217;t not affection chains thy tender days<br>
To the sweet glances of thy honour&#8217;d love,<br>
I rather would entreat thy company<br>
To see the wonders of the world abroad,<br>
Than, living dully sluggardized at home,<br>
Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.<br>
But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,<br>
Even as I would when I to love begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!<br>
Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest<br>
Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:<br>
Wish me partaker in thy happiness<br>
When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,<br>
If ever danger do environ thee,<br>
Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,<br>
For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And on a love-book pray for my success?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon some book I love I&#8217;ll pray for
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s on some shallow story of deep
love:<br>
How young Leander cross&#8217;d the Hellespont.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a deep story of a deeper love:<br>
For he was more than over shoes in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; for you are over boots in
love,<br>
And yet you never swum the Hellespont.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will not, for it boots thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To be in love, where scorn is bought with
groans;<br>
Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment&#8217;s
mirth<br>
With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:<br>
If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;<br>
If lost, why then a grievous labour won;<br>
However, but a folly bought with wit,<br>
Or else a wit by folly vanquished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">So, by your circumstance, I fear you&#8217;ll
prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Love is your master, for he masters you:<br>
And he that is so yoked by a fool,<br>
Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud<br>
The eating canker dwells, so eating love<br>
Inhabits in the finest wits of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And writers say, as the most forward bud<br>
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,<br>
Even so by love the young and tender wit<br>
Is turn&#8217;d to folly, blasting in the bud,<br>
Losing his verdure even in the prime<br>
And all the fair effects of future hopes.<br>
But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,<br>
That art a votary to fond desire?<br>
Once more adieu! my father at the road<br>
Expects my coming, there to see me shipp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.<br>
To Milan let me hear from thee by letters<br>
Of thy success in love, and what news else<br>
Betideth here in absence of thy friend;<br>
And likewise will visit thee with mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">As much to you at home! and so, farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">He after honour hunts, I after love:<br>
He leaves his friends to dignify them more,<br>
I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.<br>
Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,<br>
Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,<br>
War with good counsel, set the world at nought;<br>
Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Speed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Twenty to one then he is shipp&#8217;d
already,<br>
And I have play&#8217;d the sheep in losing him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,<br>
An if the shepherd be a while away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You conclude that my master is a shepherd,
then,
and I a sheep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake
or sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">This proves me still a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">True; and thy master a shepherd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">It shall go hard but I&#8217;ll prove it by
another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep
the
shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
not me: therefore I am no sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Such another proof will make me cry
&#8216;baa.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to
Julia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to
her,
a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
lost mutton, nothing for my labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s too small a pasture for such store
of muttons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay: in that you are astray, &#8217;twere best
pound you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me
for
carrying your letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake; I mean the pound,&#8212;a
pinfold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
&#8217;Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
your lover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But what said she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[First nodding]</span>
Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Nod&#8212;Ay&#8212;why, that&#8217;s noddy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you
ask
me if she did nod; and I say, &#8216;Ay.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And that set together is noddy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Now you have taken the pains to set it
together,
take it for your pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; you shall have it for bearing the
letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why sir, how do you bear with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having
nothing
but the word &#8216;noddy&#8217; for my pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Come come, open the matter in brief: what said
she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Open your purse, that the money and the matter
may
be both at once delivered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said
she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, I think you&#8217;ll hardly win
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her;
no,
not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
fear she&#8217;ll prove as hard to you in telling your
mind. Give her no token but stones; for she&#8217;s as
hard as steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What said she? nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">No, not so much as &#8216;Take this for thy
pains.&#8217; To
testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
letters yourself: and so, sir, I&#8217;ll commend you to my
master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from
wreck,<br>
Which cannot perish having thee aboard,<br>
Being destined to a drier death on shore.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Speed</span></p>
<p class="speech">I must go send some better messenger:<br>
I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,<br>
Receiving them from such a worthless post.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter JullA and
Lucetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,<br>
Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Of all the fair resort of gentlemen<br>
That every day with parle encounter me,<br>
In thy opinion which is worthiest love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Please you repeat their names, I&#8217;ll show my
mind<br>
According to my shallow simple skill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the fair Sir
Eglamour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;<br>
But, were I you, he never should be mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the rich
Mercatio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou of the gentle
Proteus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what means this passion at his name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, dear madam: &#8217;tis a passing
shame<br>
That I, unworthy body as I am,<br>
Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus: of many good I think him best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I have no other, but a woman&#8217;s reason;<br>
I think him so because I think him so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves
ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">His little speaking shows his love but small.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Fire that&#8217;s closest kept burns most of
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">They do not love that do not show their love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">O, they love least that let men know their
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I would I knew his mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Peruse this paper, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;To Julia.&#8217; Say, from whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">That the contents will show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Say, say, who gave it thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Valentine&#8217;s page; and sent, I think, from
Proteus.<br>
He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,<br>
Did in your name receive it: pardon the
fault I pray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!<br>
Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?<br>
To whisper and conspire against my youth?<br>
Now, trust me, &#8217;tis an office of great worth<br>
And you an officer fit for the place.<br>
Or else return no more into my sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">To plead for love deserves more fee than
hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Will ye be gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That you may ruminate.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I would I had o&#8217;erlooked the
letter:<br>
It were a shame to call her back again<br>
And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.<br>
What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,<br>
And would not force the letter to my view!<br>
Since maids, in modesty, say &#8216;no&#8217; to that<br>
Which they would have the profferer construe &#8216;ay.&#8217;<br>
Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love<br>
That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse<br>
And presently all humbled kiss the rod!<br>
How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,<br>
When willingly I would have had her here!<br>
How angerly I taught my brow to frown,<br>
When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!<br>
My penance is to call Lucetta back<br>
And ask remission for my folly past.<br>
What ho! Lucetta!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucetta</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>

<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t near dinner-time?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were,<br>
That you might kill your stomach on your meat<br>
And not upon your maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t that you took up so gingerly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Why didst thou stoop, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">To take a paper up that I let fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And is that paper nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing concerning me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Then let it lie for those that it concerns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, it will not lie where it concerns<br>
Unless it have a false interpeter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.<br>
Give me a note: your ladyship can set.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">As little by such toys as may be possible.<br>
Best sing it to the tune of &#8216;Light o&#8217; love.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">It is too heavy for so light a tune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And why not you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot reach so high.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s see your song. How now, minion!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Keep tune there still, so you will sing it
out:<br>
And yet methinks I do not like this tune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">You do not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, madam; it is too sharp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">You, minion, are too saucy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, now you are too flat<br>
And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:<br>
There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">The mean is drown&#8217;d with your unruly
bass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.<br>
Here is a coil with protestation!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Tears the letter</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:<br>
You would be fingering them, to anger me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">She makes it strange; but she would be best
pleased<br>
To be so anger&#8217;d with another letter.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, would I were so anger&#8217;d
with the same!<br>
O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!<br>
Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey<br>
And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!<br>
I&#8217;ll kiss each several paper for amends.<br>
Look, here is writ &#8216;kind Julia.&#8217; Unkind Julia!<br>
As in revenge of thy ingratitude,<br>
I throw thy name against the bruising stones,<br>
Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.<br>
And here is writ &#8216;love-wounded Proteus.&#8217;<br>
Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed<br>
Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal&#8217;d;<br>
And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.<br>
But twice or thrice was &#8216;Proteus&#8217; written down.<br>
Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away<br>
Till I have found each letter in the letter,<br>
Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear<br>
Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock<br>
And throw it thence into the raging sea!<br>
Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,<br>
&#8216;Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,<br>
To the sweet Julia:&#8217; that I&#8217;ll tear away.<br>
And yet I will not, sith so prettily<br>
He couples it to his complaining names.<br>
Thus will I fold them one on another:<br>
Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.</p>

Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He wonder&#8217;d that your
lordship<br>
Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,<br>
While other men, of slender reputation,<br>
Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:<br>
Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;<br>
Some to discover islands far away;<br>
Some to the studious universities.<br>
For any or for all these exercises,<br>
He said that Proteus your son was meet,<br>
And did request me to importune you<br>
To let him spend his time no more at home,<br>
Which would be great impeachment to his age,<br>
In having known no travel in his youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nor need&#8217;st thou much importune me to
that<br>
Whereon this month I have been hammering.<br>
I have consider&#8217;d well his loss of time<br>
And how he cannot be a perfect man,<br>
Not being tried and tutor&#8217;d in the world:<br>
Experience is by industry achieved<br>
And perfected by the swift course of time.<br>
Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">I think your lordship is not ignorant<br>
How his companion, youthful Valentine,<br>
Attends the emperor in his royal court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I know it well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere good, I think, your lordship sent
him thither:<br>
There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,<br>
Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.<br>
And be in eye of every exercise<br>
Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:<br>
And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,<br>
The execution of it shall make known.<br>
Even with the speediest expedition<br>
I will dispatch him to the emperor&#8217;s court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,<br>
With other gentlemen of good esteem,<br>
Are journeying to salute the emperor<br>
And to commend their service to his will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Good company; with them shall Proteus go:<br>
And, in good time! now will we break with him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!<br>
Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;<br>
Here is her oath for love, her honour&#8217;s pawn.<br>
O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,<br>
To seal our happiness with their consents!<br>
O heavenly Julia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what letter are you reading there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">May&#8217;t please your lordship, &#8217;tis a
word or two<br>
Of commendations sent from Valentine,<br>
Deliver&#8217;d by a friend that came from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Lend me the letter; let me see what news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">There is no news, my lord, but that he writes<br>
How happily he lives, how well beloved<br>
And daily graced by the emperor;<br>
Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And how stand you affected to his wish?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">As one relying on your lordship&#8217;s will<br>
And not depending on his friendly wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">My will is something sorted with his wish.<br>
Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;<br>
For what I will, I will, and there an end.<br>
I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time<br>
With Valentinus in the emperor&#8217;s court:<br>
What maintenance he from his friends receives,<br>
Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.<br>
To-morrow be in readiness to go:<br>
Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:<br>
Please you, deliberate a day or two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what thou want&#8217;st shall be sent after
thee:<br>
No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.<br>
Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ&#8217;d<br>
To hasten on his expedition.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Antonio and
Panthino</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Thus have I shunn&#8217;d the fire for fear of
burning,<br>
And drench&#8217;d me in the sea, where I am drown&#8217;d.<br>
I fear&#8217;d to show my father Julia&#8217;s letter,<br>
Lest he should take exceptions to my love;<br>
And with the vantage of mine own excuse<br>
Hath he excepted most against my love.<br>
O, how this spring of love resembleth<br>
The uncertain glory of an April day,<br>
Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,<br>
And by and by a cloud takes all away!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Panthino</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:<br>
He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,<br>
And yet a thousand times it answers &#8216;no.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
