<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gower</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Before the palace of
Antioch</span></p>
<p class="speech">To sing a song that old was sung,<br>
From ashes ancient Gower is come;<br>
Assuming man&#8217;s infirmities,<br>
To glad your ear, and please your eyes.<br>
It hath been sung at festivals,<br>
On ember-eves and holy-ales;<br>
And lords and ladies in their lives<br>
Have read it for restoratives:<br>
The purchase is to make men glorious;<br>
Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.<br>
If you, born in these latter times,<br>
When wit&#8217;s more ripe, accept my rhymes.<br>
And that to hear an old man sing<br>
May to your wishes pleasure bring<br>
I life would wish, and that I might<br>
Waste it for you, like taper-light.<br>
This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great<br>
Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:<br>
The fairest in all Syria,<br>
I tell you what mine authors say:<br>
This king unto him took a fere,<br>
Who died and left a female heir,<br>
So buxom, blithe, and full of face,<br>
As heaven had lent her all his grace;<br>
With whom the father liking took,<br>
And her to incest did provoke:<br>
Bad child; worse father! to entice his own<br>
To evil should be done by none:<br>
But custom what they did begin<br>
Was with long use account no sin.<br>
The beauty of this sinful dame<br>
Made many princes thither frame,<br>
To seek her as a bed-fellow,<br>
In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:<br>
Which to prevent he made a law,<br>
To keep her still, and men in awe,<br>
That whoso ask&#8217;d her for his wife,<br>
His riddle told not, lost his life:<br>
So for her many a wight did die,<br>
As yon grim looks do testify.<br>
What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye<br>
I give, my cause who best can justify.</p>

<h4>Scene I. Antioch. A room in the palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antiochus, Prince
Pericles, and followers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Young prince of Tyre, you have at large
received<br>
The danger of the task you undertake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul<br>
Embolden&#8217;d with the glory of her praise,<br>
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,<br>
For the embracements even of Jove himself;<br>
At whose conception, till Lucina reign&#8217;d,<br>
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,<br>
The senate-house of planets all did sit,<br>
To knit in her their best perfections.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music. Enter the Daughter of
Antiochus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">See where she comes, apparell&#8217;d like the
spring,<br>
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king<br>
Of every virtue gives renown to men!<br>
Her face the book of praises, where is read<br>
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence<br>
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath<br>
Could never be her mild companion.<br>
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,<br>
That have inflamed desire in my breast<br>
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,<br>
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,<br>
As I am son and servant to your will,<br>
To compass such a boundless happiness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Prince Pericles,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">That would be son to great Antiochus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,<br>
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch&#8217;d;<br>
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:<br>
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view<br>
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;<br>
And which, without desert, because thine eye<br>
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.<br>
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,<br>
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,<br>
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,<br>
That without covering, save yon field of stars,<br>
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid&#8217;s wars;<br>
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist<br>
For going on death&#8217;s net, whom none resist.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught<br>
My frail mortality to know itself,<br>
And by those fearful objects to prepare<br>
This body, like to them, to what I must;<br>
For death remember&#8217;d should be like a mirror,<br>
Who tells us life&#8217;s but breath, to trust it error.<br>
I&#8217;ll make my will then, and, as sick men do<br>
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,<br>
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;<br>
So I bequeath a happy peace to you<br>
And all good men, as every prince should do;<br>
My riches to the earth from whence they came;<br>
But my unspotted fire of love to you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To the Daughter of
Antiochus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thus ready for the way of life or death,<br>
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:<br>
Which read and not expounded, &#8217;tis decreed,<br>
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Daughter</p>
<p class="speech">Of all say&#8217;d yet, mayst thou prove
prosperous!<br>
Of all say&#8217;d yet, I wish thee happiness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,<br>
Nor ask advice of any other thought<br>
But faithfulness and courage.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He reads the
riddle</span></p>
<p class="speech">I am no viper, yet I feed<br>
On mother&#8217;s flesh which did me breed.<br>
I sought a husband, in which labour<br>
I found that kindness in a father:<br>
He&#8217;s father, son, and husband mild;<br>
I mother, wife, and yet his child.<br>
How they may be, and yet in two,<br>
As you will live, resolve it you.<br>
Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers<br>
That give heaven countless eyes to view men&#8217;s acts,<br>
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,<br>
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?<br>
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Takes hold of the hand of the
Daughter of Antiochus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Were not this glorious casket stored with
ill:<br>
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt<br>
For he&#8217;s no man on whom perfections wait<br>
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.<br>
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;<br>
Who, finger&#8217;d to make man his lawful music,<br>
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:<br>
But being play&#8217;d upon before your time,<br>
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.<br>
Good sooth, I care not for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.<br>
For that&#8217;s an article within our law,<br>
As dangerous as the rest. Your time&#8217;s expired:<br>
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Great king,<br>
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;<br>
&#8217;Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.<br>
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,<br>
He&#8217;s more secure to keep it shut than shown:<br>
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.<br>
Blows dust in other&#8217;s eyes, to spread itself;<br>
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,<br>
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:<br>
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts<br>
Copp&#8217;d hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is
throng&#8217;d<br>
By man&#8217;s oppression; and the poor worm doth die
for&#8217;t.<br>
Kings are earth&#8217;s gods; in vice their law&#8217;s
their will;<br>
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?<br>
It is enough you know; and it is fit,<br>
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.<br>
All love the womb that their first being bred,<br>
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Heaven, that I
had thy head! he has found
the meaning:<br>
But I will gloze with him.&#8212;Young prince of Tyre,<br>
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,<br>
Your exposition misinterpreting,<br>
We might proceed to cancel of your days;<br>
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree<br>
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:<br>
Forty days longer we do respite you;<br>
If by which time our secret be undone,<br>
This mercy shows we&#8217;ll joy in such a son:<br>
And until then your entertain shall be<br>
As doth befit our honour and your worth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Pericles</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">How courtesy would seem to cover sin,<br>
When what is done is like an hypocrite,<br>
The which is good in nothing but in sight!<br>
If it be true that I interpret false,<br>
Then were it certain you were not so bad<br>
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;<br>
Where now you&#8217;re both a father and a son,<br>
By your untimely claspings with your child,<br>
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;<br>
And she an eater of her mother&#8217;s flesh,<br>
By the defiling of her parent&#8217;s bed;<br>
And both like serpents are, who though they feed<br>
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.<br>
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men<br>
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,<br>
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.<br>
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;<br>
Murder&#8217;s as near to lust as flame to smoke:<br>
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,<br>
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:<br>
Then, lest my lie be cropp&#8217;d to keep you clear,<br>
By flight I&#8217;ll shun the danger which I fear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Antiochus</p>
<p class="speech">He hath found the meaning, for which we mean<br>
To have his head.<br>
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,<br>
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin<br>
In such a loathed manner;<br>
And therefore instantly this prince must die:<br>
For by his fall my honour must keep high.<br>
Who attends us there?</p>

You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes<br>
Her private actions to your secrecy;<br>
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.<br>
Thaliard, behold, here&#8217;s poison, and here&#8217;s gold;<br>
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:<br>
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,<br>
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaliard</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>

<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Lords without]</span> Let
none disturb us.&#8212;Why should
this change of thoughts,<br>
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,<br>
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,<br>
In the day&#8217;s glorious walk, or peaceful night,<br>
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?<br>
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,<br>
And danger, which I fear&#8217;d, is at Antioch,<br>
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:<br>
Yet neither pleasure&#8217;s art can joy my spirits,<br>
Nor yet the other&#8217;s distance comfort me.<br>
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,<br>
That have their first conception by mis-dread,<br>
Have after-nourishment and life by care;<br>
And what was first but fear what might be done,<br>
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.<br>
And so with me: the great Antiochus,<br>
&#8217;Gainst whom I am too little to contend,<br>
Since he&#8217;s so great can make his will his act,<br>
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;<br>
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.<br>
If he suspect I may dishonour him:<br>
And what may make him blush in being known,<br>
He&#8217;ll stop the course by which it might be known;<br>
With hostile forces he&#8217;ll o&#8217;erspread the land,<br>
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,<br>
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;<br>
Our men be vanquish&#8217;d ere they do resist,<br>
And subjects punish&#8217;d that ne&#8217;er thought offence:<br>
Which care of them, not pity of myself,<br>
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,<br>
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,<br>
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,<br>
And punish that before that he would punish.</p>

Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!</p>

<p class="speech">And keep your mind, till you return to us,<br>
Peaceful and comfortable!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.<br>
They do abuse the king that flatter him:<br>
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;<br>
The thing which is flatter&#8217;d, but a spark,<br>
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;<br>
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,<br>
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.<br>
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,<br>
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.<br>
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;<br>
I cannot be much lower than my knees.</p>

frowns,<br>
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?</p>

whence<br>
They have their nourishment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>

Sit down: thou art no flatterer:<br>
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid<br>
That kings should let their ears hear their
faults hid!<br>
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,<br>
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,<br>
What wouldst thou have me do?</p>

Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.</p>

Helicanus,<br>
That minister&#8217;st a potion unto me<br>
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.<br>
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,<br>
Where as thou know&#8217;st, against the face of death,<br>
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.<br>
From whence an issue I might propagate,<br>
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.<br>
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;<br>
The rest&#8212;hark in thine ear&#8212;as black as incest:<br>
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father<br>
Seem&#8217;d not to strike, but smooth: but thou
know&#8217;st this,<br>
&#8217;Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.<br>
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,<br>
Under the covering of a careful night,<br>
Who seem&#8217;d my good protector; and, being here,<br>
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.<br>
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants&#8217; fears<br>
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:<br>
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,<br>
That I should open to the listening air<br>
How many worthy princes&#8217; bloods were shed,<br>
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,<br>
To lop that doubt, he&#8217;ll fill this land with arms,<br>
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:<br>
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,<br>
Must feel war&#8217;s blow, who spares not innocence:<br>
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,<br>
Who now reprovest me for it,&#8212;</p>

<p class="speech">Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my

Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts<br>
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;<br>
And finding little comfort to relieve them,<br>
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to
speak.<br>
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,<br>
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,<br>
Who either by public war or private treason<br>
Will take away your life.<br>
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,<br>
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,<br>
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.<br>
Your rule direct to any; if to me.<br>
Day serves not light more faithful than I&#8217;ll be.</p>

Tarsus<br>
Intend my travel, where I&#8217;ll hear from thee;<br>
And by whose letters I&#8217;ll dispose myself.<br>
The care I had and have of subjects&#8217; good<br>
On thee I lay whose wisdom&#8217;s strength can bear it.<br>
I&#8217;ll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:<br>
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:<br>
But in our orbs we&#8217;ll live so round and safe,<br>
That time of both this truth shall ne&#8217;er convince,<br>
Thou show&#8217;dst a subject&#8217;s shine, I a true prince.</p>

be hanged at home: &#8217;tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
had some reason for&#8217;t; for if a king bid a man be a

Thought nought too curious, are ready now<br>

So sharp are hunger&#8217;s teeth, that man and wife<br>
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:<br>
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;<br>

A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleon</p>

One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,<br>
That may succeed as his inheritor;<br>
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,<br>
Taking advantage of our misery,<br>
Hath stuff&#8217;d these hollow vessels with their power,<br>

What need we fear?<br>
The ground&#8217;s the lowest, and we are half way there.<br>

<p class="speaker">Third Fisherman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw
the
porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
they&#8217;re half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,
they ne&#8217;er come but I look to be washed. Master, I
marvel how the fishes live in the sea.</p>

the
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a&#8217; plays and
tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
have I heard on o&#8217; the land, who never leave gaping

The which the gods protect thee from!&#8212;may

It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;<br>
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,<br>
Took it in rage, though calm&#8217;d have given&#8217;t again:<br>
I thank thee for&#8217;t: my shipwreck now&#8217;s no ill,<br>
Since I have here my father&#8217;s gift in&#8217;s will.</p>

<p class="speech">What mean you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of
worth,<br>
For it was sometime target to a king;<br>
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,<br>
And for his sake I wish the having of it;<br>
And that you&#8217;ld guide me to your sovereign&#8217;s court,<br>
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;<br>
And if that ever my low fortune&#8217;s better,<br>
I&#8217;ll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Fisherman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll show the virtue I have borne in
arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Fisherman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, do &#8217;e take it, and the gods give thee
good on&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Fisherman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but hark you, my friend; &#8217;twas we that
made up
this garment through the rough seams of the waters:
there are certain condolements, certain vails. I
hope, sir, if you thrive, you&#8217;ll remember from
whence you had it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Believe &#8217;t, I will.<br>
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;<br>
And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,<br>
This jewel holds his building on my arm:<br>
Unto thy value I will mount myself<br>
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps<br>
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.<br>
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided<br>
Of a pair of bases.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Fisherman</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll sure provide: thou shalt have my best
gown to
make thee a pair; and I&#8217;ll bring thee to the court
myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>

This day I&#8217;ll rise, or else add ill to ill.</p>

These cates resist me, she but thought upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>

All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.<br>
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he&#8217;s a gallant gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simonides</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s but a country gentleman;<br>

Which tells me in that glory once he was;<br>
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,<br>
And he the sun, for them to reverence;<br>
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,<br>
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:<br>
Where now his son&#8217;s like a glow-worm in the night,<br>
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:<br>
Whereby I see that Time&#8217;s the king of men,<br>
He&#8217;s both their parent, and he is their grave,<br>
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.</p>

To honour them:<br>
And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,<br>
Which make a sound, but kill&#8217;d are wonder&#8217;d at.<br>
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,<br>
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, my father, it befits not me<br>
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:<br>
He may my proffer take for an offence,<br>
Since men take women&#8217;s gifts for impudence.</p>

Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,<br>
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.<br>
Even in your armours, as you are address&#8217;d,<br>
Will very well become a soldier&#8217;s dance.<br>

A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!<br>
&#8217;Tis the king&#8217;s subtlety to have my life.<br>
O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,<br>
A stranger and distressed gentleman,<br>
That never aim&#8217;d so high to love your daughter,<br>

I&#8217;ll tame you; I&#8217;ll bring you in subjection.<br>

Man and wife:<br>
Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:<br>
And being join&#8217;d, I&#8217;ll thus your hopes destroy;<br>
And for a further grief,&#8212;God give you joy!&#8212;<br>

Dumb Show.</p>

at one door, with Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and
gives Pericles a letter: Pericles shows it Simonides; the Lords
kneel to him. Then enter Thaisa with child, with Lychorida a nurse.
The King shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and Pericles takes
leave of her father, and depart with Lychorida and their
Attendants. Then exeunt Simonides and the rest</span></p>
<p class="speech">By many a dern and painful perch<br>
Of Pericles the careful search,<br>
By the four opposing coigns<br>
Which the world together joins,<br>
Is made with all due diligence<br>
That horse and sail and high expense<br>
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,<br>
Fame answering the most strange inquire,<br>
To the court of King Simonides<br>
Are letters brought, the tenor these:<br>
Antiochus and his daughter dead;<br>
The men of Tyrus on the head<br>
Of Helicanus would set on<br>
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:<br>
The mutiny he there hastes t&#8217; oppress;<br>
Says to &#8217;em, if King Pericles<br>
Come not home in twice six moons,<br>
He, obedient to their dooms,<br>
Will take the crown. The sum of this,<br>
Brought hither to Pentapolis,<br>
Y-ravished the regions round,<br>
And every one with claps can sound,<br>
&#8216;Our heir-apparent is a king!<br>
Who dream&#8217;d, who thought of such a thing?&#8217;<br>
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:<br>
His queen with child makes her desire&#8212;<br>
Which who shall cross?&#8212;along to go:<br>
Omit we all their dole and woe:<br>
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,<br>
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes<br>
On Neptune&#8217;s billow; half the flood<br>
Hath their keel cut: but fortune&#8217;s mood<br>
Varies again; the grisly north<br>
Disgorges such a tempest forth,<br>
That, as a duck for life that dives,<br>
So up and down the poor ship drives:<br>
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near<br>
Does fall in travail with her fear:<br>

Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,<br>
Having call&#8217;d them from the deep! O, still<br>
Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench<br>
Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,<br>
How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;<br>
Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman&#8217;s whistle<br>
Is as a whisper in the ears of death,<br>
Unheard. Lychorida!&#8212;Lucina, O<br>
Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle<br>
To those that cry by night, convey thy deity<br>
Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs<br>
Of my queen&#8217;s travails!</p>

Infant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, Lychorida!</p>

Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I<br>

<p class="speaker">Lychorida</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.<br>
Here&#8217;s all that is left living of your queen,<br>
A little daughter: for the sake of it,<br>
Be manly, and take comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">O you gods!<br>
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,<br>
And snatch them straight away? We here below<br>
Recall not what we give, and therein may<br>
Use honour with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lychorida</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good sir,<br>
Even for this charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Now, mild may be thy life!<br>
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:<br>
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for<br>
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world<br>
That ever was prince&#8217;s child. Happy what follows!<br>
Thou hast as chiding a nativity<br>
As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,<br>
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first<br>
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,<br>
With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods<br>
Throw their best eyes upon&#8217;t!</p>

<p class="speaker">First Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">What courage, sir? God save you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;<br>
It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love<br>
Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,<br>
I would it would be quiet.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt
thou?<br>
Blow, and split thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow
kiss
the moon, I care not.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works
high,
the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
cleared of the dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s your superstition.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been
still
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">As you think meet. Most wretched queen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lychorida</p>
<p class="speech">Here she lies, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;<br>
No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements<br>
Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time<br>
To give thee hallow&#8217;d to thy grave, but straight<br>
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin&#8217;d, in the ooze;<br>
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,<br>
And e&#8217;er-remaining lamps, the belching whale<br>
And humming water must o&#8217;erwhelm thy corpse,<br>
Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,<br>
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,<br>
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander<br>
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe<br>
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say<br>
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Lychorida</span></p>

this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">We are near Tarsus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Thither, gentle mariner.<br>
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Sailor</p>
<p class="speech">By break of day, if the wind cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">O, make for Tarsus!<br>
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe<br>
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I&#8217;ll leave it<br>
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:<br>
I&#8217;ll bring the body presently.</p>

Why do you stir so early?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,<br>
Shook as the earth did quake;<br>
The very principals did seem to rend,<br>
And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear<br>
Made me to quit the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">That is the cause we trouble you so early;<br>

<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>

<p class="speech">But I much marvel that your lordship, having<br>
Rich tire about you, should at these early hours<br>
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.<br>

Nature should be so conversant with pain,<br>
Being thereto not compell&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">I hold it ever,<br>
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater<br>
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs<br>
May the two latter darken and expend;<br>
But immortality attends the former.<br>
Making a man a god. &#8217;Tis known, I ever<br>
Have studied physic, through which secret art,<br>
By turning o&#8217;er authorities, I have,<br>
Together with my practise, made familiar<br>
To me and to my aid the blest infusions<br>
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;<br>
And I can speak of the disturbances<br>
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me<br>
A more content in course of true delight<br>
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,<br>
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,<br>
To please the fool and death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Your honour has through Ephesus pour&#8217;d
forth<br>
Your charity, and hundreds call themselves<br>
Your creatures, who by you have been restored:<br>

Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon<br>

Welcomed and settled to his own desire.<br>
His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,<br>
Unto Diana there a votaress.<br>
Now to Marina bend your mind,<br>
Whom our fast-growing scene must find<br>
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train&#8217;d<br>
In music, letters; who hath gain&#8217;d<br>
Of education all the grace,<br>
Which makes her both the heart and place<br>
Of general wonder. But, alack,<br>
That monster envy, oft the wrack<br>
Of earned praise, Marina&#8217;s life<br>
Seeks to take off by treason&#8217;s knife.<br>
And in this kind hath our Cleon<br>
One daughter, and a wench full grown,<br>
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid<br>
Hight Philoten: and it is said<br>
For certain in our story, she<br>
Would ever with Marina be:<br>
Be&#8217;t when she weaved the sleided silk<br>
With fingers long, small, white as milk;<br>
Or when she would with sharp needle wound<br>
The cambric, which she made more sound<br>
By hurting it; or when to the lute<br>
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,<br>
That still records with moan; or when<br>
She would with rich and constant pen<br>
Vail to her mistress Dian; still<br>
This Philoten contends in skill<br>
With absolute Marina: so<br>
With the dove of Paphos might the crow<br>
Vie feathers white. Marina gets<br>
All praises, which are paid as debts,<br>
And not as given. This so darks<br>
In Philoten all graceful marks,<br>
That Cleon&#8217;s wife, with envy rare,<br>
A present murderer does prepare<br>
For good Marina, that her daughter<br>
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.<br>
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,<br>
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:<br>
And cursed Dionyza hath<br>
The pregnant instrument of wrath<br>
Prest for this blow. The unborn event<br>
I do commend to your content:<br>
Only I carry winged time<br>
Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;<br>

With this unprofitable woe!<br>
Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.<br>
Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,<br>

Expect him here: when he shall come and find<br>
Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,<br>
He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;<br>
Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken<br>
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,<br>
Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve<br>
That excellent complexion, which did steal<br>
The eyes of young and old. Care not for me<br>

To any living creature: believe me, la,<br>
I never kill&#8217;d a mouse, nor hurt a fly:<br>
I trod upon a worm against my will,<br>

gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
too wenchless.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bawd</p>

<p class="speech">Be it so, then:<br>
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,<br>
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.<br>
She did disdain my child, and stood between<br>
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,<br>
But cast their gazes on Marina&#8217;s face;<br>
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin<br>
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;<br>
And though you call my course unnatural,<br>
You not your child well loving, yet I find<br>
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness<br>
Perform&#8217;d to your sole daughter.</p>

In glittering golden characters express<br>
A general praise to her, and care in us<br>
At whose expense &#8217;tis done.</p>

monument of Marina at Tarsus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make
short;<br>
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for&#8217;t;<br>
Making, to take your imagination,<br>
From bourn to bourn, region to region.<br>
By you being pardon&#8217;d, we commit no crime<br>
To use one language in each several clime<br>
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you<br>
To learn of me, who stand i&#8217; the gaps to teach you,<br>
The stages of our story. Pericles<br>
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,<br>
Attended on by many a lord and knight.<br>
To see his daughter, all his life&#8217;s delight.<br>
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late<br>
Advanced in time to great and high estate,<br>
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,<br>
Old Helicanus goes along behind.<br>
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought<br>
This king to Tarsus,&#8212;think his pilot thought;<br>
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,&#8212;<br>
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.<br>
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;<br>
Your ears unto your eyes I&#8217;ll reconcile.<br>
Dumb Show.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pericles, at one door,
with all his train; Cleon and Dionyza, at the other. Cleon shows
Pericles the tomb; whereat Pericles makes lamentation, puts on
sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt Cleon and
Dionyza</span></p>
<p class="speech">See how belief may suffer by foul show!<br>
This borrow&#8217;d passion stands for true old woe;<br>
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour&#8217;d,<br>
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
o&#8217;ershower&#8217;d,<br>
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears<br>
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:<br>
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears<br>
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,<br>
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.<br>
The epitaph is for Marina writ<br>
By wicked Dionyza.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads the inscription on
Marina&#8217;s monument</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;The fairest, sweet&#8217;st, and best lies
here,<br>
Who wither&#8217;d in her spring of year.<br>
She was of Tyrus the king&#8217;s daughter,<br>
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;<br>
Marina was she call&#8217;d; and at her birth,<br>
Thetis, being proud, swallow&#8217;d some part o&#8217; the
earth:<br>
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o&#8217;erflow&#8217;d,<br>
Hath Thetis&#8217; birth-child on the heavens bestow&#8217;d:<br>
Wherefore she does, and swears she&#8217;ll never stint,<br>
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.&#8217;<br>
No visor does become black villany<br>
So well as soft and tender flattery.<br>
Let Pericles believe his daughter&#8217;s dead,<br>
And bear his courses to be ordered<br>
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play<br>
His daughter&#8217;s woe and heavy well-a-day<br>
In her unholy service. Patience, then,<br>

Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,

Old receptacles, or common shores, of filth;<br>
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:<br>
Any of these ways are yet better than this;<br>

Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods<br>
Would safely deliver me from this place!<br>

If that thy master would gain by thee,<br>
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,<br>

And I will undertake all these to teach.<br>
I doubt not but this populous city will<br>
Yield many scholars.</p>

them.
But since my master and mistress have bought you,
there&#8217;s no going but by their consent: therefore I

<p class="speech">&#8217;Twould be too tedious to repeat;<br>
But the main grief springs from the loss<br>
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">May we not see him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">You may;<br>
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Yet let me obtain my wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Behold him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pericles
discovered</span></p>
<p class="speech">This was a goodly person,<br>
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,<br>
Drove him to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!<br>
Hail, royal sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">It is in vain; he will not speak to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,<br>
Would win some words of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well bethought.<br>
She questionless with her sweet harmony<br>
And other chosen attractions, would allure,<br>
And make a battery through his deafen&#8217;d parts,<br>
Which now are midway stopp&#8217;d:<br>
She is all happy as the fairest of all,<br>
And, with her fellow maids is now upon<br>
The leafy shelter that abuts against<br>
The island&#8217;s side.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Whispers a Lord, who goes off
in the barge of Lysimachus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, all&#8217;s effectless; yet nothing
we&#8217;ll omit<br>
That bears recovery&#8217;s name. But, since your kindness<br>
We have stretch&#8217;d thus far, let us beseech you<br>
That for our gold we may provision have,<br>
Wherein we are not destitute for want,<br>
But weary for the staleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, a courtesy<br>
Which if we should deny, the most just gods<br>
For every graff would send a caterpillar,<br>
And so afflict our province. Yet once more<br>
Let me entreat to know at large the cause<br>
Of your king&#8217;s sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:<br>
But, see, I am prevented.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter, from the barge,
Lord, with Marina, and a young Lady</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">O, here is<br>
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!<br>
Is&#8217;t not a goodly presence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a gallant lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s such a one, that, were I well
assured<br>
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,<br>
I&#8217;ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.<br>
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty<br>
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:<br>
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat<br>
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,<br>
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay<br>
As thy desires can wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will use<br>
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided<br>
That none but I and my companion maid<br>
Be suffer&#8217;d to come near him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let us leave her;<br>
And the gods make her prosperous!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Marina sings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark&#8217;d he your music?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor look&#8217;d on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">See, she will speak to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Hum, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">I am a maid,<br>
My lord, that ne&#8217;er before invited eyes,<br>
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,<br>
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief<br>
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh&#8217;d.<br>
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,<br>
My derivation was from ancestors<br>
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:<br>
But time hath rooted out my parentage,<br>
And to the world and awkward casualties<br>
Bound me in servitude.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I will desist;<br>
But there is something glows upon my cheek,<br>
And whispers in mine ear, &#8216;Go not till he speak.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">My fortunes&#8212;parentage&#8212;good
parentage&#8212;<br>
To equal mine!&#8212;was it not thus? what say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">I said, my lord, if you did know my
parentage,<br>
You would not do me violence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon
me.<br>
You are like something that&#8212;What country-woman?<br>
Here of these shores?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor of any shores:<br>
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am<br>
No other than I appear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I am great with woe, and shall deliver
weeping.<br>
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one<br>
My daughter might have been: my queen&#8217;s square brows;<br>
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;<br>
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like<br>
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;<br>
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,<br>
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Where I am but a stranger: from the deck<br>
You may discern the place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Where were you bred?<br>
And how achieved you these endowments, which<br>
You make more rich to owe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">If I should tell my history, it would seem<br>
Like lies disdain&#8217;d in the reporting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, speak:<br>
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look&#8217;st<br>
Modest as Justice, and thou seem&#8217;st a palace<br>
For the crown&#8217;d Truth to dwell in: I will
believe thee,<br>
And make my senses credit thy relation<br>
To points that seem impossible; for thou look&#8217;st<br>
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?<br>
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back&#8212;<br>
Which was when I perceived thee&#8212;that thou camest<br>
From good descending?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">So indeed I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Report thy parentage. I think thou
said&#8217;st<br>
Thou hadst been toss&#8217;d from wrong to injury,<br>
And that thou thought&#8217;st thy griefs might equal mine,<br>
If both were open&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Some such thing<br>
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts<br>
Did warrant me was likely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Tell thy story;<br>
If thine consider&#8217;d prove the thousandth part<br>
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I<br>
Have suffer&#8217;d like a girl: yet thou dost look<br>
Like Patience gazing on kings&#8217; graves, and smiling<br>
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?<br>
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?<br>
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">My name is Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, I am mock&#8217;d,<br>
And thou by some incensed god sent hither<br>
To make the world to laugh at me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, good sir,<br>
Or here I&#8217;ll cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll be patient.<br>
Thou little know&#8217;st how thou dost startle me,<br>
To call thyself Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">The name<br>
Was given me by one that had some power,<br>
My father, and a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">How! a king&#8217;s daughter?<br>
And call&#8217;d Marina?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You said you would believe me;<br>
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,<br>
I will end here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But are you flesh and blood?<br>
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?<br>
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?<br>
And wherefore call&#8217;d Marina?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Call&#8217;d Marina<br>
For I was born at sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">At sea! what mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">My mother was the daughter of a king;<br>
Who died the minute I was born,<br>
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft<br>
Deliver&#8217;d weeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, stop there a little!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">This is the rarest dream that e&#8217;er dull
sleep<br>
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:<br>
My daughter&#8217;s buried. Well: where were you bred?<br>
I&#8217;ll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,<br>
And never interrupt you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">You scorn: believe me, &#8217;twere best I did
give o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I will believe you by the syllable<br>
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:<br>
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;<br>
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,<br>
Did seek to murder me: and having woo&#8217;d<br>
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do&#8217;t,<br>
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;<br>
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,<br>
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?<br>
It may be,<br>
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;<br>
I am the daughter to King Pericles,<br>
If good King Pericles be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, Helicanus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Calls my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,<br>
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,<br>
What this maid is, or what is like to be,<br>
That thus hath made me weep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">I know not; but<br>
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene<br>
Speaks nobly of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">She would never tell<br>
Her parentage; being demanded that,<br>
She would sit still and weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">O Helicanus, strike me, honour&#8217;d sir;<br>
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;<br>
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me<br>
O&#8217;erbear the shores of my mortality,<br>
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,<br>
Thou that beget&#8217;st him that did thee beget;<br>
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,<br>
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,<br>
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud<br>
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.<br>
What was thy mother&#8217;s name? tell me but that,<br>
For truth can never be confirm&#8217;d enough,<br>
Though doubts did ever sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">First, sir, I pray,<br>
What is your title?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now<br>
My drown&#8217;d queen&#8217;s name, as in the rest you said<br>
Thou hast been godlike perfect,<br>
The heir of kingdoms and another like<br>
To Pericles thy father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marina</p>
<p class="speech">Is it no more to be your daughter than<br>
To say my mother&#8217;s name was Thaisa?<br>
Thaisa was my mother, who did end<br>
The minute I began.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my
child.<br>
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;<br>
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,<br>
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;<br>
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge<br>
She is thy very princess. Who is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, &#8217;tis the governor of Mytilene,<br>
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,<br>
Did come to see you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">I embrace you.<br>
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.<br>
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?<br>
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him<br>
O&#8217;er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,<br>
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helicanus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I hear none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">None!<br>
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">It is not good to cross him; give him way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I hear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Most heavenly music!<br>
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber<br>
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysimachus</p>
<p class="speech">A pillow for his head:<br>
So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,<br>
If this but answer to my just belief,<br>
I&#8217;ll well remember you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Pericles</span></p>

There, when my maiden priests are met together,<br>

To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter&#8217;s, call<br>
And give them repetition to the life.<br>
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lysimachus</span></p>

And give you gold for such provision<br>
As our intents will need?</p>

With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,<br>
I have another suit.</p>

What pageantry, what feats, what shows,<br>
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,<br>

To greet the king. So he thrived,<br>
That he is promised to be wived<br>
To fair Marina; but in no wise<br>
Till he had done his sacrifice,<br>

<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,<br>
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;<br>
Who, frighted from my country, did wed<br>
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.<br>
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth<br>
A maid-child call&#8217;d Marina; who, O goddess,<br>
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus<br>
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years<br>
He sought to murder: but her better stars<br>
Brought her to Mytilene; &#8217;gainst whose shore<br>
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,<br>
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she<br>

This is your wife.</p>

Early in blustering morn this lady was<br>
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,<br>
Found there rich jewels; recover&#8217;d her, and placed her<br>
Here in Diana&#8217;s temple.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">May we see them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cerimon</p>
<p class="speech">Great sir, they shall be brought you to my

Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me look!<br>
If he be none of mine, my sanctity<br>
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,<br>
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,<br>
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,<br>

How possibly preserved; and who to thank,<br>
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.</p>

Beseech you, first go with me to my house,<br>

Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;<br>
And what this fourteen years no razor touch&#8217;d,<br>
To grace thy marriage-day, I&#8217;ll beautify.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thaisa</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit,
sir,<br>
My father&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pericles</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my
queen,<br>
We&#8217;ll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves<br>
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:<br>
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.<br>
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay<br>
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead&#8217;s the way.</p>

<p class="speech">In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<br>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<br>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,<br>
Although assail&#8217;d with fortune fierce and keen,<br>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction&#8217;s blast,<br>
Led on by heaven, and crown&#8217;d with joy at last:<br>
In Helicanus may you well descry<br>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<br>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears<br>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<br>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<br>
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour&#8217;d name<br>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<br>
That him and his they in his palace burn;<br>
The gods for murder seemed so content<br>
To punish them; although not done, but meant.<br>
So, on your patience evermore attending,<br>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.</p>
