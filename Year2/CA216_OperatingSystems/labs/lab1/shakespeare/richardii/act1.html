<h4>Scene I. London. King Richard II&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard II, John
Of Gaunt, with other Nobles and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Old John of Gaunt, time-honour&#8217;d
Lancaster,<br>
Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,<br>
Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,<br>
Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,<br>
Which then our leisure would not let us hear,<br>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">I have, my liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,<br>
If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;<br>
Or worthily, as a good subject should,<br>
On some known ground of treachery in him?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">As near as I could sift him on that argument,<br>
On some apparent danger seen in him<br>
Aim&#8217;d at your highness, no inveterate malice.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Then call them to our presence; face to face,<br>
And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear<br>
The accuser and the accused freely speak:<br>
High-stomach&#8217;d are they both, and full of ire,<br>
In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Henry Bolingbroke and
Thomas Mowbray</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Many years of happy days befal<br>
My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Each day still better other&#8217;s
happiness;<br>
Until the heavens, envying earth&#8217;s good hap,<br>
Add an immortal title to your crown!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,<br>
As well appeareth by the cause you come;<br>
Namely to appeal each other of high treason.<br>
Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object<br>
Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">First, heaven be the record to my speech!<br>
In the devotion of a subject&#8217;s love,<br>
Tendering the precious safety of my prince,<br>
And free from other misbegotten hate,<br>
Come I appellant to this princely presence.<br>
Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,<br>
And mark my greeting well; for what I speak<br>
My body shall make good upon this earth,<br>
Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<br>
Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<br>
Too good to be so and too bad to live,<br>
Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,<br>
The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.<br>
Once more, the more to aggravate the note,<br>
With a foul traitor&#8217;s name stuff I thy throat;<br>
And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,<br>
What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:<br>
&#8217;Tis not the trial of a woman&#8217;s war,<br>
The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,<br>
Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;<br>
The blood is hot that must be cool&#8217;d for this:<br>
Yet can I not of such tame patience boast<br>
As to be hush&#8217;d and nought at all to say:<br>
First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me<br>
From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;<br>
Which else would post until it had return&#8217;d<br>
These terms of treason doubled down his throat.<br>
Setting aside his high blood&#8217;s royalty,<br>
And let him be no kinsman to my liege,<br>
I do defy him, and I spit at him;<br>
Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:<br>
Which to maintain I would allow him odds,<br>
And meet him, were I tied to run afoot<br>
Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,<br>
Or any other ground inhabitable,<br>
Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.<br>
Mean time let this defend my loyalty,<br>
By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,<br>
Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,<br>
And lay aside my high blood&#8217;s royalty,<br>
Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.<br>
If guilty dread have left thee so much strength<br>
As to take up mine honour&#8217;s pawn, then stoop:<br>
By that and all the rites of knighthood else,<br>
Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,<br>
What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">I take it up; and by that sword I swear<br>
Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,<br>
I&#8217;ll answer thee in any fair degree,<br>
Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:<br>
And when I mount, alive may I not light,<br>
If I be traitor or unjustly fight!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray&#8217;s
charge?<br>
It must be great that can inherit us<br>
So much as of a thought of ill in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it
true;<br>
That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles<br>
In name of lendings for your highness&#8217; soldiers,<br>
The which he hath detain&#8217;d for lewd employments,<br>
Like a false traitor and injurious villain.<br>
Besides I say and will in battle prove,<br>
Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge<br>
That ever was survey&#8217;d by English eye,<br>
That all the treasons for these eighteen years<br>
Complotted and contrived in this land<br>
Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.<br>
Further I say and further will maintain<br>
Upon his bad life to make all this good,<br>
That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,<br>
And consequently, like a traitor coward,<br>
Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:<br>
Which blood, like sacrificing Abel&#8217;s, cries,<br>
Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,<br>
To me for justice and rough chastisement;<br>
And, by the glorious worth of my descent,<br>
This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">How high a pitch his resolution soars!<br>
Thomas of Norfolk, what say&#8217;st thou to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">O, let my sovereign turn away his face<br>
And bid his ears a little while be deaf,<br>
Till I have told this slander of his blood,<br>
How God and good men hate so foul a liar.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:<br>
Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom&#8217;s heir,<br>
As he is but my father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son,<br>
Now, by my sceptre&#8217;s awe, I make a vow,<br>
Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood<br>
Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize<br>
The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:<br>
He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:<br>
Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,<br>
Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.<br>
Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais<br>
Disbursed I duly to his highness&#8217; soldiers;<br>
The other part reserved I by consent,<br>
For that my sovereign liege was in my debt<br>
Upon remainder of a dear account,<br>
Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:<br>
Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
I slew him not; but to my own disgrace<br>
Neglected my sworn duty in that case.<br>
For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,<br>
The honourable father to my foe<br>
Once did I lay an ambush for your life,<br>
A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul<br>
But ere I last received the sacrament<br>
I did confess it, and exactly begg&#8217;d<br>
Your grace&#8217;s pardon, and I hope I had it.<br>
This is my fault: as for the rest appeall&#8217;d,<br>
It issues from the rancour of a villain,<br>
A recreant and most degenerate traitor<br>
Which in myself I boldly will defend;<br>
And interchangeably hurl down my gage<br>
Upon this overweening traitor&#8217;s foot,<br>
To prove myself a loyal gentleman<br>
Even in the best blood chamber&#8217;d in his bosom.<br>
In haste whereof, most heartily I pray<br>
Your highness to assign our trial day.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;<br>
Let&#8217;s purge this choler without letting blood:<br>
This we prescribe, though no physician;<br>
Deep malice makes too deep incision;<br>
Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;<br>
Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.<br>
Good uncle, let this end where it begun;<br>
We&#8217;ll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">To be a make-peace shall become my age:<br>
Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk&#8217;s gage.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">And, Norfolk, throw down his.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">When, Harry, when?<br>
Obedience bids I should not bid again.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no
boot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.<br>
My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:<br>
The one my duty owes; but my fair name,<br>
Despite of death that lives upon my grave,<br>
To dark dishonour&#8217;s use thou shalt not have.<br>
I am disgraced, impeach&#8217;d and baffled here,<br>
Pierced to the soul with slander&#8217;s venom&#8217;d spear,<br>
The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood<br>
Which breathed this poison.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Rage must be withstood:<br>
Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, but not change his spots: take but my
shame.<br>
And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,<br>
The purest treasure mortal times afford<br>
Is spotless reputation: that away,<br>
Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.<br>
A jewel in a ten-times-barr&#8217;d-up chest<br>
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.<br>
Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:<br>
Take honour from me, and my life is done:<br>
Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;<br>
In that I live and for that will I die.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!<br>
Shall I seem crest-fall&#8217;n in my father&#8217;s sight?<br>
Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height<br>
Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue<br>
Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,<br>
Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear<br>
The slavish motive of recanting fear,<br>
And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,<br>
Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray&#8217;s face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit John Of Gaunt</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We were not born to sue, but to command;<br>
Which since we cannot do to make you friends,<br>
Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,<br>
At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert&#8217;s day:<br>
There shall your swords and lances arbitrate<br>
The swelling difference of your settled hate:<br>
Since we can not atone you, we shall see<br>
Justice design the victor&#8217;s chivalry.<br>
Lord marshal, command our officers at arms<br>
Be ready to direct these home alarms.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The Duke Of Lancaster&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter John Of Gaunt with
Duchess</span></p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the part I had in Woodstock&#8217;s
blood<br>
Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,<br>
To stir against the butchers of his life!<br>
But since correction lieth in those hands<br>
Which made the fault that we cannot correct,<br>
Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;<br>
Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,<br>
Will rain hot vengeance on offenders&#8217; heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?<br>
Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?<br>
Edward&#8217;s seven sons, whereof thyself art one,<br>
Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,<br>
Or seven fair branches springing from one root:<br>
Some of those seven are dried by nature&#8217;s course,<br>
Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;<br>
But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,<br>
One vial full of Edward&#8217;s sacred blood,<br>
One flourishing branch of his most royal root,<br>
Is crack&#8217;d, and all the precious liquor spilt,<br>
Is hack&#8217;d down, and his summer leaves all faded,<br>
By envy&#8217;s hand and murder&#8217;s bloody axe.<br>
Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,<br>
That metal, that self-mould, that fashion&#8217;d thee<br>
Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,<br>
Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent<br>
In some large measure to thy father&#8217;s death,<br>
In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,<br>
Who was the model of thy father&#8217;s life.<br>
Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:<br>
In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter&#8217;d,<br>
Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,<br>
Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:<br>
That which in mean men we intitle patience<br>
Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.<br>
What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,<br>
The best way is to venge my Gloucester&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s is the quarrel; for God&#8217;s
substitute,<br>
His deputy anointed in His sight,<br>
Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,<br>
Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift<br>
An angry arm against His minister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Where then, alas, may I complain myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">To God, the widow&#8217;s champion and
defence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.<br>
Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold<br>
Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:<br>
O, sit my husband&#8217;s wrongs on Hereford&#8217;s spear,<br>
That it may enter butcher Mowbray&#8217;s breast!<br>
Or, if misfortune miss the first career,<br>
Be Mowbray&#8217;s sins so heavy in his bosom,<br>
They may break his foaming courser&#8217;s back,<br>
And throw the rider headlong in the lists,<br>
A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!<br>
Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother&#8217;s wife<br>
With her companion grief must end her life.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:<br>
As much good stay with thee as go with me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess</p>
<p class="speech">Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it
falls,<br>
Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:<br>
I take my leave before I have begun,<br>
For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.<br>
Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.<br>
Lo, this is all:&#8212;nay, yet depart not so;<br>
Though this be all, do not so quickly go;<br>
I shall remember more. Bid him&#8212;ah, what?&#8212;<br>
With all good speed at Plashy visit me.<br>
Alack, and what shall good old York there see<br>
But empty lodgings and unfurnish&#8217;d walls,<br>
Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?<br>
And what hear there for welcome but my groans?<br>
Therefore commend me; let him not come there,<br>
To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.<br>
Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:<br>
The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.</p>

Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;<br>
And with thy blessings steel my lance&#8217;s point,<br>

To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,<br>
A traitor to his God, his king and him;<br>
And dares him to set forward to the fight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Herald</p>
<p class="speech">Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of
Norfolk,<br>
On pain to be found false and recreant,<br>
Both to defend himself and to approve<br>
Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,<br>
To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;<br>
Courageously and with a free desire<br>
Attending but the signal to begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A charge sounded</span></p>
<p class="speech">Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Let them lay by their helmets and their
spears,<br>
And both return back to their chairs again:<br>
Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound<br>
While we return these dukes what we decree.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A long flourish</span></p>
<p class="speech">Draw near,<br>
And list what with our council we have done.<br>
For that our kingdom&#8217;s earth should not be soil&#8217;d<br>
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;<br>
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect<br>
Of civil wounds plough&#8217;d up with neighbours&#8217; sword;<br>
And for we think the eagle-winged pride<br>
Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,<br>
With rival-hating envy, set on you<br>
To wake our peace, which in our country&#8217;s cradle<br>
Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;<br>
Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,<br>
With harsh resounding trumpets&#8217; dreadful bray,<br>
And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,<br>
Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace<br>
And make us wade even in our kindred&#8217;s blood,<br>
Therefore, we banish you our territories:<br>
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,<br>
Till twice five summers have enrich&#8217;d our fields<br>
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,<br>
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Your will be done: this must my comfort be,<br>
Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;<br>
And those his golden beams to you here lent<br>
Shall point on me and gild my banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,<br>
Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:<br>
The sly slow hours shall not determinate<br>
The dateless limit of thy dear exile;<br>
The hopeless word of &#8216;never to return&#8217;<br>
Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,<br>
And all unlook&#8217;d for from your highness&#8217; mouth:<br>
A dearer merit, not so deep a maim<br>
As to be cast forth in the common air,<br>
Have I deserved at your highness&#8217; hands.<br>
The language I have learn&#8217;d these forty years,<br>
My native English, now I must forego:<br>
And now my tongue&#8217;s use is to me no more<br>
Than an unstringed viol or a harp,<br>
Or like a cunning instrument cased up,<br>
Or, being open, put into his hands<br>
That knows no touch to tune the harmony:<br>
Within my mouth you have engaol&#8217;d my tongue,<br>
Doubly portcullis&#8217;d with my teeth and lips;<br>
And dull unfeeling barren ignorance<br>
Is made my gaoler to attend on me.<br>
I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,<br>
Too far in years to be a pupil now:<br>
What is thy sentence then but speechless death,<br>
Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">It boots thee not to be compassionate:<br>
After our sentence plaining comes too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">Then thus I turn me from my country&#8217;s
light,<br>
To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Return again, and take an oath with thee.<br>
Lay on our royal sword your banish&#8217;d hands;<br>
Swear by the duty that you owe to God&#8212;<br>
Our part therein we banish with yourselves&#8212;<br>
To keep the oath that we administer:<br>
You never shall, so help you truth and God!<br>
Embrace each other&#8217;s love in banishment;<br>
Nor never look upon each other&#8217;s face;<br>
Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile<br>
This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;<br>
Nor never by advised purpose meet<br>
To plot, contrive, or complot any ill<br>
&#8217;Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I swear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">And I, to keep all this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:&#8212;<br>
By this time, had the king permitted us,<br>
One of our souls had wander&#8217;d in the air.<br>
Banish&#8217;d this frail sepulchre of our flesh,<br>
As now our flesh is banish&#8217;d from this land:<br>
Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;<br>
Since thou hast far to go, bear not along<br>
The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thomas Mowbray</p>
<p class="speech">No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,<br>
My name be blotted from the book of life,<br>
And I from heaven banish&#8217;d as from hence!<br>
But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;<br>
And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.<br>
Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;<br>
Save back to England, all the world&#8217;s my way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes<br>
I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect<br>
Hath from the number of his banish&#8217;d years<br>
Pluck&#8217;d four away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Henry
Bolingbroke</span></p>
<p class="speech">Six frozen winter spent,<br>
Return with welcome home from banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">How long a time lies in one little word!<br>
Four lagging winters and four wanton springs<br>
End in a word: such is the breath of kings.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">I thank my liege, that in regard of me<br>
He shortens four years of my son&#8217;s exile:<br>
But little vantage shall I reap thereby;<br>
For, ere the six years that he hath to spend<br>
Can change their moons and bring their times about<br>
My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light<br>
Shall be extinct with age and endless night;<br>
My inch of taper will be burnt and done,<br>
And blindfold death not let me see my son.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:<br>
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,<br>
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;<br>
Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,<br>
But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;<br>
Thy word is current with him for my death,<br>
But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Thy son is banish&#8217;d upon good advice,<br>
Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:<br>
Why at our justice seem&#8217;st thou then to lour?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Things sweet to taste prove in digestion
sour.<br>
You urged me as a judge; but I had rather<br>
You would have bid me argue like a father.<br>
O, had it been a stranger, not my child,<br>
To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:<br>
A partial slander sought I to avoid,<br>
And in the sentence my own life destroy&#8217;d.<br>
Alas, I look&#8217;d when some of you should say,<br>
I was too strict to make mine own away;<br>
But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue<br>
Against my will to do myself this wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:<br>
Six years we banish him, and he shall go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt King Richard
II and train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, farewell: what presence must not
know,<br>
From where you do remain let paper show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Marshal</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,<br>
As far as land will let me, by your side.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,<br>
That thou return&#8217;st no greeting to thy friends?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I have too few to take my leave of you,<br>
When the tongue&#8217;s office should be prodigal<br>
To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Joy absent, grief is present for that time.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">What is six winters? they are quickly gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Call it a travel that thou takest for
pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,<br>
Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">The sullen passage of thy weary steps<br>
Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set<br>
The precious jewel of thy home return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make<br>
Will but remember me what a deal of world<br>
I wander from the jewels that I love.<br>
Must I not serve a long apprenticehood<br>
To foreign passages, and in the end,<br>
Having my freedom, boast of nothing else<br>
But that I was a journeyman to grief?</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">All places that the eye of heaven visits<br>
Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.<br>
Teach thy necessity to reason thus;<br>
There is no virtue like necessity.<br>
Think not the king did banish thee,<br>
But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,<br>
Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.<br>
Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour<br>
And not the king exiled thee; or suppose<br>
Devouring pestilence hangs in our air<br>
And thou art flying to a fresher clime:<br>
Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it<br>
To lie that way thou go&#8217;st, not whence thou comest:<br>
Suppose the singing birds musicians,<br>
The grass whereon thou tread&#8217;st the presence
strew&#8217;d,<br>
The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more<br>
Than a delightful measure or a dance;<br>
For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite<br>
The man that mocks at it and sets it light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">O, who can hold a fire in his hand<br>
By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?<br>
Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite<br>
By bare imagination of a feast?<br>
Or wallow naked in December snow<br>
By thinking on fantastic summer&#8217;s heat?<br>
O, no! the apprehension of the good<br>
Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:<br>
Fell sorrow&#8217;s tooth doth never rankle more<br>
Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.</p>
<p class="speaker">John Of Gaunt</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, my son, I&#8217;ll bring thee on thy
way:<br>
Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Then, England&#8217;s ground, farewell; sweet
soil, adieu;<br>
My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!<br>
Where&#8217;er I wander, boast of this I can,<br>
Though banish&#8217;d, yet a trueborn Englishman.</p>

<h4>Scene IV. The court.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Richard II, with
Bagot and Green at one door; and the Duke Of Aumerle at
another</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,<br>
How far brought you high Hereford on his way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,<br>
But to the next highway, and there I left him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">And say, what store of parting tears were
shed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, none for me; except the north-east
wind,<br>
Which then blew bitterly against our faces,<br>
Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance<br>
Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">What said our cousin when you parted with
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Farewell:&#8217;<br>
And, for my heart disdained that my tongue<br>
Should so profane the word, that taught me craft<br>
To counterfeit oppression of such grief<br>
That words seem&#8217;d buried in my sorrow&#8217;s grave.<br>
Marry, would the word &#8216;farewell&#8217; have lengthen&#8217;d
hours<br>
And added years to his short banishment,<br>
He should have had a volume of farewells;<br>
But since it would not, he had none of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">He is our cousin, cousin; but &#8217;tis
doubt,<br>
When time shall call him home from banishment,<br>
Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.<br>
Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green<br>
Observed his courtship to the common people;<br>
How he did seem to dive into their hearts<br>
With humble and familiar courtesy,<br>
What reverence he did throw away on slaves,<br>
Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles<br>
And patient underbearing of his fortune,<br>
As &#8217;twere to banish their affects with him.<br>
Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;<br>
A brace of draymen bid God speed him well<br>
And had the tribute of his supple knee,<br>
With &#8216;Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;&#8217;<br>
As were our England in reversion his,<br>
And he our subjects&#8217; next degree in hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Green</p>
<p class="speech">Well, he is gone; and with him go these
thoughts.<br>
Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,<br>
Expedient manage must be made, my liege,<br>
Ere further leisure yield them further means<br>
For their advantage and your highness&#8217; loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">We will ourself in person to this war:<br>
And, for our coffers, with too great a court<br>
And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,<br>
We are inforced to farm our royal realm;<br>
The revenue whereof shall furnish us<br>
For our affairs in hand: if that come short,<br>
Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;<br>
Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,<br>
They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold<br>
And send them after to supply our wants;<br>
For we will make for Ireland presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bushy</span></p>
<p class="speech">Bushy, what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,<br>
Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste<br>
To entreat your majesty to visit him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Where lies he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bushy</p>
<p class="speech">At Ely House.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Now put it, God, in the physician&#8217;s
mind<br>
To help him to his grave immediately!<br>
The lining of his coffers shall make coats<br>
To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.<br>
Come, gentlemen, let&#8217;s all go visit him:<br>
Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!</p>
