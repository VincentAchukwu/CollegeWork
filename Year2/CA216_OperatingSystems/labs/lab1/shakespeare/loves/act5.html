<h4>Scene I. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Holofernes, Sir
Nathaniel, and Dull</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Satis quod sufficit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at
dinner
have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
a companion of the king&#8217;s, who is intituled, nomi-
nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty,
his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">A most singular and choice epithet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Draws out his
table-book</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">He draweth out the thread of his verbosity
finer
than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
point-devise companions; such rackers of
orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,&#8212;d,
e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,&#8212;which he
would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Laus Deo, bene intelligo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little
scratch&#8217;d,
&#8217;twill serve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Videsne quis venit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Video, et gaudeo.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don Adriano de Armado,
Moth, and Costard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Chirrah!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Moth</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Quare chirrah, not sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Men of peace, well encountered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Most military sir, salutation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Costard]</span>
They have been at a great feast
of languages, and stolen the scraps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of
words.
I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
for thou art not so long by the head as
honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
swallowed than a flap-dragon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! the peal begins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Holofernes]</span>
Monsieur, are you not lettered?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is
a,
b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his
learning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Quis, quis, thou consonant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them;
or
the fifth, if I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">I will repeat them,&#8212;a, e, i,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">The sheep: the other two concludes it,&#8212;o,
u.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a
sweet
touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Offered by a child to an old man; which is
wit-old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">What is the figure? what is the figure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Horns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy
gig.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip
about
your infamy circum circa,&#8212;a gig of a cuckold&#8217;s
horn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">An I had but one penny in the world, thou
shouldst
have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers&#8217;
ends, as they say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from
the
barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
charge-house on the top of the mountain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Or mons, the hill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">I do, sans question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is the king&#8217;s most sweet pleasure
and
affection to congratulate the princess at her
pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
rude multitude call the afternoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">The posterior of the day, most generous sir,
is
liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
assure you, sir, I do assure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my
familiar,
I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
head: and among other important and most serious
designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
The very all of all is,&#8212;but, sweet heart, I do
implore secrecy,&#8212;that the king would have me
present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
curate and your sweet self are good at such
eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
crave your assistance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you shall present before her the Nine
Worthies.
Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
our assistants, at the king&#8217;s command, and this most
gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
Nine Worthies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Where will you find men worthy enough to present
them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant
gentleman,
Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
page, Hercules,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough
for
that Worthy&#8217;s thumb: he is not so big as the end of his
club.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules
in
minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">An excellent device! so, if any of the
audience
hiss, you may cry &#8216;Well done, Hercules! now thou
crushest the snake!&#8217; that is the way to make an
offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">For the rest of the Worthies?&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">I will play three myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Thrice-worthy gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I tell you a thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">We attend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">We will have, if this fadge not, an antique.
I
beseech you, follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all
this while.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">Nor understood none neither, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Allons! we will employ thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dull</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll make one in a dance, or so; or I will
play<br>
On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Holofernes</p>
<p class="speech">Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Princess,
Katharine, Rosaline, and Maria</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,<br>
If fairings come thus plentifully in:<br>
A lady wall&#8217;d about with diamonds!<br>
Look you what I have from the loving king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madame, came nothing else along with that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme<br>
As would be cramm&#8217;d up in a sheet of paper,<br>
Writ o&#8217; both sides the leaf, margent and all,<br>
That he was fain to seal on Cupid&#8217;s name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">That was the way to make his godhead wax,<br>
For he hath been five thousand years a boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er be friends with him;
a&#8217; kill&#8217;d your sister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;<br>
And so she died: had she been light, like you,<br>
Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,<br>
She might ha&#8217; been a grandam ere she died:<br>
And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your dark meaning, mouse, of this
light word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A light condition in a beauty dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">We need more light to find your meaning out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll mar the light by taking it in
snuff;<br>
Therefore I&#8217;ll darkly end the argument.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Look what you do, you do it still i&#8217; the
dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">So do not you, for you are a light wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">You weigh me not? O, that&#8217;s you care not
for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Great reason; for &#8216;past cure is still past
care.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Well bandied both; a set of wit well
play&#8217;d.<br>
But Rosaline, you have a favour too:<br>
Who sent it? and what is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">I would you knew:<br>
An if my face were but as fair as yours,<br>
My favour were as great; be witness this.<br>
Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:<br>
The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,<br>
I were the fairest goddess on the ground:<br>
I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.<br>
O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Any thing like?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Fair as a text B in a copy-book.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your
debtor,<br>
My red dominical, my golden letter:<br>
O, that your face were not so full of O&#8217;s!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair
Dumain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, this glove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Did he not send you twain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam, and moreover<br>
Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,<br>
A huge translation of hypocrisy,<br>
Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:<br>
The letter is too long by half a mile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart<br>
The chain were longer and the letter short?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.<br>
That same Biron I&#8217;ll torture ere I go:<br>
O that I knew he were but in by the week!<br>
How I would make him fawn and beg and seek<br>
And wait the season and observe the times<br>
And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes<br>
And shape his service wholly to my hests<br>
And make him proud to make me proud that jests!<br>
So perttaunt-like would I o&#8217;ersway his state<br>
That he should be my fool and I his fate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">None are so surely caught, when they are
catch&#8217;d,<br>
As wit turn&#8217;d fool: folly, in wisdom hatch&#8217;d,<br>
Hath wisdom&#8217;s warrant and the help of school<br>
And wit&#8217;s own grace to grace a learned fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">The blood of youth burns not with such excess<br>
As gravity&#8217;s revolt to wantonness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Folly in fools bears not so strong a note<br>
As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;<br>
Since all the power thereof it doth apply<br>
To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am stabb&#8217;d with laughter!
Where&#8217;s her grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Thy news Boyet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Prepare, madam, prepare!<br>
Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are<br>
Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,<br>
Armed in arguments; you&#8217;ll be surprised:<br>
Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;<br>
Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they<br>
That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Under the cool shade of a sycamore<br>
I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;<br>
When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,<br>
Toward that shade I might behold addrest<br>
The king and his companions: warily<br>
I stole into a neighbour thicket by,<br>
And overheard what you shall overhear,<br>
That, by and by, disguised they will be here.<br>
Their herald is a pretty knavish page,<br>
That well by heart hath conn&#8217;d his embassage:<br>
Action and accent did they teach him there;<br>
&#8216;Thus must thou speak,&#8217; and &#8216;thus thy body
bear:&#8217;<br>
And ever and anon they made a doubt<br>
Presence majestical would put him out,<br>
&#8216;For,&#8217; quoth the king, &#8216;an angel shalt thou
see;<br>
Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.&#8217;<br>
The boy replied, &#8216;An angel is not evil;<br>
I should have fear&#8217;d her had she been a devil.&#8217;<br>
With that, all laugh&#8217;d and clapp&#8217;d him on the
shoulder,<br>
Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:<br>
One rubb&#8217;d his elbow thus, and fleer&#8217;d and swore<br>
A better speech was never spoke before;<br>
Another, with his finger and his thumb,<br>
Cried, &#8216;Via! we will do&#8217;t, come what will
come;&#8217;<br>
The third he caper&#8217;d, and cried, &#8216;All goes
well;&#8217;<br>
The fourth turn&#8217;d on the toe, and down he fell.<br>
With that, they all did tumble on the ground,<br>
With such a zealous laughter, so profound,<br>
That in this spleen ridiculous appears,<br>
To cheque their folly, passion&#8217;s solemn tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">But what, but what, come they to visit us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They do, they do: and are apparell&#8217;d
thus.<br>
Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.<br>
Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;<br>
And every one his love-feat will advance<br>
Unto his several mistress, which they&#8217;ll know<br>
By favours several which they did bestow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">And will they so? the gallants shall be
task&#8217;d;<br>
For, ladies, we shall every one be mask&#8217;d;<br>
And not a man of them shall have the grace,<br>
Despite of suit, to see a lady&#8217;s face.<br>
Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,<br>
And then the king will court thee for his dear;<br>
Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,<br>
So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.<br>
And change your favours too; so shall your loves<br>
Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, then; wear the favours most in
sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">But in this changing what is your intent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:<br>
They do it but in mocking merriment;<br>
And mock for mock is only my intent.<br>
Their several counsels they unbosom shall<br>
To loves mistook, and so be mock&#8217;d withal<br>
Upon the next occasion that we meet,<br>
With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">But shall we dance, if they desire
to&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">No, to the death, we will not move a foot;<br>
Nor to their penn&#8217;d speech render we no grace,<br>
But while &#8217;tis spoke each turn away her face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that contempt will kill the speaker&#8217;s
heart,<br>
And quite divorce his memory from his part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt<br>
The rest will ne&#8217;er come in, if he be out<br>
There&#8217;s no such sport as sport by sport o&#8217;erthrown,<br>
To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:<br>
So shall we stay, mocking intended game,<br>
And they, well mock&#8217;d, depart away with shame.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sound
within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">The trumpet sounds: be mask&#8217;d; the maskers

<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">Out of your favours, heavenly spirits,

Not to behold&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They will not answer to that epithet;<br>
You were best call it &#8216;daughter-beamed eyes.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Moth</p>
<p class="speech">They do not mark me, and that brings me out.</p>

<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">What would these strangers? know their minds,
Boyet:<br>
If they do speak our language, &#8217;tis our will:<br>
That some plain man recount their purposes<br>
Know what they would.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">What would you with the princess?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>

<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">She says, you have it, and you may be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Say to her, we have measured many miles<br>
To tread a measure with her on this grass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">They say, that they have measured many a mile<br>
To tread a measure with you on this grass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">It is not so. Ask them how many inches<br>
Is in one mile: if they have measured many,<br>
The measure then of one is easily told.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">If to come hither you have measured miles,<br>
And many miles, the princess bids you tell<br>
How many inches doth fill up one mile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">She hears herself.</p>

Of many weary miles you have o&#8217;ergone,<br>
Are number&#8217;d in the travel of one mile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">We number nothing that we spend for you:<br>
Our duty is so rich, so infinite,<br>
That we may do it still without accompt.<br>
Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,<br>
That we, like savages, may worship it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">My face is but a moon, and clouded too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!<br>
Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,<br>
Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;<br>
Thou now request&#8217;st but moonshine in the water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one
change.<br>
Thou bid&#8217;st me beg: this begging is not strange.</p>

<p class="speech">Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music plays</span></p>
<p class="speech">Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the
moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not dance? How come you thus
estranged?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">You took the moon at full, but now she&#8217;s
changed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.<br>
The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Our ears vouchsafe it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">But your legs should do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Since you are strangers and come here by
chance,<br>
We&#8217;ll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Why take we hands, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Only to part friends:<br>
Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">More measure of this measure; be not nice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">We can afford no more at such a price.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Your absence only.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That can never be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;<br>
Twice to your visor, and half once to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">If you deny to dance, let&#8217;s hold more

<p class="speech">Seventh sweet, adieu:<br>
Since you can cog, I&#8217;ll play no more with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">One word in secret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Let it not be sweet.</p>

<p class="speech">O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">You have a double tongue within your mask,<br>

<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not

<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>

<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll not be your half<br>
Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp
mocks!<br>
Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">One word in private with you, ere I die.</p>

<p class="speech">Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They converse

<p class="speech">The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen<br>
As is the razor&#8217;s edge invisible,<br>
Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,<br>
Above the sense of sense; so sensible<br>
Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings<br>
Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.</p>

off.</p>

<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat,
fat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!<br>
Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?<br>
Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?<br>
This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">O, they were all in lamentable cases!<br>
The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Biron did swear himself out of all suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Dumain was at my service, and his sword:<br>
No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>

<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:<br>
Immediately they will again be here<br>
In their own shapes; for it can never be<br>
They will digest this harsh indignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Will they return?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;They will, they will, God
knows,<br>
And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:<br>
Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,<br>
Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>

Dismask&#8217;d, their damask sweet commixture shown,<br>

If they return in their own shapes to woo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Good madam, if by me you&#8217;ll be advised,<br>
Let&#8217;s, mock them still, as well known as disguised:<br>
Let us complain to them what fools were here,<br>
Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;<br>
And wonder what they were and to what end<br>
Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn&#8217;d<br>
And their rough carriage so ridiculous,<br>
Should be presented at our tent to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,<br>
And utters it again when God doth please:<br>
He is wit&#8217;s pedler, and retails his wares<br>
At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;<br>
And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,<br>
Have not the grace to grace it with such show.<br>
This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;<br>
Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;<br>
A&#8217; can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he<br>
That kiss&#8217;d his hand away in courtesy;<br>
This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,<br>
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice<br>
In honourable terms: nay, he can sing<br>
A mean most meanly; and in ushering<br>
Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;<br>
The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:<br>
This is the flower that smiles on every one,<br>
To show his teeth as white as whale&#8217;s bone;<br>
And consciences, that will not die in debt,<br>
Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,<br>
That put Armado&#8217;s page out of his part!</p>

<p class="speech">&#8216;Fair&#8217; in &#8216;all hail&#8217; is
foul, as I conceive.</p>

<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Then wish me better; I will give you leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">We came to visit you, and purpose now<br>
To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">This field shall hold me; and so hold your
vow:<br>
Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:<br>
The virtue of your eye must break my oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">You nickname virtue; vice you should have
spoke;<br>
For virtue&#8217;s office never breaks men&#8217;s troth.<br>
Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure<br>
As the unsullied lily, I protest,<br>
A world of torments though I should endure,<br>
I would not yield to be your house&#8217;s guest;<br>
So much I hate a breaking cause to be<br>
Of heavenly oaths, vow&#8217;d with integrity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">O, you have lived in desolation here,<br>
Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;<br>
We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:<br>
A mess of Russians left us but of late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">How, madam! Russians!</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, in truth, my lord;<br>
Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:<br>
My lady, to the manner of the days,<br>
In courtesy gives undeserving praise.<br>
We four indeed confronted were with four<br>
In Russian habit: here they stay&#8217;d an hour,<br>
And talk&#8217;d apace; and in that hour, my lord,<br>
They did not bless us with one happy word.<br>
I dare not call them fools; but this I think,<br>
When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,<br>
Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,<br>
With eyes best seeing, heaven&#8217;s fiery eye,<br>
By light we lose light: your capacity<br>
Is of that nature that to your huge store<br>
Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">This proves you wise and rich, for in my
eye,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I am a fool, and full of poverty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">But that you take what doth to you belong,<br>
It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am yours, and all that I possess!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">All the fool mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot give you less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Which of the vizards was it that you wore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Where? when? what vizard? why demand you
this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">There, then, that vizard; that superfluous
case<br>
That hid the worse and show&#8217;d the better face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">We are descried; they&#8217;ll mock us now
downright.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Let us confess and turn it to a jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Help, hold his brows! he&#8217;ll swoon! Why look
you pale?<br>
Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.<br>
Can any face of brass hold longer out?<br>
Here stand I lady, dart thy skill at me;<br>
Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;<br>
Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;<br>
Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;<br>
And I will wish thee never more to dance,<br>
Nor never more in Russian habit wait.<br>
O, never will I trust to speeches penn&#8217;d,<br>
Nor to the motion of a schoolboy&#8217;s tongue,<br>
Nor never come in vizard to my friend,<br>
Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper&#8217;s song!<br>
Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,<br>
Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,<br>
Figures pedantical; these summer-flies<br>
Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:<br>
I do forswear them; and I here protest,<br>
By this white glove;&#8212;how white the hand, God
knows!&#8212;<br>
Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express&#8217;d<br>
In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:<br>
And, to begin, wench,&#8212;so God help me, la!&#8212;<br>
My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Sans sans, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Yet I have a trick<br>
Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;<br>
I&#8217;ll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:<br>
Write, &#8216;Lord have mercy on us&#8217; on those three;<br>
They are infected; in their hearts it lies;<br>
They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;<br>
These lords are visited; you are not free,<br>
For the Lord&#8217;s tokens on you do I see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">No, they are free that gave these tokens to
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">It is not so; for how can this be true,<br>
That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! for I will not have to do with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude
transgression<br>
Some fair excuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The fairest is confession.<br>
Were not you here but even now disguised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And were you well advised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I was, fair madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;When you then were here,<br>
What did you whisper in your lady&#8217;s ear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">That more than all the world I did respect
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">When she shall challenge this, you will reject
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace! forbear:<br>
Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,<br>
What did the Russian whisper in your ear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear<br>
As precious eyesight, and did value me<br>
Above this world; adding thereto moreover<br>

Most honourably doth unhold his word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,<br>
I never swore this lady such an oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,<br>
You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">My faith and this the princess I did give:<br>
I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;<br>
And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.<br>
What, will you have me, or your pearl again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Neither of either; I remit both twain.<br>
I see the trick on&#8217;t: here was a consent,<br>
Knowing aforehand of our merriment,<br>
To dash it like a Christmas comedy:<br>
Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,<br>
Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,<br>
That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick<br>
To make my lady laugh when she&#8217;s disposed,<br>
Told our intents before; which once disclosed,<br>
The ladies did change favours: and then we,<br>
Following the signs, woo&#8217;d but the sign of she.<br>
Now, to our perjury to add more terror,<br>
We are again forsworn, in will and error.<br>
Much upon this it is: and might not you</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speech">Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?<br>
Do not you know my lady&#8217;s foot by the squier,<br>
And laugh upon the apple of her eye?<br>
And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,<br>
Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?<br>
You put our page out: go, you are allow&#8217;d;<br>
Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.<br>
You leer upon me, do you? there&#8217;s an eye<br>
Wounds like a leaden sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Full merrily<br>
Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have
done.</p>

<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, they would know<br>
Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">What, are there but three?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir; but it is vara fine,<br>
For every one pursents three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">And three times thrice is nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is
not so.
You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
what we know:
I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Is not nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth
amount.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your
living
by reckoning, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">How much is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the
actors,
sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou one of the Worthies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Costard</p>
<p class="speech">It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion
the
Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Go, bid them prepare.</p>

some care.</p>

approach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some
policy<br>
To have one show worse than the king&#8217;s and his company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I say they shall not come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, my good lord, let me o&#8217;errule you
now:<br>
That sport best pleases that doth least know how:<br>
Where zeal strives to content, and the contents<br>
Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:<br>
Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,<br>
When great things labouring perish in their birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>

<p class="speech">He speaks not like a man of God&#8217;s
making.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch;

I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we

I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!</p>

Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado&#8217;s page,
Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus:<br>
And if these four Worthies in their first show thrive,<br>
These four will change habits, and present the other five.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">There is five in the first show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,<br>
Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe<br>
In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide<br>
The liberal opposition of our spirits,<br>
If over-boldly we have borne ourselves<br>
In the converse of breath: your gentleness<br>
Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!<br>
A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:<br>
Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks<br>
For my great suit so easily obtain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

All causes to the purpose of his speed,<br>
And often at his very loose decides<br>
That which long process could not arbitrate:<br>
And though the mourning brow of progeny<br>
Forbid the smiling courtesy of love<br>
The holy suit which fain it would convince,<br>
Yet, since love&#8217;s argument was first on foot,<br>
Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it<br>
From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost<br>
Is not by much so wholesome-profitable<br>
As to rejoice at friends but newly found.</p>

And by these badges understand the king.<br>
For your fair sakes have we neglected time,<br>
Play&#8217;d foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,<br>
Hath much deform&#8217;d us, fashioning our humours<br>
Even to the opposed end of our intents:<br>
And what in us hath seem&#8217;d ridiculous,&#8212;<br>
As love is full of unbefitting strains,<br>
All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,<br>
Form&#8217;d by the eye and therefore, like the eye,<br>
Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,<br>
Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll<br>
To every varied object in his glance:<br>
Which parti-coated presence of loose love<br>
Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,<br>
Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,<br>
Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,<br>
Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,<br>
Our love being yours, the error that love makes<br>
Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,<br>
By being once false for ever to be true<br>
To those that make us both,&#8212;fair ladies, you:<br>
And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,<br>
Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We have received your letters full of love;<br>
Your favours, the ambassadors of love;<br>
And, in our maiden council, rated them<br>
At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,<br>
As bombast and as lining to the time:<br>
But more devout than this in our respects<br>
Have we not been; and therefore met your loves<br>
In their own fashion, like a merriment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Our letters, madam, show&#8217;d much more than
jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">So did our looks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We did not quote them so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Now, at the latest minute of the hour,<br>
Grant us your loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">A time, methinks, too short<br>
To make a world-without-end bargain in.<br>
No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,<br>
Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:<br>
If for my love, as there is no such cause,<br>
You will do aught, this shall you do for me:<br>
Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed<br>
To some forlorn and naked hermitage,<br>
Remote from all the pleasures of the world;<br>
There stay until the twelve celestial signs<br>
Have brought about the annual reckoning.<br>
If this austere insociable life<br>
Change not your offer made in heat of blood;<br>
If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds<br>
Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,<br>
But that it bear this trial and last love;<br>
Then, at the expiration of the year,<br>
Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,<br>
And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine<br>
I will be thine; and till that instant shut<br>
My woeful self up in a mourning house,<br>
Raining the tears of lamentation<br>
For the remembrance of my father&#8217;s death.<br>
If this thou do deny, let our hands part,<br>
Neither entitled in the other&#8217;s heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">If this, or more than this, I would deny,<br>
To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,<br>
The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!<br>
Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">But what to me, my love? but what to me? A
wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">A beard, fair health, and honesty;<br>
With three-fold love I wish you all these three.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day<br>
I&#8217;ll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:<br>
Come when the king doth to my lady come;<br>
Then, if I have much love, I&#8217;ll give you some.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll serve thee true and faithfully till
then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">What says Maria?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At the twelvemonth&#8217;s end<br>
I&#8217;ll change my black gown for a faithful friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll stay with patience; but the time is
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">The liker you; few taller are so young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;<br>
Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,<br>
What humble suit attends thy answer there:<br>
Impose some service on me for thy love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,<br>
Before I saw you; and the world&#8217;s large tongue<br>
Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,<br>
Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,<br>
Which you on all estates will execute<br>
That lie within the mercy of your wit.<br>
To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,<br>
And therewithal to win me, if you please,<br>
Without the which I am not to be won,<br>
You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day<br>
Visit the speechless sick and still converse<br>
With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,<br>
With all the fierce endeavor of your wit<br>
To enforce the pained impotent to smile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">To move wild laughter in the throat of death?<br>
It cannot be; it is impossible:<br>
Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s the way to choke a gibing
spirit,<br>
Whose influence is begot of that loose grace<br>
Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:<br>
A jest&#8217;s prosperity lies in the ear<br>
Of him that hears it, never in the tongue<br>
Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,<br>
Deaf&#8217;d with the clamours of their own dear groans,<br>
Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,<br>
And I will have you and that fault withal;<br>
But if they will not, throw away that spirit,<br>
And I shall find you empty of that fault,<br>
Right joyful of your reformation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,<br>
I&#8217;ll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Ferdinand]</span> Ay,
sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam; we will bring you on your way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Our wooing doth not end like an old play;<br>
Jack hath not Jill: these ladies&#8217; courtesy<br>
Might well have made our sport a comedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,<br>
And then &#8217;twill end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s too long for a play.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Don Adriano De
Armado</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Was not that Hector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">The worthy knight of Troy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I
am
a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
end of our show.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Call them forth quickly; we will do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">Holla! approach.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Holofernes, Sir
Nathaniel, Moth, Costard, and others</span></p>
<p class="speech">This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the
Spring;
the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
cuckoo. Ver, begin.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Song</span></p>
<p class="speech verse">Spring.<br>
When daisies pied and violets blue<br>
And lady-smocks all silver-white<br>
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue<br>
Do paint the meadows with delight,<br>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<br>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;<br>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<br>
Unpleasing to a married ear!<br>
When shepherds pipe on oaten straws<br>
And merry larks are ploughmen&#8217;s clocks,<br>
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,<br>
And maidens bleach their summer smocks<br>
The cuckoo then, on every tree,<br>
Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;<br>
Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,<br>
Unpleasing to a married ear!</p>
<p class="speech verse">
Winter.<br>
When icicles hang by the wall<br>
And Dick the shepherd blows his nail<br>
And Tom bears logs into the hall<br>
And milk comes frozen home in pail,<br>
When blood is nipp&#8217;d and ways be foul,<br>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;<br>
Tu-who, a merry note,<br>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.<br>
When all aloud the wind doth blow<br>
And coughing drowns the parson&#8217;s saw<br>
And birds sit brooding in the snow<br>
And Marian&#8217;s nose looks red and raw,<br>
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,<br>
Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;<br>
Tu-who, a merry note,<br>
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Adriano de Armado</p>
<p class="speech">The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs
of<br>
Apollo. You that way: we this way.</p>
