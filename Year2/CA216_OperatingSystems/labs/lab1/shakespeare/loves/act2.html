<h4>Scene I. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Princess of France,
Rosaline, Maria, Katharine, Boyet, Lords, and other
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:<br>
Consider who the king your father sends,<br>
To whom he sends, and what&#8217;s his embassy:<br>
Yourself, held precious in the world&#8217;s esteem,<br>
To parley with the sole inheritor<br>
Of all perfections that a man may owe,<br>
Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight<br>
Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.<br>
Be now as prodigal of all dear grace<br>
As Nature was in making graces dear<br>
When she did starve the general world beside<br>
And prodigally gave them all to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,<br>
Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:<br>
Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,<br>
Not utter&#8217;d by base sale of chapmen&#8217;s tongues:<br>
I am less proud to hear you tell my worth<br>
Than you much willing to be counted wise<br>
In spending your wit in the praise of mine.<br>
But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,<br>
You are not ignorant, all-telling fame<br>
Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,<br>
Till painful study shall outwear three years,<br>
No woman may approach his silent court:<br>
Therefore to&#8217;s seemeth it a needful course,<br>
Before we enter his forbidden gates,<br>
To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,<br>
Bold of your worthiness, we single you<br>
As our best-moving fair solicitor.<br>
Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,<br>
On serious business, craving quick dispatch,<br>
Importunes personal conference with his grace:<br>
Haste, signify so much; while we attend,<br>
Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Proud of employment, willingly I go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speech">Who are the votaries, my loving lords,<br>
That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Longaville is one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Know you the man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,<br>
Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir<br>
Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized<br>
In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:<br>
A man of sovereign parts he is esteem&#8217;d;<br>
Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:<br>
Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.<br>
The only soil of his fair virtue&#8217;s gloss,<br>
If virtue&#8217;s gloss will stain with any soil,<br>
Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;<br>
Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills<br>
It should none spare that come within his power.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Some merry mocking lord, belike; is&#8217;t
so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">They say so most that most his humours know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.<br>
Who are the rest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,<br>
Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:<br>
Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;<br>
For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,<br>
And shape to win grace though he had no wit.<br>
I saw him at the Duke Alencon&#8217;s once;<br>
And much too little of that good I saw<br>
Is my report to his great worthiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Another of these students at that time<br>
Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.<br>
Biron they call him; but a merrier man,<br>
Within the limit of becoming mirth,<br>
I never spent an hour&#8217;s talk withal:<br>
His eye begets occasion for his wit;<br>
For every object that the one doth catch<br>
The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,<br>
Which his fair tongue, conceit&#8217;s expositor,<br>
Delivers in such apt and gracious words<br>
That aged ears play truant at his tales<br>
And younger hearings are quite ravished;<br>
So sweet and voluble is his discourse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">God bless my ladies! are they all in love,<br>
That every one her own hath garnished<br>
With such bedecking ornaments of praise?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Boyet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Boyet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Now, what admittance, lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Navarre had notice of your fair approach;<br>
And he and his competitors in oath<br>
Were all address&#8217;d to meet you, gentle lady,<br>
Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:<br>
He rather means to lodge you in the field,<br>
Like one that comes here to besiege his court,<br>
Than seek a dispensation for his oath,<br>
To let you enter his unpeopled house.<br>
Here comes Navarre.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ferdinand, Longaville,
Dumain, Biron, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Fair princess, welcome to the court of
Navarre.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Fair&#8217; I give you back again; and
&#8216;welcome&#8217; I have
not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Our Lady help my lord! he&#8217;ll be
forsworn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Why, will shall break it; will and nothing
else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,<br>
Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.<br>
I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:<br>
Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,<br>
And sin to break it.<br>
But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:<br>
To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.<br>
Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,<br>
And suddenly resolve me in my suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">You will the sooner, that I were away;<br>
For you&#8217;ll prove perjured if you make me stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I know you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">How needless was it then to ask the question!</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">You must not be so quick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis &#8217;long of you that spur me with
such questions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Your wit&#8217;s too hot, it speeds too fast,
&#8217;twill tire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Not till it leave the rider in the mire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">What time o&#8217; day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">The hour that fools should ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Now fair befall your mask!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Fair fall the face it covers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">And send you many lovers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, so you be none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then will I be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, your father here doth intimate<br>
The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;<br>
Being but the one half of an entire sum<br>
Disbursed by my father in his wars.<br>
But say that he or we, as neither have,<br>
Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid<br>
A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,<br>
One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,<br>
Although not valued to the money&#8217;s worth.<br>
If then the king your father will restore<br>
But that one half which is unsatisfied,<br>
We will give up our right in Aquitaine,<br>
And hold fair friendship with his majesty.<br>
But that, it seems, he little purposeth,<br>
For here he doth demand to have repaid<br>
A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,<br>
On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,<br>
To have his title live in Aquitaine;<br>
Which we much rather had depart withal<br>
And have the money by our father lent<br>
Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.<br>
Dear Princess, were not his requests so far<br>
From reason&#8217;s yielding, your fair self should make<br>
A yielding &#8217;gainst some reason in my breast<br>
And go well satisfied to France again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">You do the king my father too much wrong<br>
And wrong the reputation of your name,<br>
In so unseeming to confess receipt<br>
Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">I do protest I never heard of it;<br>
And if you prove it, I&#8217;ll repay it back<br>
Or yield up Aquitaine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">We arrest your word.<br>
Boyet, you can produce acquittances<br>
For such a sum from special officers<br>
Of Charles his father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Satisfy me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">So please your grace, the packet is not come<br>
Where that and other specialties are bound:<br>
To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">It shall suffice me: at which interview<br>
All liberal reason I will yield unto.<br>
Meantime receive such welcome at my hand<br>
As honour without breach of honour may<br>
Make tender of to thy true worthiness:<br>
You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;<br>
But here without you shall be so received<br>
As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,<br>
Though so denied fair harbour in my house.<br>
Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:<br>
To-morrow shall we visit you again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet health and fair desires consort your
grace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to
see it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I would you heard it groan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Is the fool sick?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Sick at the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, let it blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Would that do it good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">My physic says &#8216;ay.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Will you prick&#8217;t with your eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">No point, with my knife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Now, God save thy life!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">And yours from long living!</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot stay thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Retiring</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that
same?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dumain</p>
<p class="speech">A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you a word: what is she in the
white?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the
light.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance light in the light. I desire her
name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">She hath but one for herself; to desire that were
a shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, sir, whose daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Her mother&#8217;s, I have heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s blessing on your beard!</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, be not offended.<br>
She is an heir of Falconbridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Longaville</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, my choler is ended.<br>
She is a most sweet lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Not unlike, sir, that may be.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Longaville</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s her name in the cap?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Rosaline, by good hap.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">Is she wedded or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">To her will, sir, or so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biron</p>
<p class="speech">You are welcome, sir: adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Biron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:<br>
Not a word with him but a jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">And every jest but a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">It was well done of you to take him at his
word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">I was as willing to grapple as he was to
board.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Two hot sheeps, marry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">And wherefore not ships?<br>
No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the
jest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">So you grant pasture for me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Offering to kiss
her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, gentle beast:<br>
My lips are no common, though several they be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Belonging to whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;To my fortunes and me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles,
agree:<br>
This civil war of wits were much better used<br>
On Navarre and his book-men; for here &#8217;tis abused.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">If my observation, which very seldom lies,<br>
By the heart&#8217;s still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,<br>
Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">With what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">With that which we lovers entitle affected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, all his behaviors did make their retire<br>
To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:<br>
His heart, like an agate, with your print impress&#8217;d,<br>
Proud with his form, in his eye pride express&#8217;d:<br>
His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,<br>
Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;<br>
All senses to that sense did make their repair,<br>
To feel only looking on fairest of fair:<br>
Methought all his senses were lock&#8217;d in his eye,<br>
As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;<br>
Who, tendering their own worth from where they were
glass&#8217;d,<br>
Did point you to buy them, along as you pass&#8217;d:<br>
His face&#8217;s own margent did quote such amazes<br>
That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.<br>
I&#8217;ll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,<br>
An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Princess</p>
<p class="speech">Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">But to speak that in words which his eye hath
disclosed.<br>
I only have made a mouth of his eye,<br>
By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art an old love-monger and speakest
skilfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">He is Cupid&#8217;s grandfather and learns news
of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is
but grim.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear, my mad wenches?</p>
<p class="speaker">Maria</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">What then, do you see?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosaline</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, our way to be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boyet</p>
<p class="speech">You are too hard for me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
