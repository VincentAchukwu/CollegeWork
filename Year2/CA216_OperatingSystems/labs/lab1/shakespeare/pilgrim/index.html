<div id="section1" class="section" title="I.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section1">I.</a></h4>
<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth,<br>
I do believe her, though I know she lies,<br>
That she might think me some untutor&#8217;d youth,<br>
Unskilful in the world&#8217;s false forgeries,<br>
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,<br>
Although I know my years be past the best,<br>
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,<br>
Outfacing faults in love with love&#8217;s ill rest.<br>
But wherefore says my love that she is young?<br>
And wherefore say not I that I am old?<br>
O, love&#8217;s best habit is a soothing tongue,<br>
And age, in love, loves not to have years told.<br>
&#8195;Therefore, I&#8217;ll lie with love, and love with me,<br>
&#8195;Since that our faults in love thus smother&#8217;d be.</p>
</div>
<div id="section2" class="section" title="II.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section2">II.</a></h4>
<p>Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,<br>
That like two spirits do suggest me still;<br>
My better angel is a man right fair,<br>
My worser spirit a woman colour&#8217;d ill.<br>
To win me soon to hell, my female evil<br>
Tempteth my better angel from my side,<br>
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,<br>
Wooing his purity with her fair pride.<br>
And whether that my angel be turn&#8217;d fiend,<br>
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell:<br>
For being both to me, both to each friend,<br>
I guess one angel in another&#8217;s hell:<br>
&#8195;The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,<br>
&#8195;Till my bad angel fire my good one out.</p>
</div>
<div id="section3" class="section" title="III.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section3">III.</a></h4>
<p>Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,<br>
&#8216;Gainst whom the world could not hold argument.<br>
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?<br>
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.<br>
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,<br>
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:<br>
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love:<br>
Thy grace being gain&#8217;d cures all disgrace in me.<br>
My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;<br>
Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,<br>
Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:<br>
If broken, then it is no fault of mine.<br>
&#8195;If by me broke, what fool is not so wise<br>
&#8195;To break an oath, to win a paradise?</p>
</div>
<div id="section4" class="section" title="IV.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section4">IV.</a></h4>
<p>Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook<br>
With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,<br>
Did court the lad with many a lovely look,<br>
Such looks as none could look but beauty&#8217;s queen,<br>
She told him stories to delight his ear;<br>
She show&#8217;d him favours to allure his eye;<br>
To win his heart, she touch&#8217;d him here and there, &#8212;<br>
Touches so soft still conquer chastity.<br>
But whether unripe years did want conceit,<br>
Or he refused to take her figured proffer,<br>
The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,<br>
But smile and jest at every gentle offer:<br>
&#8195;Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:<br>
&#8195;He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!</p>
</div>
<div id="section5" class="section" title="V.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section5">V.</a></h4>
<p>If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?<br>
O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow&#8217;d:<br>
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I&#8217;ll constant prove;<br>
Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers
bow&#8217;d.<br>
Study his bias leaves, and make his book thine eyes,<br>
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.<br>
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;<br>
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;<br>
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;<br>
Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire:<br>
Thy eye Jove&#8217;s lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful
thunder,<br>
Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.<br>
&#8195;Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,<br>
&#8195;To sing heaven&#8217;s praise with such an earthly
tongue.</p>
</div>
<div id="section6" class="section" title="VI.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section6">VI.</a></h4>
<p>Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,<br>
And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,<br>
When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,<br>
A longing tarriance for Adonis made<br>
Under an osier growing by a brook,<br>
A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen:<br>
Hot was the day; she hotter that did look<br>
For his approach, that often there had been.<br>
Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,<br>
And stood stark naked on the brook&#8217;s green brim:<br>
The sun look&#8217;d on the world with glorious eye,<br>
Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.<br>
&#8195;He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:<br>
&#8195;&#8216;O Jove,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;why was not I a
flood!&#8217;</p>
</div>
<div id="section7" class="section" title="VII.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section7">VII.</a></h4>
<p>Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;<br>
Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;<br>
Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is brittle;<br>
Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:<br>
&#8195;A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,<br>
&#8195;None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.</p>
<p>Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,<br>
Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!<br>
How many tales to please me bath she coined,<br>
Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!<br>
&#8195;Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,<br>
&#8195;Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.</p>
<p>She burn&#8217;d with love, as straw with fire flameth;<br>
She burn&#8217;d out love, as soon as straw outburneth;<br>
She framed the love, and yet she foil&#8217;d the framing;<br>
She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.<br>
&#8195;Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?<br>
&#8195;Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.</p>
</div>
<div id="section8" class="section" title="VIII.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section8">VIII.</a></h4>
<p>If music and sweet poetry agree,<br>
As they must needs, the sister and the brother,<br>
Then must the love be great &#8216;twixt thee and me,<br>
Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.<br>
Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch<br>
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;<br>
Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such<br>
As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.<br>
Thou lovest to bear the sweet melodious sound<br>
That Phoebus&#8217; lute, the queen of music, makes;<br>
And I in deep delight am chiefly drown&#8217;d<br>
Whenas himself to singing he betakes.<br>
&#8195;One god is god of both, as poets feign;<br>
&#8195;One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.</p>
</div>
<div id="section9" class="section" title="IX.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section9">IX.</a></h4>
<p>Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,<br>
&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;.&#8195;&#8195;.<br>

Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,<br>
For Adon&#8217;s sake, a youngster proud and wild;<br>
Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:<br>
Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;<br>
She, silly queen, with more than love&#8217;s good will,<br>
Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:<br>
&#8216;Once,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;did I see a fair sweet
youth<br>
Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,<br>
Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!<br>
See, in my thigh,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;here was the sore.<br>
&#8195;She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,<br>
&#8195;And blushing fled, and left her all alone.</p>
</div>
<div id="section10" class="section" title="X.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section10">X.</a></h4>
<p>Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck&#8217;d, soon vaded,<br>
Pluck&#8217;d in the bud, and vaded in the spring!<br>
Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!<br>
Fair creature, kill&#8217;d too soon by death&#8217;s sharp
sting!<br>
&#8195;Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,<br>
&#8195;And falls, through wind, before the fall should he.</p>
<p>I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;<br>
For why thou left&#8217;st me nothing in thy will:<br>
And yet thou left&#8217;st me more than I did crave;<br>
For why I craved nothing of thee still:<br>
&#8195;O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,<br>
&#8195;Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.</p>
</div>
<div id="section11" class="section" title="XI.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section11">XI.</a></h4>
<p>Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her<br>
Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him:<br>
She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,<br>
And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.<br>
&#8216;Even thus,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;the warlike god embraced
me,&#8217;<br>
And then she clipp&#8217;d Adonis in her arms;<br>
&#8216;Even thus,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;the warlike god unlaced
me,&#8217;<br>
As if the boy should use like loving charms;<br>
&#8216;Even thus,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;he seized on my lips<br>
And with her lips on his did act the seizure<br>
And as she fetched breath, away he skips,<br>
And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.<br>
&#8195;Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,<br>
&#8195;To kiss and clip me till I run away!</p>
</div>
<div id="section12" class="section" title="XII.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section12">XII.</a></h4>
<p>Crabbed age and youth cannot live together<br>
Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;<br>
Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather;<br>
Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare;<br>
Youth is full of sport, age&#8217;s breath is short;<br>
&#8195;Youth is nimble, age is lame;<br>
Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;<br>
&#8195;Youth is wild, and age is tame.<br>
Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;<br>
&#8195;O, my love, my love is young!<br>
Age, I do defy thee: O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,<br>
&#8195;For methinks thou stay&#8217;st too long.</p>

<div id="section13" class="section" title="XIII.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section13">XIII.</a></h4>
<p>Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;<br>
A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;<br>
A flower that dies when first it gins to bud;<br>
A brittle glass that&#8217;s broken presently:<br>
&#8195;A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,<br>
&#8195;Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.</p>
<p>And as goods lost are seld or never found,<br>
As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,<br>
As flowers dead lie wither&#8217;d on the ground,<br>
As broken glass no cement can redress,<br>
&#8195;So beauty blemish&#8217;d once&#8217;s for ever lost,<br>
&#8195;In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.</p>
</div>
<div id="section14" class="section" title="XIV.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section14">XIV.</a></h4>
<p>Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:<br>
She bade good night that kept my rest away;<br>
And daff&#8217;d me to a cabin hang&#8217;d with care,<br>
To descant on the doubts of my decay.<br>
&#8216;Farewell,&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;and come again
tomorrow:<br>
Fare well I could not, for I supp&#8217;d with sorrow.</p>
<p>Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,<br>
In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:<br>
&#8216;T may be, she joy&#8217;d to jest at my exile,<br>
&#8216;T may be, again to make me wander thither:<br>
&#8195;&#8216;Wander,&#8217; a word for shadows like myself,<br>
&#8195;As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.</p>
</div>
<div id="section15" class="section" title="XV.">
<h4><a class="bm" href="#section15">XV.</a></h4>
<p>Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!<br>
My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise<br>
Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.<br>
Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,<br>
&#8195;While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,<br>
&#8195;And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;</p>
<p>For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,<br>
And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:<br>
The night so pack&#8217;d, I post unto my pretty;<br>
Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;<br>
&#8195;Sorrow changed to solace, solace mix&#8217;d with
sorrow;<br>
&#8195;For why, she sigh&#8217;d and bade me come tomorrow.</p>
<p>Were I with her, the night would post too soon;<br>
But now are minutes added to the hours;<br>
To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;<br>
Yet not for me, shine sun to succour flowers!<br>
&#8195;Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:<br>
&#8195;Short, night, to-night, and length thyself to-morrow.</p>
