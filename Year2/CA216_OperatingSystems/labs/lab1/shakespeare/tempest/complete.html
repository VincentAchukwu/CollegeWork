Boatswain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Master</p>
<p class="speech">Boatswain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">Here, master: what cheer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Master</p>
<p class="speech">Good, speak to the mariners: fall to&#8217;t,
yarely,
or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mariners</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my
hearts!
yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
master&#8217;s whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
if room enough!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alonso, Sebastian,
Antonio, Ferdinand, Gonzalo, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Good boatswain, have care. Where&#8217;s the
master?<br>
Play the men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">I pray now, keep below.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the master, boatswain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep
your
cabins: you do assist the storm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good, be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">When the sea is. Hence! What cares these
roarers
for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">None that I more love than myself. You are a
counsellor; if you can command these elements to
silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
of our way, I say.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks
he
hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
born to be hanged, our case is miserable.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>

Bring
her to try with main-course.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A cry within</span></p>
<p class="speech">A plague upon this howling! they are louder
than
the weather or our office.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Sebastian, Antonio,
and Gonzalo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give
o&#8217;er
and drown? Have you a mind to sink?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A pox o&#8217; your throat, you bawling,
blasphemous,
incharitable dog!</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">Work you then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent
noisemaker!<br>
We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll warrant him for drowning; though the
ship were
no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
unstanched wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off
to
sea again; lay her off.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mariners wet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mariners</p>
<p class="speech">All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">What, must our mouths be cold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">The king and prince at prayers! let&#8217;s
assist them,<br>
For our case is as theirs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;m out of patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">We are merely cheated of our lives by
drunkards:<br>
This wide-chapp&#8217;d rascal&#8212;would thou mightst lie
drowning<br>
The washing of ten tides!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll be hang&#8217;d yet,<br>
Though every drop of water swear against it<br>
And gape at widest to glut him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A confused noise within:
&#8216;Mercy on us!&#8217;&#8212; &#8216;We split, we
split!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;Farewell, my wife and
children!&#8217;&#8212; &#8216;Farewell,
brother!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;We split, we split, we
split!&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s all sink with the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s take leave of him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Antonio and
Sebastian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for
an
acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
die a dry death.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The island. Before Prospero&#8217;s cell.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prospero and
Miranda</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">If by your art, my dearest father, you have<br>
Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.<br>
The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,<br>
But that the sea, mounting to the welkin&#8217;s cheek,<br>
Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered<br>
With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,<br>
Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,<br>
Dash&#8217;d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock<br>
Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish&#8217;d.<br>
Had I been any god of power, I would<br>
Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere<br>
It should the good ship so have swallow&#8217;d and<br>
The fraughting souls within her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Be collected:<br>
No more amazement: tell your piteous heart<br>
There&#8217;s no harm done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O, woe the day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">No harm.<br>
I have done nothing but in care of thee,<br>
Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who<br>
Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing<br>
Of whence I am, nor that I am more better<br>
Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,<br>
And thy no greater father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">More to know<br>
Did never meddle with my thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis time<br>
I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,<br>
And pluck my magic garment from me. So:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lays down his
mantle</span></p>
<p class="speech">Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have
comfort.<br>
The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch&#8217;d<br>
The very virtue of compassion in thee,<br>
I have with such provision in mine art<br>
So safely ordered that there is no soul&#8212;<br>
No, not so much perdition as an hair<br>
Betid to any creature in the vessel<br>
Which thou heard&#8217;st cry, which thou saw&#8217;st sink. Sit
down;<br>
For thou must now know farther.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">You have often<br>
Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp&#8217;d<br>
And left me to a bootless inquisition,<br>
Concluding &#8216;stay: not yet.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">The hour&#8217;s now come;<br>
The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;<br>
Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember<br>
A time before we came unto this cell?<br>
I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not<br>
Out three years old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Certainly, sir, I can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">By what? by any other house or person?<br>
Of any thing the image tell me that<br>
Hath kept with thy remembrance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis far off<br>
And rather like a dream than an assurance<br>
That my remembrance warrants. Had I not<br>
Four or five women once that tended me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it<br>
That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else<br>
In the dark backward and abysm of time?<br>
If thou remember&#8217;st aught ere thou camest here,<br>
How thou camest here thou mayst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">But that I do not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year
since,<br>
Thy father was the Duke of Milan and<br>
A prince of power.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Sir, are not you my father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and<br>
She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father<br>
Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir<br>
And princess no worse issued.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O the heavens!<br>
What foul play had we, that we came from thence?<br>
Or blessed was&#8217;t we did?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Both, both, my girl:<br>
By foul play, as thou say&#8217;st, were we heaved thence,<br>
But blessedly holp hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O, my heart bleeds<br>
To think o&#8217; the teen that I have turn&#8217;d you to,<br>
Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">My brother and thy uncle, call&#8217;d
Antonio&#8212;<br>
I pray thee, mark me&#8212;that a brother should<br>
Be so perfidious!&#8212;he whom next thyself<br>
Of all the world I loved and to him put<br>
The manage of my state; as at that time<br>
Through all the signories it was the first<br>
And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed<br>
In dignity, and for the liberal arts<br>
Without a parallel; those being all my study,<br>
The government I cast upon my brother<br>
And to my state grew stranger, being transported<br>
And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle&#8212;<br>
Dost thou attend me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, most heedfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Being once perfected how to grant suits,<br>
How to deny them, who to advance and who<br>
To trash for over-topping, new created<br>
The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed &#8217;em,<br>
Or else new form&#8217;d &#8217;em; having both the key<br>
Of officer and office, set all hearts i&#8217; the state<br>
To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was<br>
The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,<br>
And suck&#8217;d my verdure out on&#8217;t. Thou attend&#8217;st
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O, good sir, I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I pray thee, mark me.<br>
I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated<br>
To closeness and the bettering of my mind<br>
With that which, but by being so retired,<br>
O&#8217;er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother<br>
Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,<br>
Like a good parent, did beget of him<br>
A falsehood in its contrary as great<br>
As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,<br>
A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,<br>
Not only with what my revenue yielded,<br>
But what my power might else exact, like one<br>
Who having into truth, by telling of it,<br>
Made such a sinner of his memory,<br>
To credit his own lie, he did believe<br>
He was indeed the duke; out o&#8217; the substitution<br>
And executing the outward face of royalty,<br>
With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing&#8212;<br>
Dost thou hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Your tale, sir, would cure
deafness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">To have no screen between this part he
play&#8217;d<br>
And him he play&#8217;d it for, he needs will be<br>
Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library<br>
Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties<br>
He thinks me now incapable; confederates&#8212;<br>
So dry he was for sway&#8212;wi&#8217; the King of Naples<br>
To give him annual tribute, do him homage,<br>
Subject his coronet to his crown and bend<br>
The dukedom yet unbow&#8217;d&#8212;alas, poor Milan!&#8212;<br>
To most ignoble stooping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O the heavens!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Mark his condition and the event; then tell
me<br>
If this might be a brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">I should sin<br>
To think but nobly of my grandmother:<br>
Good wombs have borne bad sons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Now the condition.<br>
The King of Naples, being an enemy<br>
To me inveterate, hearkens my brother&#8217;s suit;<br>
Which was, that he, in lieu o&#8217; the premises<br>
Of homage and I know not how much tribute,<br>
Should presently extirpate me and mine<br>
Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan<br>
With all the honours on my brother: whereon,<br>
A treacherous army levied, one midnight<br>
Fated to the purpose did Antonio open<br>
The gates of Milan, and, i&#8217; the dead of darkness,<br>
The ministers for the purpose hurried thence<br>
Me and thy crying self.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, for pity!<br>
I, not remembering how I cried out then,<br>
Will cry it o&#8217;er again: it is a hint<br>
That wrings mine eyes to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Hear a little further<br>
And then I&#8217;ll bring thee to the present business<br>
Which now&#8217;s upon&#8217;s; without the which this story<br>
Were most impertinent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore did they not<br>
That hour destroy us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Well demanded, wench:<br>
My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,<br>
So dear the love my people bore me, nor set<br>
A mark so bloody on the business, but<br>
With colours fairer painted their foul ends.<br>
In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,<br>
Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared<br>
A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg&#8217;d,<br>
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats<br>
Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,<br>
To cry to the sea that roar&#8217;d to us, to sigh<br>
To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,<br>
Did us but loving wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, what trouble<br>
Was I then to you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, a cherubim<br>
Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.<br>
Infused with a fortitude from heaven,<br>
When I have deck&#8217;d the sea with drops full salt,<br>
Under my burthen groan&#8217;d; which raised in me<br>
An undergoing stomach, to bear up<br>
Against what should ensue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">How came we ashore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">By Providence divine.<br>
Some food we had and some fresh water that<br>
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,<br>
Out of his charity, being then appointed<br>
Master of this design, did give us, with<br>
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,<br>
Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,<br>
Knowing I loved my books, he furnish&#8217;d me<br>
From mine own library with volumes that<br>
I prize above my dukedom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Would I might<br>
But ever see that man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Now I arise:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Resumes his mantle</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sit still, and hear the last of our
sea-sorrow.<br>
Here in this island we arrived; and here<br>
Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit<br>
Than other princesses can that have more time<br>
For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens thank you for&#8217;t! And now, I pray
you, sir,<br>
For still &#8217;tis beating in my mind, your reason<br>
For raising this sea-storm?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Know thus far forth.<br>
By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,<br>
Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies<br>
Brought to this shore; and by my prescience<br>
I find my zenith doth depend upon<br>
A most auspicious star, whose influence<br>
If now I court not but omit, my fortunes<br>
Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:<br>
Thou art inclined to sleep; &#8217;tis a good dulness,<br>
And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Miranda sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.<br>
Approach, my Ariel, come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I
come<br>
To answer thy best pleasure; be&#8217;t to fly,<br>
To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride<br>
On the curl&#8217;d clouds, to thy strong bidding task<br>
Ariel and all his quality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou, spirit,<br>
Perform&#8217;d to point the tempest that I bade thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">To every article.<br>
I boarded the king&#8217;s ship; now on the beak,<br>
Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,<br>
I flamed amazement: sometime I&#8217;ld divide,<br>
And burn in many places; on the topmast,<br>
The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,<br>
Then meet and join. Jove&#8217;s lightnings, the precursors<br>
O&#8217; the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary<br>
And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks<br>
Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune<br>
Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,<br>
Yea, his dread trident shake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">My brave spirit!<br>
Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil<br>
Would not infect his reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Not a soul<br>
But felt a fever of the mad and play&#8217;d<br>
Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners<br>
Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,<br>
Then all afire with me: the king&#8217;s son, Ferdinand,<br>
With hair up-staring,&#8212;then like reeds, not hair,&#8212;<br>
Was the first man that leap&#8217;d; cried, &#8216;Hell is
empty<br>
And all the devils are here.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Why that&#8217;s my spirit!<br>
But was not this nigh shore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Close by, my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">But are they, Ariel, safe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Not a hair perish&#8217;d;<br>
On their sustaining garments not a blemish,<br>
But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,<br>
In troops I have dispersed them &#8217;bout the isle.<br>
The king&#8217;s son have I landed by himself;<br>
Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs<br>
In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,<br>
His arms in this sad knot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Of the king&#8217;s ship<br>
The mariners say how thou hast disposed<br>
And all the rest o&#8217; the fleet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Safely in harbour<br>
Is the king&#8217;s ship; in the deep nook, where once<br>
Thou call&#8217;dst me up at midnight to fetch dew<br>
From the still-vex&#8217;d Bermoothes, there she&#8217;s hid:<br>
The mariners all under hatches stow&#8217;d;<br>
Who, with a charm join&#8217;d to their suffer&#8217;d labour,<br>
I have left asleep; and for the rest o&#8217; the fleet<br>
Which I dispersed, they all have met again<br>
And are upon the Mediterranean flote,<br>
Bound sadly home for Naples,<br>
Supposing that they saw the king&#8217;s ship wreck&#8217;d<br>
And his great person perish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Ariel, thy charge<br>
Exactly is perform&#8217;d: but there&#8217;s more work.<br>
What is the time o&#8217; the day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Past the mid season.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">At least two glasses. The time &#8217;twixt six
and now<br>
Must by us both be spent most preciously.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me
pains,<br>
Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,<br>
Which is not yet perform&#8217;d me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">How now? moody?<br>
What is&#8217;t thou canst demand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">My liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Before the time be out? no more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee,<br>
Remember I have done thee worthy service;<br>
Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served<br>
Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise<br>
To bate me a full year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou forget<br>
From what a torment I did free thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost, and think&#8217;st it much to tread
the ooze<br>
Of the salt deep,<br>
To run upon the sharp wind of the north,<br>
To do me business in the veins o&#8217; the earth<br>
When it is baked with frost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I do not, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot<br>
The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy<br>
Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou hast. Where was she born?
speak; tell me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, in Argier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, was she so? I must<br>
Once in a month recount what thou hast been,<br>
Which thou forget&#8217;st. This damn&#8217;d witch Sycorax,<br>
For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible<br>
To enter human hearing, from Argier,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st, was banish&#8217;d: for one thing she did<br>
They would not take her life. Is not this true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with
child<br>
And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,<br>
As thou report&#8217;st thyself, wast then her servant;<br>
And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate<br>
To act her earthy and abhorr&#8217;d commands,<br>
Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,<br>
By help of her more potent ministers<br>
And in her most unmitigable rage,<br>
Into a cloven pine; within which rift<br>
Imprison&#8217;d thou didst painfully remain<br>
A dozen years; within which space she died<br>
And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans<br>
As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island&#8212;<br>
Save for the son that she did litter here,<br>
A freckled whelp hag-born&#8212;not honour&#8217;d with<br>
A human shape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yes, Caliban her son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban<br>
Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know&#8217;st<br>
What torment I did find thee in; thy groans<br>
Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts<br>
Of ever angry bears: it was a torment<br>
To lay upon the damn&#8217;d, which Sycorax<br>
Could not again undo: it was mine art,<br>
When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape<br>
The pine and let thee out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">If thou more murmur&#8217;st, I will rend an
oak<br>
And peg thee in his knotty entrails till<br>
Thou hast howl&#8217;d away twelve winters.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, master;<br>
I will be correspondent to command<br>
And do my spiriting gently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, and after two days<br>
I will discharge thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s my noble master!<br>
What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Go make thyself like a nymph o&#8217; the sea: be
subject<br>
To no sight but thine and mine, invisible<br>
To every eyeball else. Go take this shape<br>
And hither come in&#8217;t: go, hence with diligence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speech">Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;
Awake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The strangeness of your story
put<br>
Heaviness in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Shake it off. Come on;<br>
We&#8217;ll visit Caliban my slave, who never<br>
Yields us kind answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a villain, sir,<br>
I do not love to look on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">But, as &#8217;tis,<br>
We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,<br>
Fetch in our wood and serves in offices<br>
That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!<br>
Thou earth, thou! speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> There&#8217;s
wood enough within.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Come forth, I say! there&#8217;s other business
for thee:<br>
Come, thou tortoise! when?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel like a
water-nymph</span></p>
<p class="speech">Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,<br>
Hark in thine ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord it shall be done.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil
himself<br>
Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Caliban</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">As wicked dew as e&#8217;er my mother
brush&#8217;d<br>
With raven&#8217;s feather from unwholesome fen<br>
Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye<br>
And blister you all o&#8217;er!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have
cramps,<br>
Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins<br>
Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,<br>
All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch&#8217;d<br>
As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging<br>
Than bees that made &#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I must eat my dinner.<br>
This island&#8217;s mine, by Sycorax my mother,<br>
Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,<br>
Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me<br>
Water with berries in&#8217;t, and teach me how<br>
To name the bigger light, and how the less,<br>
That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee<br>
And show&#8217;d thee all the qualities o&#8217; the isle,<br>
The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:<br>
Cursed be I that did so! All the charms<br>
Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!<br>
For I am all the subjects that you have,<br>
Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me<br>
In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me<br>
The rest o&#8217; the island.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Thou most lying slave,<br>
Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,<br>
Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee<br>
In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate<br>
The honour of my child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">O ho, O ho! would&#8217;t had been done!<br>
Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else<br>
This isle with Calibans.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Abhorred slave,<br>
Which any print of goodness wilt not take,<br>
Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,<br>
Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour<br>
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,<br>
Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like<br>
A thing most brutish, I endow&#8217;d thy purposes<br>
With words that made them known. But thy vile race,<br>
Though thou didst learn, had that in&#8217;t which
good natures<br>
Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou<br>
Deservedly confined into this rock,<br>
Who hadst deserved more than a prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">You taught me language; and my profit
on&#8217;t<br>
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you<br>
For learning me your language!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Hag-seed, hence!<br>
Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou&#8217;rt best,<br>
To answer other business. Shrug&#8217;st thou, malice?<br>
If thou neglect&#8217;st or dost unwillingly<br>
What I command, I&#8217;ll rack thee with old cramps,<br>
Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar<br>
That beasts shall tremble at thy din.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">No, pray thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I must obey: his art is of such power,<br>
It would control my dam&#8217;s god, Setebos,<br>
And make a vassal of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">So, slave; hence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Caliban</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel, invisible,
playing and singing; Ferdinand following</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ariel&#8217;s song.<br>
Come unto these yellow sands,<br>
And then take hands:<br>
Courtsied when you have and kiss&#8217;d<br>
The wild waves whist,<br>
Foot it featly here and there;<br>
And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.<br>
Hark, hark!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Burthen

<p class="speech">The watch-dogs bark!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Burthen Bow-wow</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark, hark! I hear<br>
The strain of strutting chanticleer<br>
Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Where should this music be? i&#8217; the air or
the earth?<br>
It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon<br>
Some god o&#8217; the island. Sitting on a bank,<br>
Weeping again the king my father&#8217;s wreck,<br>
This music crept by me upon the waters,<br>
Allaying both their fury and my passion<br>
With its sweet air: thence I have follow&#8217;d it,<br>
Or it hath drawn me rather. But &#8217;tis gone.<br>
No, it begins again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Ariel sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">Full fathom five thy father lies;<br>
Of his bones are coral made;<br>
Those are pearls that were his eyes:<br>
Nothing of him that doth fade<br>

Into something rich and strange.<br>
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell</p>

<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

father.<br>
This is no mortal business, nor no sound<br>
That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">The fringed curtains of thine eye advance<br>
And say what thou seest yond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t? a spirit?<br>
Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,<br>
It carries a brave form. But &#8217;tis a spirit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such
senses<br>
As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest<br>
Was in the wreck; and, but he&#8217;s something stain&#8217;d<br>
With grief that&#8217;s beauty&#8217;s canker, thou mightst call
him<br>
A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows<br>
And strays about to find &#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">I might call him<br>
A thing divine, for nothing natural<br>
I ever saw so noble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> It goes on, I
see,<br>
As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I&#8217;ll free
thee<br>
Within two days for this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Most sure, the goddess<br>
On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer<br>
May know if you remain upon this island;<br>
And that you will some good instruction give<br>
How I may bear me here: my prime request,<br>
Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!<br>
If you be maid or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">No wonder, sir;<br>
But certainly a maid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

I am the best of them that speak this speech,<br>
Were I but where &#8217;tis spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">How? the best?<br>
What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">A single thing, as I am now, that wonders<br>
To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;<br>
And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,<br>
Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld<br>
The king my father wreck&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, for mercy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of
Milan<br>
And his brave son being twain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> The Duke of
Milan<br>
And his more braver daughter could control thee,<br>
If now &#8217;twere fit to do&#8217;t. At the first sight<br>

I&#8217;ll set thee free for this.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Ferdinand</span></p>
<p class="speech">A word, good sir;<br>
I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Why speaks my father so ungently? This<br>
Is the third man that e&#8217;er I saw, the first<br>
That e&#8217;er I sigh&#8217;d for: pity move my father<br>
To be inclined my way!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">O, if a virgin,<br>
And your affection not gone forth, I&#8217;ll make you<br>
The queen of Naples.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Soft, sir! one word more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">They are both in either&#8217;s powers; but this
swift business<br>
I must uneasy make, lest too light winning<br>
Make the prize light.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Ferdinand</span></p>
<p class="speech">One word more; I charge thee<br>
That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp<br>
The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself<br>
Upon this island as a spy, to win it<br>
From me, the lord on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">No, as I am a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s nothing ill can dwell in such a

If the ill spirit have so fair a house,<br>
Good things will strive to dwell with&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Follow me.<br>
Speak not you for him; he&#8217;s a traitor. Come;<br>
I&#8217;ll manacle thy neck and feet together:<br>
Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be<br>
The fresh-brook muscles, wither&#8217;d roots and husks<br>
Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">No;<br>
I will resist such entertainment till<br>
Mine enemy has more power.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Draws, and is charmed from

<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O dear father,<br>
Make not too rash a trial of him, for<br>

<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">What? I say,<br>
My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;<br>
Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience<br>
Is so possess&#8217;d with guilt: come from thy ward,<br>
For I can here disarm thee with this stick<br>
And make thy weapon drop.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Hence! hang not on my garments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, have pity;<br>
I&#8217;ll be his surety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Silence! one word more<br>

Thou think&#8217;st there is no more such shapes as he,<br>

To the most of men this is a Caliban<br>
And they to him are angels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">My affections<br>

Thy nerves are in their infancy again<br>
And have no vigour in them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">So they are;<br>
My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.<br>
My father&#8217;s loss, the weakness which I feel,<br>
The wreck of all my friends, nor this man&#8217;s threats,<br>
To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,<br>
Might I but through my prison once a day<br>
Behold this maid: all corners else o&#8217; the earth<br>

<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He receives comfort like cold porridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The visitor will not give him o&#8217;er so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Look he&#8217;s winding up the watch of his
wit;
by and by it will strike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">One: tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">When every grief is entertain&#8217;d
that&#8217;s offer&#8217;d,<br>
Comes to the entertainer&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A dollar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
have spoken truer than you purposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">You have taken it wiselier than I meant you
should.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, spare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I have done: but yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He will be talking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
wager, first begins to crow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">The old cock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The cockerel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Done. The wager?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">A laughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A match!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Though this island seem to be desert,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha! So, you&#8217;re paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Yet,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He could not miss&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">It must needs be of subtle, tender and
delicate
temperance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Temperance was a delicate wench.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly
delivered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">As if it had lungs and rotten ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Or as &#8217;twere perfumed by a fen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Here is everything advantageous to life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">True; save means to live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Of that there&#8217;s none, or little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">How lush and lusty the grass looks! how
green!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The ground indeed is tawny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">With an eye of green in&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He misses not much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">But the rarity of it is,&#8212;which is indeed
almost
beyond credit,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">As many vouched rarities are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">That our garments, being, as they were, drenched
in
the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
salt water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">If but one of his pockets could speak, would it
not
say he lies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when
we
put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
the king&#8217;s fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well
in our return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon
to
their queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Not since widow Dido&#8217;s time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Widow! a pox o&#8217; that! How came that widow
in?
widow Dido!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What if he had said &#8216;widower Aeneas&#8217;
too? Good Lord,
how you take it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Widow Dido&#8217; said you? you make me
study of that:
she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adrian</p>
<p class="speech">Carthage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I assure you, Carthage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">His word is more than the miraculous harp; he
hath
raised the wall and houses too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">What impossible matter will he make easy
next?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I think he will carry this island home in his
pocket
and give it his son for an apple.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea,
bring
forth more islands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, in good time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, we were talking that our garments seem
now
as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
of your daughter, who is now queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And the rarest that e&#8217;er came there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day
I
wore it? I mean, in a sort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">That sort was well fished for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">When I wore it at your daughter&#8217;s
marriage?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">You cram these words into mine ears against<br>
The stomach of my sense. Would I had never<br>
Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,<br>
My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,<br>
Who is so far from Italy removed<br>
I ne&#8217;er again shall see her. O thou mine heir<br>
Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish<br>
Hath made his meal on thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Francisco</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, he may live:<br>
I saw him beat the surges under him,<br>
And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,<br>
Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted<br>
The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head<br>
&#8217;Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar&#8217;d<br>
Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke<br>
To the shore, that o&#8217;er his wave-worn basis bow&#8217;d,<br>
As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt<br>
He came alive to land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, he&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you may thank yourself for this great
loss,<br>
That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,<br>
But rather lose her to an African;<br>
Where she at least is banish&#8217;d from your eye,<br>
Who hath cause to wet the grief on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">You were kneel&#8217;d to and importuned
otherwise<br>
By all of us, and the fair soul herself<br>
Weigh&#8217;d between loathness and obedience, at<br>
Which end o&#8217; the beam should bow. We have lost your
son,<br>
I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have<br>
More widows in them of this business&#8217; making<br>
Than we bring men to comfort them:<br>
The fault&#8217;s your own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">So is the dear&#8217;st o&#8217; the loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord Sebastian,<br>
The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness<br>
And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,<br>
When you should bring the plaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And most chirurgeonly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">It is foul weather in us all, good sir,<br>
When you are cloudy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Foul weather?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Very foul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Had I plantation of this isle, my
lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ld sow&#8217;t with nettle-seed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Or docks, or mallows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">And were the king on&#8217;t, what would I
do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Scape being drunk for want of wine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; the commonwealth I would by
contraries<br>
Execute all things; for no kind of traffic<br>
Would I admit; no name of magistrate;<br>
Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,<br>
And use of service, none; contract, succession,<br>
Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;<br>
No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;<br>
No occupation; all men idle, all;<br>
And women too, but innocent and pure;<br>
No sovereignty;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yet he would be king
on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">The latter end of his commonwealth forgets
the
beginning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">All things in common nature should produce<br>
Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,<br>
Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,<br>
Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,<br>
Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,<br>
To feed my innocent people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">No marrying &#8217;mong his subjects?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I would with such perfection govern, sir,<br>
To excel the golden age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">God save his majesty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Long live Gonzalo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And,&#8212;do you mark me, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I do well believe your highness; and
did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
they always use to laugh at nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas you we laughed at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
to you: so you may continue and laugh at
nothing still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">What a blow was there given!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">An it had not fallen flat-long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would
lift
the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
in it five weeks without changing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ariel, invisible,
playing solemn music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good my lord, be not angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
me asleep, for I am very heavy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Go sleep, and hear us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">All sleep except Alonso,
Sebastian, and Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes<br>
Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find<br>
They are inclined to do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, sir,<br>
Do not omit the heavy offer of it:<br>
It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,<br>
It is a comforter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We two, my lord,<br>
Will guard your person while you take your rest,<br>
And watch your safety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Thank you. Wondrous heavy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alonso sleeps. Exit
Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What a strange drowsiness possesses them!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">It is the quality o&#8217; the climate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Why<br>
Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not<br>
Myself disposed to sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I; my spirits are nimble.<br>
They fell together all, as by consent;<br>
They dropp&#8217;d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,<br>
Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?&#8212;No more:&#8212;<br>
And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,<br>
What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and<br>
My strong imagination sees a crown<br>
Dropping upon thy head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou waking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not hear me speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I do; and surely<br>
It is a sleepy language and thou speak&#8217;st<br>
Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?<br>
This is a strange repose, to be asleep<br>
With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,<br>
And yet so fast asleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Sebastian,<br>
Thou let&#8217;st thy fortune sleep&#8212;die, rather;
wink&#8217;st<br>
Whiles thou art waking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost snore distinctly;<br>
There&#8217;s meaning in thy snores.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am more serious than my custom: you<br>
Must be so too, if heed me; which to do<br>
Trebles thee o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Well, I am standing water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll teach you how to flow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Do so: to ebb<br>
Hereditary sloth instructs me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O,<br>
If you but knew how you the purpose cherish<br>
Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,<br>
You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,<br>
Most often do so near the bottom run<br>
By their own fear or sloth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, say on:<br>
The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim<br>
A matter from thee, and a birth indeed<br>
Which throes thee much to yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, sir:<br>
Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,<br>
Who shall be of as little memory<br>
When he is earth&#8217;d, hath here almost persuade,&#8212;<br>
For he&#8217;s a spirit of persuasion, only<br>
Professes to persuade,&#8212;the king his son&#8217;s alive,<br>
&#8217;Tis as impossible that he&#8217;s undrown&#8217;d<br>
And he that sleeps here swims.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I have no hope<br>
That he&#8217;s undrown&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, out of that &#8216;no hope&#8217;<br>
What great hope have you! no hope that way is<br>
Another way so high a hope that even<br>
Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,<br>
But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me<br>
That Ferdinand is drown&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Then, tell me,<br>
Who&#8217;s the next heir of Naples?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Claribel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells<br>
Ten leagues beyond man&#8217;s life; she that from Naples<br>
Can have no note, unless the sun were post&#8212;<br>
The man i&#8217; the moon&#8217;s too slow&#8212;till new-born
chins<br>
Be rough and razorable; she that&#8212;from whom?<br>
We all were sea-swallow&#8217;d, though some cast again,<br>
And by that destiny to perform an act<br>
Whereof what&#8217;s past is prologue, what to come<br>
In yours and my discharge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">What stuff is this! how say you?<br>
&#8217;Tis true, my brother&#8217;s daughter&#8217;s queen of
Tunis;<br>
So is she heir of Naples; &#8217;twixt which regions<br>
There is some space.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">A space whose every cubit<br>
Seems to cry out, &#8216;How shall that Claribel<br>
Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,<br>
And let Sebastian wake.&#8217; Say, this were death<br>
That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse<br>
Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples<br>
As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate<br>
As amply and unnecessarily<br>
As this Gonzalo; I myself could make<br>
A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore<br>
The mind that I do! what a sleep were this<br>
For your advancement! Do you understand me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And how does your content<br>
Tender your own good fortune?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">I remember<br>
You did supplant your brother Prospero.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">True:<br>
And look how well my garments sit upon me;<br>
Much feater than before: my brother&#8217;s servants<br>
Were then my fellows; now they are my men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">But, for your conscience?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; where lies that? if &#8217;twere a
kibe,<br>
&#8217;Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not<br>
This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,<br>
That stand &#8217;twixt me and Milan, candied be they<br>
And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,<br>
No better than the earth he lies upon,<br>
If he were that which now he&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s dead;<br>
Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,<br>
Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,<br>
To the perpetual wink for aye might put<br>
This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who<br>
Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,<br>
They&#8217;ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;<br>
They&#8217;ll tell the clock to any business that<br>
We say befits the hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Thy case, dear friend,<br>
Shall be my precedent; as thou got&#8217;st Milan,<br>
I&#8217;ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke<br>
Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;<br>
And I the king shall love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Draw together;<br>
And when I rear my hand, do you the like,<br>
To fall it on Gonzalo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">O, but one word.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They talk apart</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel,
invisible</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">My master through his art foresees the danger<br>
That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth&#8212;<br>
For else his project dies&#8212;to keep them living.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings in Gonzalo&#8217;s
ear</span></p>
<p class="speech">While you here do snoring lie,<br>
Open-eyed conspiracy<br>
His time doth take.<br>
If of life you keep a care,<br>
Shake off slumber, and beware:<br>
Awake, awake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Then let us both be sudden.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Now, good angels<br>
Preserve the king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They wake</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?<br>
Wherefore this ghastly looking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Whiles we stood here securing your repose,<br>
Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing<br>
Like bulls, or rather lions: did&#8217;t not wake you?<br>
It struck mine ear most terribly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I heard nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;twas a din to fright a monster&#8217;s
ear,<br>
To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar<br>
Of a whole herd of lions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Heard you this, Gonzalo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,<br>
And that a strange one too, which did awake me:<br>
I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open&#8217;d,<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Caliban with a burden
of wood. A noise of thunder heard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">All the infections that the sun sucks up<br>
From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him<br>
By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me<br>
And yet I needs must curse. But they&#8217;ll nor pinch,<br>
Fright me with urchin&#8212;shows, pitch me i&#8217; the mire,<br>
Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark<br>
Out of my way, unless he bid &#8217;em; but<br>
For every trifle are they set upon me;<br>
Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me<br>
And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which<br>
Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount<br>
Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I<br>
All wound with adders who with cloven tongues<br>
Do hiss me into madness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Trinculo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Lo, now, lo!<br>
Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me<br>
For bringing wood in slowly. I&#8217;ll fall flat;<br>
Perchance he will not mind me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s neither bush nor shrub, to bear
off
any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
I hear it sing i&#8217; the wind: yond same black
cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
should thunder as it did before, I know not
where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
of silver: there would this monster make a
man; any strange beast there makes a man:
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
arms! Warm o&#8217; my troth! I do now let loose
my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
thunderbolt.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Thunder</span></p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is
to
creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
dregs of the storm be past.</p>

Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!<br>
She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,<br>
Yet a tailor might scratch her where&#8217;er she did itch:<br>
Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!<br>

ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;

<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">This is some monster of the isle with four legs,
who
hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
should he learn our language? I will give him some
relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he&#8217;s a
present for any emperor that ever trod on neat&#8217;s leather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Do not torment me, prithee; I&#8217;ll bring my
wood home faster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s in his fit now and does not talk after
the
wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
hath him, and that soundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon,
I
know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is
that
which will give language to you, cat: open your
mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
and that soundly: you cannot tell who&#8217;s your friend:
open your chaps again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I should know that voice: it should be&#8212;but
he is
drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Four legs and two voices: a most delicate
monster!
His forward voice now is to speak well of his
friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
will pour some in thy other mouth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Stephano!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This
is
a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
long spoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me
and
speak to me: for I am Trinculo&#8212;be not afeard&#8212;thy

<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I&#8217;ll
pull thee
by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo&#8217;s legs,
these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
he vent Trinculos?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.
But
art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
under the dead moon-calf&#8217;s gaberdine for fear of
the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
Stephano, two Neapolitans &#8217;scaped!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>

Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness<br>
Are nobly undergone and most poor matters<br>
Point to rich ends. This my mean task<br>
Would be as heavy to me as odious, but<br>
The mistress which I serve quickens what&#8217;s dead<br>
And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is<br>
Ten times more gentle than her father&#8217;s crabbed,<br>
And he&#8217;s composed of harshness. I must remove<br>
Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,<br>
Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress<br>
Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness<br>
Had never like executor. I forget:<br>

The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage<br>
Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues<br>
Have I liked several women; never any<br>
With so fun soul, but some defect in her<br>
Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed<br>
And put it to the foil: but you, O you,<br>
So perfect and so peerless, are created<br>

And my dear father: how features are abroad,<br>
I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,<br>
The jewel in my dower, I would not wish<br>
Any companion in the world but you,<br>
Nor can imagination form a shape,<br>
Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle<br>

<p class="speech">That&#8217;s most certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt be lord of it and I&#8217;ll serve
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">How now shall this be compassed?<br>
Canst thou bring me to the party?</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, yea, my lord: I&#8217;ll yield him thee
asleep,<br>
Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest; thou canst not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">What a pied ninny&#8217;s this! Thou scurvy
patch!<br>
I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows<br>
And take his bottle from him: when that&#8217;s gone<br>
He shall drink nought but brine; for I&#8217;ll not show him<br>
Where the quick freshes are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Trinculo, run into no further danger:
interrupt the monster one word further, and,
by this hand, I&#8217;ll turn my mercy out o&#8217; doors
and make a stock-fish of thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what did I? I did nothing. I&#8217;ll go
farther
off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Didst thou not say he lied?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Do I so? take thou that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats Trinculo</span></p>
<p class="speech">As you like this, give me the lie another
time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I did not give the lie. Out o&#8217; your
wits and bearing too? A pox o&#8217; your bottle!
this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
your monster, and the devil take your fingers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand
farther
off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Beat him enough: after a little time<br>
I&#8217;ll beat him too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Stand farther. Come, proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Why, as I told thee, &#8217;tis a custom with
him,<br>
I&#8217; th&#8217; afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain
him,<br>
Having first seized his books, or with a log<br>
Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,<br>
Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember<br>
First to possess his books; for without them<br>
He&#8217;s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not<br>
One spirit to command: they all do hate him<br>
As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.<br>
He has brave utensils,&#8212;for so he calls them&#8212;<br>
Which when he has a house, he&#8217;ll deck withal<br>
And that most deeply to consider is<br>
The beauty of his daughter; he himself<br>
Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,<br>
But only Sycorax my dam and she;<br>
But she as far surpasseth Sycorax<br>
As great&#8217;st does least.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Is it so brave a lass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.<br>
And bring thee forth brave brood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and
I
will be king and queen&#8212;save our graces!&#8212;and
Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
like the plot, Trinculo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee;
but,
while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Within this half hour will he be asleep:<br>
Wilt thou destroy him then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, on mine honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">This will I tell my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:<br>
Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch<br>
You taught me but while-ere?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">At thy request, monster, I will do reason,
any
reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">Flout &#8217;em and scout &#8217;em<br>
And scout &#8217;em and flout &#8217;em<br>
Thought is free.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not the tune.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Ariel plays the tune on a
tabour and pipe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">What is this same?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">This is the tune of our catch, played by the
picture
of Nobody.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy
likeness:
if thou beest a devil, take&#8217;t as thou list.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">O, forgive me my sins!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy
upon us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou afeard?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">No, monster, not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,<br>
Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.<br>
Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments<br>
Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices<br>
That, if I then had waked after long sleep,<br>
Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,<br>
The clouds methought would open and show riches<br>
Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,<br>
I cried to dream again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I
shall
have my music for nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">When Prospero is destroyed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">That shall be by and by: I remember the
story.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">The sound is going away; let&#8217;s follow it,
and
after do our work.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Lead, monster; we&#8217;ll follow. I would I
could see
this tabourer; he lays it on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt come? I&#8217;ll follow, Stephano.</p>

Antonio, Gonzalo, Adrian, Francisco, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">By&#8217;r lakin, I can go no further, sir;<br>
My old bones ache: here&#8217;s a maze trod indeed<br>
Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,<br>
I needs must rest me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Old lord, I cannot blame thee,<br>
Who am myself attach&#8217;d with weariness,<br>
To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.<br>
Even here I will put off my hope and keep it<br>
No longer for my flatterer: he is drown&#8217;d<br>
Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks<br>
Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Sebastian]</span> I
am right glad that he&#8217;s so

That you resolved to effect.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Antonio]</span> The

Will we take throughly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Sebastian]</span>
Let it be to-night;<br>
For, now they are oppress&#8217;d with travel, they<br>
Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance<br>
As when they are fresh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Antonio]</span> I
say, to-night: no more.</p>

music</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Marvellous sweet music!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prospero above,
invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and,
inviting the King, &amp; c. to eat, they depart</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were
these?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">A living drollery. Now I will believe<br>
That there are unicorns, that in Arabia<br>
There is one tree, the phoenix&#8217; throne, one phoenix<br>
At this hour reigning there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll believe both;<br>
And what does else want credit, come to me,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;tis true: travellers ne&#8217;er
did
lie,<br>
Though fools at home condemn &#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">If in Naples<br>
I should report this now, would they believe me?<br>
If I should say, I saw such islanders&#8212;<br>
For, certes, these are people of the island&#8212;<br>
Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,<br>
Their manners are more gentle-kind than of<br>
Our human generation you shall find<br>
Many, nay, almost any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Honest
lord,<br>
Thou hast said well; for some of you there present<br>
Are worse than devils.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot too much muse<br>
Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,<br>

They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.<br>
Will&#8217;t please you taste of what is here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were
boys,<br>
Who would believe that there were mountaineers<br>
Dew-lapp&#8217;d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at
&#8217;em<br>
Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men<br>
Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find<br>
Each putter-out of five for one will bring us<br>
Good warrant of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will stand to and feed,<br>
Although my last: no matter, since I feel<br>
The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,<br>
Stand to and do as we.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Thunder and lightning. Enter
Ariel, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a
quaint device, the banquet vanishes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,<br>
That hath to instrument this lower world<br>
And what is in&#8217;t, the never-surfeited sea<br>
Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island<br>
Where man doth not inhabit; you &#8217;mongst men<br>
Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;<br>
And even with such-like valour men hang and drown<br>
Their proper selves.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alonso, Sebastian &amp; c.
draw their swords</span></p>
<p class="speech">You fools! I and my fellows<br>
Are ministers of Fate: the elements,<br>
Of whom your swords are temper&#8217;d, may as well<br>
Wound the loud winds, or with bemock&#8217;d-at stabs<br>
Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish<br>
One dowle that&#8217;s in my plume: my fellow-ministers<br>
Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,<br>
Your swords are now too massy for your strengths<br>
And will not be uplifted. But remember&#8212;<br>
For that&#8217;s my business to you&#8212;that you three<br>
From Milan did supplant good Prospero;<br>
Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,<br>
Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed<br>
The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have<br>
Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,<br>
Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,<br>
They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:<br>
Lingering perdition, worse than any death<br>
Can be at once, shall step by step attend<br>
You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from&#8212;<br>
Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls<br>
Upon your heads&#8212;is nothing but heart-sorrow<br>
And a clear life ensuing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He vanishes in thunder; then,
to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and
mows, and carrying out the table</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou<br>
Perform&#8217;d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:<br>
Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated<br>
In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life<br>
And observation strange, my meaner ministers<br>
Their several kinds have done. My high charms work<br>
And these mine enemies are all knit up<br>
In their distractions; they now are in my power;<br>
And in these fits I leave them, while I visit<br>
Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown&#8217;d,<br>
And his and mine loved darling.</p>

In this strange stare?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">O, it is monstrous, monstrous:<br>
Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;<br>
The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,<br>
That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced<br>
The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.<br>
Therefore my son i&#8217; the ooze is bedded, and<br>
I&#8217;ll seek him deeper than e&#8217;er plummet sounded<br>
And with him there lie mudded.</p>

I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations<br>
Were but my trials of thy love and thou<br>
Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,<br>
I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,<br>
Do not smile at me that I boast her off,<br>
For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise<br>
And make it halt behind her.</p>

All sanctimonious ceremonies may<br>
With full and holy rite be minister&#8217;d,<br>
No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall<br>
To make this contract grow: but barren hate,<br>
Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew<br>

For quiet days, fair issue and long life,<br>
With such love as &#8217;tis now, the murkiest den,<br>

<p class="speech">Let me live here ever;<br>
So rare a wonder&#8217;d father and a wife<br>
Makes this place Paradise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Juno and Ceres whisper, and
send Iris on employment</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet, now, silence!<br>
Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;<br>
There&#8217;s something else to do: hush, and be mute,<br>
Or else our spell is marr&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iris</p>
<p class="speech">You nymphs, call&#8217;d Naiads, of the windring
brooks,<br>
With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,<br>
Leave your crisp channels and on this green land<br>
Answer your summons; Juno does command:<br>
Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate<br>
A contract of true love; be not too late.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter certain
Nymphs</span></p>
<p class="speech">You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,<br>
Come hither from the furrow and be merry:<br>
Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on<br>
And these fresh nymphs encounter every one<br>
In country footing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter certain Reapers,
properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
towards the end whereof Prospero starts suddenly, and speaks; after
which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily
vanish</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I had forgot
that foul conspiracy<br>
Of the beast Caliban and his confederates<br>
Against my life: the minute of their plot<br>
Is almost come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To the Spirits</span></p>
<p class="speech">Well done! avoid; no more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">This is strange: your father&#8217;s in some
passion<br>
That works him strongly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Never till this day<br>
Saw I him touch&#8217;d with anger so distemper&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">You do look, my son, in a moved sort,<br>
As if you were dismay&#8217;d: be cheerful, sir.<br>
Our revels now are ended. These our actors,<br>
As I foretold you, were all spirits and<br>
Are melted into air, into thin air:<br>
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,<br>
The cloud-capp&#8217;d towers, the gorgeous palaces,<br>
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,<br>
Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve<br>
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,<br>
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff<br>
As dreams are made on, and our little life<br>
Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex&#8217;d;<br>
Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:<br>
Be not disturb&#8217;d with my infirmity:<br>
If you be pleased, retire into my cell<br>
And there repose: a turn or two I&#8217;ll walk,<br>
To still my beating mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>

<p class="speech">Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel:
come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Thy thoughts I cleave to. What&#8217;s thy
pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Spirit,<br>
We must prepare to meet with Caliban.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,<br>
I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear&#8217;d<br>
Lest I might anger thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Say again, where didst thou leave these
varlets?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I told you, sir, they were red-hot with
drinking;<br>
So fun of valour that they smote the air<br>
For breathing in their faces; beat the ground<br>
For kissing of their feet; yet always bending<br>
Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;<br>
At which, like unback&#8217;d colts, they prick&#8217;d
their ears,<br>
Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses<br>
As they smelt music: so I charm&#8217;d their ears<br>
That calf-like they my lowing follow&#8217;d through<br>
Tooth&#8217;d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,<br>
Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them<br>
I&#8217; the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,<br>
There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake<br>
O&#8217;erstunk their feet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">This was well done, my bird.<br>
Thy shape invisible retain thou still:<br>
The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,<br>
For stale to catch these thieves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I go, I go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">A devil, a born devil, on whose nature<br>
Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,<br>
Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;<br>
And as with age his body uglier grows,<br>
So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,<br>
Even to roaring.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel, loaden with
glistering apparel, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, hang them on this line.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Prospero and Ariel remain
invisible. Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all
wet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may
not<br>
Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Monster, your fairy, which you say is
a harmless fairy, has done little better than
played the Jack with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
which my nose is in great indignation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should
take
a displeasure against you, look you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wert but a lost monster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, give me thy favour still.<br>
Be patient, for the prize I&#8217;ll bring thee to<br>
Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.<br>
All&#8217;s hush&#8217;d as midnight yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but to lose our bottles in the
pool,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">There is not only disgrace and dishonour in
that,
monster, but an infinite loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s more to me than my wetting: yet this
is your
harmless fairy, monster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">I will fetch off my bottle, though I be
o&#8217;er ears
for my labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,<br>
This is the mouth o&#8217; the cell: no noise, and enter.<br>
Do that good mischief which may make this island<br>
Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,<br>
For aye thy foot-licker.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody
thoughts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano!
look
what a wardrobe here is for thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a
frippery.<br>
O king Stephano!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand,
I&#8217;ll have
that gown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Thy grace shall have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean<br>
To dote thus on such luggage? Let&#8217;s alone<br>
And do the murder first: if he awake,<br>
From toe to crown he&#8217;ll fill our skins with pinches,<br>
Make us strange stuff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
hair and prove a bald jerkin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Do, do: we steal by line and level, an&#8217;t
like your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee for that jest; here&#8217;s a
garment for&#8217;t:
wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
country. &#8216;Steal by line and level&#8217; is an excellent
pass of pate; there&#8217;s another garment for&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,
and
away with the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">I will have none on&#8217;t: we shall lose our
time,<br>
And all be turn&#8217;d to barnacles, or to apes<br>
With foreheads villanous low.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear
this
away where my hogshead of wine is, or I&#8217;ll turn you
out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">And this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and this.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A noise of hunters heard.
Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them
about, Prospero and Ariel setting them on</span></p>

<p class="speech">Hark, they roar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour<br>
Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:<br>

<h4>Scene I. Before Prospero&#8217;s cell.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prospero in his magic
robes, and Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Now does my project gather to a head:<br>
My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time<br>
Goes upright with his carriage. How&#8217;s the day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,<br>
You said our work should cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">I did say so,<br>
When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,<br>
How fares the king and&#8217;s followers?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Confined together<br>
In the same fashion as you gave in charge,<br>
Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,<br>
In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;<br>
They cannot budge till your release. The king,<br>
His brother and yours, abide all three distracted<br>
And the remainder mourning over them,<br>
Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly<br>
Him that you term&#8217;d, sir, &#8216;The good old lord
Gonzalo;&#8217;<br>
His tears run down his beard, like winter&#8217;s drops<br>
From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works &#8217;em<br>
That if you now beheld them, your affections<br>
Would become tender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou think so, spirit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">Mine would, sir, were I human.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">And mine shall.<br>
Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling<br>
Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,<br>
One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,<br>
Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?<br>
Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,<br>
Yet with my nobler reason &#8217;gaitist my fury<br>
Do I take part: the rarer action is<br>
In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,<br>
The sole drift of my purpose doth extend<br>
Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:<br>
My charms I&#8217;ll break, their senses I&#8217;ll restore,<br>
And they shall be themselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll fetch them, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and
groves,<br>
And ye that on the sands with printless foot<br>
Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him<br>
When he comes back; you demi-puppets that<br>
By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,<br>
Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime<br>
Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice<br>
To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,<br>
Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm&#8217;d<br>
The noontide sun, call&#8217;d forth the mutinous winds,<br>
And &#8217;twixt the green sea and the azured vault<br>
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder<br>
Have I given fire and rifted Jove&#8217;s stout oak<br>
With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory<br>
Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck&#8217;d up<br>
The pine and cedar: graves at my command<br>
Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let &#8217;em forth<br>
By my so potent art. But this rough magic<br>
I here abjure, and, when I have required<br>
Some heavenly music, which even now I do,<br>
To work mine end upon their senses that<br>
This airy charm is for, I&#8217;ll break my staff,<br>
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,<br>
And deeper than did ever plummet sound<br>
I&#8217;ll drown my book.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Solemn music</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel before: then
Alonso, with a frantic gesture, attended by Gonzalo; Sebastian and
Antonio in like manner, attended by Adrian and Francisco they all
enter the circle which Prospero had made, and there stand charmed;
which Prospero observing, speaks:</span></p>
<p class="speech">A solemn air and the best comforter<br>
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,<br>
Now useless, boil&#8217;d within thy skull! There stand,<br>
For you are spell-stopp&#8217;d.<br>
Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,<br>
Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,<br>
Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,<br>
And as the morning steals upon the night,<br>
Melting the darkness, so their rising senses<br>
Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle<br>
Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,<br>
My true preserver, and a loyal sir<br>
To him you follow&#8217;st! I will pay thy graces<br>
Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly<br>
Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:<br>
Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.<br>
Thou art pinch&#8217;d fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,<br>
You, brother mine, that entertain&#8217;d ambition,<br>
Expell&#8217;d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,<br>
Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,<br>
Would here have kill&#8217;d your king; I do forgive thee,<br>
Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding<br>
Begins to swell, and the approaching tide<br>
Will shortly fill the reasonable shore<br>
That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them<br>
That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,<br>
Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:<br>
I will discase me, and myself present<br>

Merrily, merrily shall I live now<br>
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss
thee:<br>
But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.<br>
To the king&#8217;s ship, invisible as thou art:<br>
There shalt thou find the mariners asleep<br>
Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain<br>
Being awake, enforce them to this place,<br>
And presently, I prithee.</p>

The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:<br>
For more assurance that a living prince<br>

And to thee and thy company I bid<br>
A hearty welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Whether thou best he or no,<br>
Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,<br>
As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse<br>
Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,<br>
The affliction of my mind amends, with which,<br>
I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,<br>
An if this be at all, a most strange story.<br>
Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat<br>
Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero<br>
Be living and be here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">First, noble friend,<br>
Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot<br>
Be measured or confined.</p>

Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speech">But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,<br>

Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require<br>
My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,<br>
Thou must restore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;If thou be&#8217;st Prospero,<br>
Give us particulars of thy preservation;<br>
How thou hast met us here, who three hours since<br>
Were wreck&#8217;d upon this shore; where I have lost&#8212;<br>
How sharp the point of this remembrance is!&#8212;<br>
My dear son Ferdinand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">I am woe for&#8217;t, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Irreparable is the loss, and patience<br>
Says it is past her cure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">I rather think<br>
You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace<br>
For the like loss I have her sovereign aid<br>
And rest myself content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">You the like loss!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">As great to me as late; and, supportable<br>
To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker<br>
Than you may call to comfort you, for I<br>
Have lost my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">A daughter?<br>
O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,<br>
The king and queen there! that they were, I wish<br>
Myself were mudded in that oozy bed<br>
Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">In this last tempest. I perceive these lords<br>
At this encounter do so much admire<br>
That they devour their reason and scarce think<br>
Their eyes do offices of truth, their words<br>
Are natural breath: but, howsoe&#8217;er you have<br>
Been justled from your senses, know for certain<br>
That I am Prospero and that very duke<br>
Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely<br>
Upon this shore, where you were wreck&#8217;d, was landed,<br>
To be the lord on&#8217;t. No more yet of this;<br>
For &#8217;tis a chronicle of day by day,<br>
Not a relation for a breakfast nor<br>
Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;<br>
This cell&#8217;s my court: here have I few attendants<br>
And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.<br>
My dukedom since you have given me again,<br>
I will requite you with as good a thing;<br>
At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye<br>
As much as me my dukedom.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here Prospero discovers
Ferdinand and Miranda playing at chess</span></p>

<p class="speech">No, my dear&#8217;st love,<br>
I would not for the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should
wrangle,<br>
And I would call it, fair play.</p>

<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>

Arise, and say how thou camest here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Miranda</p>
<p class="speech">O, wonder!<br>
How many goodly creatures are there here!<br>
How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,<br>
That has such people in&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis new to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">What is this maid with whom thou wast at
play?<br>
Your eld&#8217;st acquaintance cannot be three hours:<br>
Is she the goddess that hath sever&#8217;d us,<br>
And brought us thus together?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ferdinand</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, she is mortal;<br>
But by immortal Providence she&#8217;s mine:<br>
I chose her when I could not ask my father<br>
For his advice, nor thought I had one. She<br>
Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,<br>
Of whom so often I have heard renown,<br>
But never saw before; of whom I have<br>
Received a second life; and second father<br>
This lady makes him to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I am hers:<br>
But, O, how oddly will it sound that I<br>
Must ask my child forgiveness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">There, sir, stop:<br>
Let us not burthen our remembrance with<br>
A heaviness that&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">I have inly wept,<br>
Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,<br>
And on this couple drop a blessed crown!<br>
For it is you that have chalk&#8217;d forth the way<br>
Which brought us hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I say, Amen, Gonzalo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue<br>
Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice<br>
Beyond a common joy, and set it down<br>
With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage<br>
Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,<br>
And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife<br>
Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom<br>
In a poor isle and all of us ourselves<br>
When no man was his own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Ferdinand and
Miranda]</span> Give me your hands:<br>
Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart<br>
That doth not wish you joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gonzalo</p>
<p class="speech">Be it so! Amen!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel, with the
Master and Boatswain amazedly following</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:<br>
I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,<br>
This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,<br>
That swear&#8217;st grace o&#8217;erboard, not an oath on
shore?<br>
Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">The best news is, that we have safely found<br>
Our king and company; the next, our ship&#8212;<br>
Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split&#8212;<br>
Is tight and yare and bravely rigg&#8217;d as when<br>
We first put out to sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Prospero]</span>
Sir, all this service<br>
Have I done since I went.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Ariel]</span> My
tricksy spirit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">These are not natural events; they strengthen<br>
From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boatswain</p>
<p class="speech">If I did think, sir, I were well awake,<br>
I&#8217;ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,<br>
And&#8212;how we know not&#8212;all clapp&#8217;d under
hatches;<br>
Where but even now with strange and several noises<br>
Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,<br>
And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,<br>
We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;<br>
Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld<br>
Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master<br>
Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,<br>
Even in a dream, were we divided from them<br>
And were brought moping hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ariel</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Prospero]</span>
Was&#8217;t well done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Ariel]</span>
Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">This is as strange a maze as e&#8217;er men
trod<br>
And there is in this business more than nature<br>
Was ever conduct of: some oracle<br>
Must rectify our knowledge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my liege,<br>
Do not infest your mind with beating on<br>
The strangeness of this business; at pick&#8217;d leisure<br>
Which shall be shortly, single I&#8217;ll resolve you,<br>
Which to you shall seem probable, of every<br>
These happen&#8217;d accidents; till when, be cheerful<br>
And think of each thing well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside to Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, spirit:<br>
Set Caliban and his companions free;<br>
Untie the spell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speech">How fares my gracious sir?<br>
There are yet missing of your company<br>
Some few odd lads that you remember not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Ariel, driving in
Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo, in their stolen apparel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">Every man shift for all the rest, and
let no man take care for himself; for all is
but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">If these be true spies which I wear in my
head,
here&#8217;s a goodly sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!<br>
How fine my master is! I am afraid<br>
He will chastise me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha!<br>
What things are these, my lord Antonio?<br>
Will money buy &#8217;em?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Very like; one of them<br>
Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,<br>
Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,<br>
His mother was a witch, and one so strong<br>
That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,<br>
And deal in her command without her power.<br>
These three have robb&#8217;d me; and this demi-devil&#8212;<br>
For he&#8217;s a bastard one&#8212;had plotted with them<br>
To take my life. Two of these fellows you<br>
Must know and own; this thing of darkness!<br>
Acknowledge mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I shall be pinch&#8217;d to
death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">He is drunk now: where had he wine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should
they<br>
Find this grand liquor that hath gilded &#8217;em?<br>
How camest thou in this pickle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trinculo</p>
<p class="speech">I have been in such a pickle since I
saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Stephano!</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a
cramp.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ld be king o&#8217; the isle,
sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stephano</p>
<p class="speech">I should have been a sore one then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">This is a strange thing as e&#8217;er I
look&#8217;d on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to
Caliban</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">He is as disproportion&#8217;d in his manners<br>
As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;<br>
Take with you your companions; as you look<br>
To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caliban</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that I will; and I&#8217;ll be wise
hereafter<br>
And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass<br>
Was I, to take this drunkard for a god<br>
And worship this dull fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sebastian</p>
<p class="speech">Or stole it, rather.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Caliban, Stephano, and
Trinculo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I invite your highness and your train<br>
To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest<br>
For this one night; which, part of it, I&#8217;ll waste<br>
With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it<br>
Go quick away; the story of my life<br>
And the particular accidents gone by<br>
Since I came to this isle: and in the morn<br>
I&#8217;ll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,<br>
Where I have hope to see the nuptial<br>
Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;<br>
And thence retire me to my Milan, where<br>
Every third thought shall be my grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alonso</p>
<p class="speech">I long<br>
To hear the story of your life, which must<br>
Take the ear strangely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll deliver all;<br>
And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales<br>
And sail so expeditious that shall catch<br>
Your royal fleet far off.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside to Ariel</span></p>
<p class="speech">My Ariel, chick,<br>
That is thy charge: then to the elements<br>
Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<h4>Epilogue</h4>
<p class="speaker">Prospero</p>
<p class="speech">Now my charms are all o&#8217;erthrown,<br>
And what strength I have&#8217;s mine own,<br>
Which is most faint: now, &#8217;tis true,<br>
I must be here confined by you,<br>
Or sent to Naples. Let me not,<br>
Since I have my dukedom got<br>
And pardon&#8217;d the deceiver, dwell<br>
In this bare island by your spell;<br>
But release me from my bands<br>
With the help of your good hands:<br>
Gentle breath of yours my sails<br>
Must fill, or else my project fails,<br>
Which was to please. Now I want<br>
Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,<br>
And my ending is despair,<br>
Unless I be relieved by prayer,<br>
Which pierces so that it assaults<br>
Mercy itself and frees all faults.<br>
As you from crimes would pardon&#8217;d be,<br>
Let your indulgence set me free.</p>
