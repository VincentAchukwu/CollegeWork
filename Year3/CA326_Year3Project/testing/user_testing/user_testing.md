# User Testing

For user testing, we set up a survey consisting of 8 questions and got 8 responses to the survey. We ran the survey online due to the current circumstances. Although the users were friends, we tried to select them from a broad demographic as possible. The users consisted of mixed backgrounds including technical, financial, and users not familiar with either.

Question 2 of the user survey asked what the least appealing thing about our application. One user stated that certain currencies broke the graph, and another stated that there was no guide as to how to use the app. We acknowledged these issues and these responses allowed us to update the UI as well as the functionality of the application to meet user needs.
Other responses revolved around having more features such as a prediction feature for currencies, selecting currencies from a list/table rather than typing them, and categorising the currencies (i.e. having the cryptocurrencies in their own section).
Overall the users seemed rather satisfied with the application. If we had more time and experience with Android Development using React Native, we would definitely have had a more improved final product which would greatly satisfy most users.

We learned more from the user testing and this provided us with the opportunity to add any final updates to the UI of the application and fix any bugs encountered. This was the importance of user feedback.
