"Scene I. London. The Parliament-house.">
<h4>Scene I. London. The Parliament-house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Enter York, Edward,
Richard, Norfolk, Montague, Warwick, and Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder how the king escaped our hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">While we pursued the horsemen of the north,<br>
He slily stole away and left his men:<br>
Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,<br>
Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,<br>
Cheer&#8217;d up the drooping army; and himself,<br>
Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,<br>
Charged our main battle&#8217;s front, and breaking in<br>
Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Stafford&#8217;s father, Duke of
Buckingham,<br>
Is either slain or wounded dangerously;<br>
I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:<br>
That this is true, father, behold his blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">And, brother, here&#8217;s the Earl of
Wiltshire&#8217;s blood,<br>
Whom I encounter&#8217;d as the battles join&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throwing down
Somerset&#8217;s head</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.<br>
But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Thus do I hope to shake King Henry&#8217;s
head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,<br>
Before I see thee seated in that throne<br>
Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,<br>
I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.<br>
This is the palace of the fearful king,<br>
And this the regal seat: possess it, York;<br>
For this is thine and not King Henry&#8217;s heirs&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;<br>
For hither we have broken in by force.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll all assist you; he that flies shall
die.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;<br>
And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They go up</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And when the king comes, offer no violence,<br>
Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">The queen this day here holds her parliament,<br>
But little thinks we shall be of her council:<br>
By words or blows here let us win our right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Arm&#8217;d as we are, let&#8217;s stay within
this house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">The bloody parliament shall this be
call&#8217;d,<br>
Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,<br>
And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice<br>
Hath made us by-words to our enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;<br>
I mean to take possession of my right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,<br>
The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,<br>
Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.<br>
I&#8217;ll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:<br>
Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter King Henry
VI, Clifford, Northumberland, Westmoreland, Exeter, and the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,<br>
Even in the chair of state: belike he means,<br>
Back&#8217;d by the power of Warwick, that false peer,<br>
To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.<br>
Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.<br>
And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow&#8217;d revenge<br>
On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in
steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall we suffer this? let&#8217;s pluck him
down:<br>
My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Patience is for poltroons, such as he:<br>
He durst not sit there, had your father lived.<br>
My gracious lord, here in the parliament<br>
Let us assail the family of York.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, know you not the city favours them,<br>
And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">But when the duke is slain, they&#8217;ll quickly
fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Far be the thought of this from Henry&#8217;s
heart,<br>
To make a shambles of the parliament-house!<br>
Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats<br>
Shall be the war that Henry means to use.<br>
Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,<br>
And kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;<br>
I am thy sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I am thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of
York.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas my inheritance, as the earldom
was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Thy father was a traitor to the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown<br>
In following this usurping Henry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Whom should he follow but his natural king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">True, Clifford; and that&#8217;s Richard Duke of
York.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">It must and shall be so: content thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;<br>
And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget<br>
That we are those which chased you from the field<br>
And slew your fathers, and with colours spread<br>
March&#8217;d through the city to the palace gates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;<br>
And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,<br>
Thy kinsman and thy friends, I&#8217;ll have more lives<br>
Than drops of blood were in my father&#8217;s veins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,<br>
I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger<br>
As shall revenge his death before I stir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless
threats!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Will you we show our title to the crown?<br>
If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?<br>
Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;<br>
Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:<br>
I am the son of Henry the Fifth,<br>
Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop<br>
And seized upon their towns and provinces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">The lord protector lost it, and not I:<br>
When I was crown&#8217;d I was but nine months old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you
lose.<br>
Father, tear the crown from the usurper&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest
arms,<br>
Let&#8217;s fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will
fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Sons, peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to
speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him,
lords;<br>
And be you silent and attentive too,<br>
For he that interrupts him shall not live.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Think&#8217;st thou that I will leave my kingly
throne,<br>
Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?<br>
No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;<br>
Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,<br>
And now in England to our heart&#8217;s great sorrow,<br>
Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?<br>
My title&#8217;s good, and better far than his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas by rebellion against his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I know not
what to say; my title&#8217;s weak.&#8212;<br>
Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">An if he may, then am I lawful king;<br>
For Richard, in the view of many lords,<br>
Resign&#8217;d the crown to Henry the Fourth,<br>
Whose heir my father was, and I am his.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">He rose against him, being his sovereign,<br>
And made him to resign his crown perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Suppose, my lords, he did it
unconstrain&#8217;d,<br>
Think you &#8217;twere prejudicial to his crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">No; for he could not so resign his crown<br>
But that the next heir should succeed and reign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">His is the right, and therefore pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">My conscience tells me he is lawful king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> All will
revolt from me, and turn to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Plantagenet, for all the claim thou
lay&#8217;st,<br>
Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art deceived: &#8217;tis not thy southern
power,<br>
Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,<br>
Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,<br>
Can set the duke up in despite of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,<br>
Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:<br>
May that ground gape and swallow me alive,<br>
Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.<br>
What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Do right unto this princely Duke of York,<br>
Or I will fill the house with armed men,<br>
And over the chair of state, where now he sits,<br>
Write up his title with usurping blood.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He stamps with his foot and
the soldiers show themselves</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:<br>
Let me for this my life-time reign as king.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,<br>
And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I am content: Richard Plantagenet,<br>
Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">What wrong is this unto the prince your son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">What good is this to England and himself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Base, fearful and despairing Henry!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">How hast thou injured both thyself and us!</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot stay to hear these articles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these
news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,<br>
In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Be thou a prey unto the house of York,<br>
And die in bands for this unmanly deed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,<br>
Or live in peace abandon&#8217;d and despised!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Northumberland,
Clifford, and Westmoreland</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">They seek revenge and therefore will not
yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Exeter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why should you sigh, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,<br>
Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.<br>
But be it as it may: I here entail<br>
The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;<br>
Conditionally, that here thou take an oath<br>
To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,<br>
To honour me as thy king and sovereign,<br>
And neither by treason nor hostility<br>
To seek to put me down and reign thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">This oath I willingly take and will perform.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And long live thou and these thy forward
sons!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sennet. Here they come

<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her
anger:<br>
I&#8217;ll steal away.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Exeter, so will I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Who can be patient in such extremes?<br>
Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid<br>
And never seen thee, never borne thee son,<br>
Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father<br>
Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?<br>
Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,<br>
Or felt that pain which I did for him once,<br>
Or nourish&#8217;d him as I did with my blood,<br>
Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,<br>
Rather than have that savage duke thine heir<br>
And disinherited thine only son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Father, you cannot disinherit me:<br>
If you be king, why should not I succeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:<br>
The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be
forced?<br>
I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!<br>
Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;<br>
And given unto the house of York such head<br>
As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.<br>
To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,<br>
What is it, but to make thy sepulchre<br>
And creep into it far before thy time?<br>
Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;<br>
Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;<br>
The duke is made protector of the realm;<br>
And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds<br>
The trembling lamb environed with wolves.<br>
Had I been there, which am a silly woman,<br>
The soldiers should have toss&#8217;d me on their pikes<br>
Before I would have granted to that act.<br>
But thou preferr&#8217;st thy life before thine honour:<br>
And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself<br>
Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,<br>
Until that act of parliament be repeal&#8217;d<br>
Whereby my son is disinherited.<br>
The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours<br>
Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;<br>
And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace<br>
And utter ruin of the house of York.<br>
Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let&#8217;s away;<br>
Our army is ready; come, we&#8217;ll after them.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee
gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to be murder&#8217;d by his enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">When I return with victory from the field<br>
I&#8217;ll see your grace: till then I&#8217;ll follow her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Queen Margaret and
Prince Edward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Poor queen! how love to me and to her son<br>
Hath made her break out into terms of rage!<br>
Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,<br>
Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,<br>
Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle<br>
Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!<br>
The loss of those three lords torments my heart:<br>
I&#8217;ll write unto them and entreat them fair.<br>
Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>

What is your quarrel? how began it first?</p>

That hath authority over him that swears:<br>
Henry had none, but did usurp the place;<br>
Then, seeing &#8217;twas he that made you to depose,<br>
Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.<br>
Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think<br>
How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;<br>
Within whose circuit is Elysium<br>
And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.<br>

My brother Montague shall post to London:<br>

My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:<br>
But this I know, they have demean&#8217;d themselves<br>
Like men born to renown by life or death.<br>
Three times did Richard make a lane to me.<br>
And thrice cried &#8216;Courage, father! fight it out!&#8217;<br>
And full as oft came Edward to my side,<br>
With purple falchion, painted to the hilt<br>
In blood of those that had encounter&#8217;d him:<br>

Was&#8217;t you that revell&#8217;d in our parliament,<br>

Where are your mess of sons to back you now?<br>

And where&#8217;s that valiant crook-back prodigy,<br>
Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice<br>

Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?<br>
Look, York: I stain&#8217;d this napkin with the blood<br>
That valiant Clifford, with his rapier&#8217;s point,<br>
Made issue from the bosom of the boy;<br>
And if thine eyes can water for his death,<br>

Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,<br>

Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.<br>

Whose tongue more poisons than the adder&#8217;s tooth!<br>
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex<br>
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,<br>
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!<br>
But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,<br>
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,<br>
I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.<br>
To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,<br>
Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.<br>
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,<br>
Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,<br>
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.<br>
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?<br>
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,<br>
Unless the adage must be verified,<br>
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.<br>
&#8217;Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;<br>
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:<br>
&#8217;Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;<br>
The contrary doth make thee wonder&#8217;d at:<br>
&#8217;Tis government that makes them seem divine;<br>
The want thereof makes thee abominable:<br>
Thou art as opposite to every good<br>
As the Antipodes are unto us,<br>
Or as the south to the septentrion.<br>
O tiger&#8217;s heart wrapt in a woman&#8217;s hide!<br>
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,<br>
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,<br>
And yet be seen to bear a woman&#8217;s face?<br>
Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;<br>
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.<br>
Bids&#8217;t thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:<br>
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:<br>
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,<br>
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.<br>
These tears are my sweet Rutland&#8217;s obsequies:<br>
And every drop cries vengeance for his death,<br>
&#8217;Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false<br>
Frenchwoman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so<br>

Would not have touch&#8217;d, would not have stain&#8217;d with

But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,<br>
O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.<br>
See, ruthless queen, a hapless father&#8217;s tears:<br>
This cloth thou dip&#8217;dst in blood of my sweet boy,<br>
And I with tears do wash the blood away.<br>
Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:<br>
And if thou tell&#8217;st the heavy story right,<br>
Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;<br>
Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,<br>
And say &#8216;Alas, it was a piteous deed!&#8217;<br>
There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;<br>
And in thy need such comfort come to thee<br>
As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!<br>

I should not for my life but weep with him.<br>

<p class="speech">What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?<br>
Think but upon the wrong he did us all,<br>
And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A march. Enter Edward,
Richard, and their power</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder how our princely father
&#8217;scaped,<br>
Or whether he be &#8217;scaped away or no<br>
From Clifford&#8217;s and Northumberland&#8217;s pursuit:<br>
Had he been ta&#8217;en, we should have heard the news;<br>
Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;<br>
Or had he &#8217;scaped, methinks we should have heard<br>
The happy tidings of his good escape.<br>
How fares my brother? why is he so sad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot joy, until I be resolved<br>
Where our right valiant father is become.<br>
I saw him in the battle range about;<br>
And watch&#8217;d him how he singled Clifford forth.<br>
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop<br>
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;<br>
Or as a bear, encompass&#8217;d round with dogs,<br>
Who having pinch&#8217;d a few and made them cry,<br>
The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.<br>
So fared our father with his enemies;<br>
So fled his enemies my warlike father:<br>
Methinks, &#8217;tis prize enough to be his son.<br>
See how the morning opes her golden gates,<br>
And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!<br>
How well resembles it the prime of youth,<br>
Trimm&#8217;d like a younker prancing to his love!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;<br>
Not separated with the racking clouds,<br>
But sever&#8217;d in a pale clear-shining sky.<br>
See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,<br>
As if they vow&#8217;d some league inviolable:<br>
Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.<br>
In this the heaven figures some event.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never
heard of.<br>
I think it cites us, brother, to the field,<br>
That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,<br>
Each one already blazing by our meeds,<br>
Should notwithstanding join our lights together<br>
And over-shine the earth as this the world.<br>
Whate&#8217;er it bodes, henceforward will I bear<br>
Upon my target three fair-shining suns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak
it,<br>
You love the breeder better than the male.</p>

Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, one that was a woful looker-on<br>
When as the noble Duke of York was slain,<br>
Your princely father and my loving lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Say how he died, for I will hear it all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Environed he was with many foes,<br>
And stood against them, as the hope of Troy<br>
Against the Greeks that would have enter&#8217;d Troy.<br>
But Hercules himself must yield to odds;<br>
And many strokes, though with a little axe,<br>
Hew down and fell the hardest-timber&#8217;d oak.<br>
By many hands your father was subdued;<br>
But only slaughter&#8217;d by the ireful arm<br>
Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,<br>
Who crown&#8217;d the gracious duke in high despite,<br>
Laugh&#8217;d in his face; and when with grief he wept,<br>
The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks<br>
A napkin steeped in the harmless blood<br>
Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:<br>
And after many scorns, many foul taunts,<br>
They took his head, and on the gates of York<br>
They set the same; and there it doth remain,<br>
The saddest spectacle that e&#8217;er I view&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,<br>
Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.<br>
O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain<br>
The flower of Europe for his chivalry;<br>
And treacherously hast thou vanquish&#8217;d him,<br>
For hand to hand he would have vanquish&#8217;d thee.<br>
Now my soul&#8217;s palace is become a prison:<br>
Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body<br>
Might in the ground be closed up in rest!<br>
For never henceforth shall I joy again,<br>
Never, O never shall I see more joy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot weep; for all my
body&#8217;s moisture<br>
Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:<br>
Nor can my tongue unload my heart&#8217;s great burthen;<br>
For selfsame wind that I should speak withal<br>
Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,<br>
And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.<br>
To weep is to make less the depth of grief:<br>
Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me<br>
Richard, I bear thy name; I&#8217;ll venge thy death,<br>
Or die renowned by attempting it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">His name that valiant duke hath left with
thee;<br>
His dukedom and his chair with me is left.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if thou be that princely eagle&#8217;s
bird,<br>
Show thy descent by gazing &#8217;gainst the sun:<br>
For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;<br>
Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">March. Enter Warwick,
Montague, and their army</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">How now, fair lords! What fare? what news
abroad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount<br>
Our baleful news, and at each word&#8217;s deliverance<br>
Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,<br>
The words would add more anguish than the wounds.<br>
O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,<br>
Which held three dearly as his soul&#8217;s redemption,<br>
Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Ten days ago I drown&#8217;d these news in
tears;<br>
And now, to add more measure to your woes,<br>
I come to tell you things sith then befall&#8217;n.<br>
After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,<br>
Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,<br>
Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,<br>
Were brought me of your loss and his depart.<br>
I, then in London keeper of the king,<br>
Muster&#8217;d my soldiers, gather&#8217;d flocks of friends,<br>
And very well appointed, as I thought,<br>
March&#8217;d toward Saint Alban&#8217;s to intercept the
queen,<br>
Bearing the king in my behalf along;<br>
For by my scouts I was advertised<br>
That she was coming with a full intent<br>
To dash our late decree in parliament<br>
Touching King Henry&#8217;s oath and your succession.<br>
Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban&#8217;s met<br>
Our battles join&#8217;d, and both sides fiercely fought:<br>
But whether &#8217;twas the coldness of the king,<br>
Who look&#8217;d full gently on his warlike queen,<br>
That robb&#8217;d my soldiers of their heated spleen;<br>
Or whether &#8217;twas report of her success;<br>
Or more than common fear of Clifford&#8217;s rigour,<br>
Who thunders to his captives blood and death,<br>
I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,<br>
Their weapons like to lightning came and went;<br>
Our soldiers&#8217;, like the night-owl&#8217;s lazy flight,<br>
Or like an idle thresher with a flail,<br>
Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.<br>
I cheer&#8217;d them up with justice of our cause,<br>
With promise of high pay and great rewards:<br>
But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,<br>
And we in them no hope to win the day;<br>
So that we fled; the king unto the queen;<br>
Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,<br>
In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:<br>
For in the marches here we heard you were,<br>
Making another head to fight again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?<br>
And when came George from Burgundy to England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Some six miles off the duke is with the
soldiers;<br>
And for your brother, he was lately sent<br>
From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,<br>
With aid of soldiers to this needful war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick
fled:<br>
Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,<br>
But ne&#8217;er till now his scandal of retire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;<br>
For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine<br>
Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry&#8217;s head,<br>
And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,<br>
Were he as famous and as bold in war<br>
As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:<br>
&#8217;Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.<br>
But in this troublous time what&#8217;s to be done?<br>
Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,<br>
And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,<br>
Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?<br>
Or shall we on the helmets of our foes<br>
Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?<br>
If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;<br>
And therefore comes my brother Montague.<br>
Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,<br>
With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,<br>
And of their feather many more proud birds,<br>
Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.<br>
He swore consent to your succession,<br>
His oath enrolled in the parliament;<br>
And now to London all the crew are gone,<br>
To frustrate both his oath and what beside<br>
May make against the house of Lancaster.<br>
Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:<br>
Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,<br>
With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,<br>
Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,<br>
Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,<br>
Why, Via! to London will we march amain,<br>
And once again bestride our foaming steeds,<br>
And once again cry &#8216;Charge upon our foes!&#8217;<br>
But never once again turn back and fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:<br>
Ne&#8217;er may he live to see a sunshine day,<br>
That cries &#8216;Retire,&#8217; if Warwick bid him stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;<br>
And when thou fail&#8217;st&#8212;as God forbid the
hour!&#8212;<br>
Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:<br>
The next degree is England&#8217;s royal throne;<br>
For King of England shalt thou be proclaim&#8217;d<br>
In every borough as we pass along;<br>
And he that throws not up his cap for joy<br>
Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.<br>
King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,<br>
Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,<br>
But sound the trumpets, and about our task.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as
steel,<br>
As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,<br>
I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for
us!</p>

VI, Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, Clifford, and Northumberland,
with drum and trumpets</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.<br>
Yonder&#8217;s the head of that arch-enemy<br>
That sought to be encompass&#8217;d with your crown:<br>
Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their
wreck:<br>
To see this sight, it irks my very soul.<br>
Withhold revenge, dear God! &#8217;tis not my fault,<br>
Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious liege, this too much lenity<br>
And harmful pity must be laid aside.<br>
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?<br>
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.<br>
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?<br>
Not his that spoils her young before her face.<br>
Who &#8217;scapes the lurking serpent&#8217;s mortal sting?<br>
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.<br>
The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,<br>
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.<br>
Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,<br>
Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:<br>
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,<br>
And raise his issue, like a loving sire;<br>
Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,<br>
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,<br>
Which argued thee a most unloving father.<br>
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;<br>
And though man&#8217;s face be fearful to their eyes,<br>
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,<br>
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings<br>
Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,<br>
Make war with him that climb&#8217;d unto their nest,<br>
Offer their own lives in their young&#8217;s defence?<br>
For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!<br>
Were it not pity that this goodly boy<br>
Should lose his birthright by his father&#8217;s fault,<br>
And long hereafter say unto his child,<br>
&#8216;What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got<br>
My careless father fondly gave away&#8217;?<br>
Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;<br>
And let his manly face, which promiseth<br>
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart<br>
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Full well hath Clifford play&#8217;d the
orator,<br>
Inferring arguments of mighty force.<br>
But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear<br>
That things ill-got had ever bad success?<br>
And happy always was it for that son<br>
Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?<br>
I&#8217;ll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;<br>
And would my father had left me no more!<br>
For all the rest is held at such a rate<br>
As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep<br>
Than in possession and jot of pleasure.<br>
Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know<br>
How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are
nigh,<br>
And this soft courage makes your followers faint.<br>
You promised knighthood to our forward son:<br>
Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.<br>
Edward, kneel down.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>

I&#8217;ll draw it as apparent to the crown,<br>

Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms<br>
Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">I am his king, and he should bow his knee;<br>
I was adopted heir by his consent:<br>
Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,<br>
You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,<br>
Have caused him, by new act of parliament,<br>
To blot out me, and put his own son in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>

speak?<br>
When you and I met at Saint Alban&#8217;s last,<br>
Your legs did better service than your hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Then &#8217;twas my turn to fly, and now

<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">You said so much before, and yet you fled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me
thence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor your manhood that durst make you
stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.<br>
Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain<br>
The execution of my big-swoln heart<br>
Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">I slew thy father, call&#8217;st thou him a
child?</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,<br>
As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;<br>
But ere sunset I&#8217;ll make thee curse the deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Have done with words, my lords, and hear me
speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>

<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:<br>
I am a king, and privileged to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, the wound that bred this meeting
here<br>
Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:<br>
By him that made us all, I am resolved<br>
That Clifford&#8217;s manhood lies upon his tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?<br>
A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,<br>
That ne&#8217;er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;<br>
For York in justice puts his armour on.</p>

There is no wrong, but every thing is right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;<br>
For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother&#8217;s tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;<br>
But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,<br>
Mark&#8217;d by the destinies to be avoided,<br>
As venom toads, or lizards&#8217; dreadful stings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,<br>
Whose father bears the title of a king,&#8212;<br>
As if a channel should be call&#8217;d the sea,&#8212;<br>
Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,<br>
To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,<br>
To make this shameless callet know herself.<br>
Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,<br>
Although thy husband may be Menelaus;<br>
And ne&#8217;er was Agamemnon&#8217;s brother wrong&#8217;d<br>
By that false woman, as this king by thee.<br>
His father revell&#8217;d in the heart of France,<br>
And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;<br>
And had he match&#8217;d according to his state,<br>
He might have kept that glory to this day;<br>
But when he took a beggar to his bed,<br>
And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,<br>
Even then that sunshine brew&#8217;d a shower for him,<br>

Can neither call it perfect day nor night.<br>
Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea<br>
Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;<br>
Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea<br>
Forced to retire by fury of the wind:<br>
Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;<br>
Now one the better, then another best;<br>
Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,<br>
Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:<br>
So is the equal of this fell war.<br>
Here on this molehill will I sit me down.<br>
To whom God will, there be the victory!<br>
For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,<br>
Have chid me from the battle; swearing both<br>
They prosper best of all when I am thence.<br>
Would I were dead! if God&#8217;s good will were so;<br>
For what is in this world but grief and woe?<br>
O God! methinks it were a happy life,<br>
To be no better than a homely swain;<br>
To sit upon a hill, as I do now,<br>

So many hours must I take my rest;<br>

So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:<br>
So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:<br>
So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,<br>

Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.<br>

To kings that fear their subjects&#8217; treachery?<br>
O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.<br>

So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;<br>

To wife for Edward: if this news be true,<br>
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;<br>
For Warwick is a subtle orator,<br>
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.<br>
By this account then Margaret may win him;<br>
For she&#8217;s a woman to be pitied much:<br>
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;<br>
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;<br>
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;<br>
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,<br>
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.<br>
Ay, but she&#8217;s come to beg, Warwick to give;<br>
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,<br>
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.<br>
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;<br>
He smiles, and says his Edward is install&#8217;d;<br>
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;<br>
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,<br>
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,<br>
And in conclusion wins the king from her,<br>
With promise of his sister, and what else,<br>
To strengthen and support King Edward&#8217;s place.<br>
O Margaret, thus &#8217;twill be; and thou, poor soul,<br>
Art then forsaken, as thou went&#8217;st forlorn!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Say, what art thou that talk&#8217;st of kings
and queens?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">More than I seem, and less than I was born
to:<br>
A man at least, for less I should not be;<br>
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but thou talk&#8217;st as if thou wert a
king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I am, in mind; and that&#8217;s
enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My crown is in my heart, not on my head;<br>
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,<br>
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:<br>
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if you be a king crown&#8217;d with
content,<br>
Your crown content and you must be contented<br>
To go along with us; for as we think,<br>
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;<br>
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance<br>
Will apprehend you as his enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">But did you never swear, and break an oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you dwell when I was King of
England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Here in this country, where we now remain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I was anointed king at nine months old;<br>
My father and my grandfather were kings,<br>
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:<br>
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">No;<br>
For we were subjects but while you were king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?<br>
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!<br>
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,<br>
And as the air blows it to me again,<br>
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,<br>
And yielding to another when it blows,<br>
Commanded always by the greater gust;<br>
Such is the lightness of you common men.<br>
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin<br>
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.<br>
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;<br>
And be you kings, command, and I&#8217;ll obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">We are true subjects to the king, King
Edward.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">So would you be again to Henry,<br>
If he were seated as King Edward is.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">We charge you, in God&#8217;s name, and the
king&#8217;s,<br>
To go with us unto the officers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, lead; your king&#8217;s name
be obey&#8217;d:<br>
And what God will, that let your king perform;<br>
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.</p>

This lady&#8217;s husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,<br>
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:<br>
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;<br>
Which we in justice cannot well deny,<br>

The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your highness shall do well to grant her

It were dishonour to deny it her.</p>

<p class="speech">Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, give us leave: I&#8217;ll try this
widow&#8217;s wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">And would you not do much to do them good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">To do them good, I would sustain some harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Then get your husband&#8217;s lands, to do them
good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore I came unto your majesty.</p>

<p class="speech">No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.<br>
What love, think&#8217;st thou, I sue so much to get?</p>

That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">But now you partly may perceive my mind.</p>

<p class="speech">My mind will never grant what I perceive<br>
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>

Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,<br>
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,<br>
To cross me from the golden time I look for!<br>
And yet, between my soul&#8217;s desire and me&#8212;<br>
The lustful Edward&#8217;s title buried&#8212;<br>
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,<br>
And all the unlook&#8217;d for issue of their bodies,<br>
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:<br>
A cold premeditation for my purpose!<br>
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;<br>
Like one that stands upon a promontory,<br>
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,<br>
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,<br>
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,<br>
Saying, he&#8217;ll lade it dry to have his way:<br>
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;<br>
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;<br>
And so I say, I&#8217;ll cut the causes off,<br>
Flattering me with impossibilities.<br>
My eye&#8217;s too quick, my heart o&#8217;erweens too much,<br>
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.<br>
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;<br>
What other pleasure can the world afford?<br>
I&#8217;ll make my heaven in a lady&#8217;s lap,<br>
And deck my body in gay ornaments,<br>
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.<br>
O miserable thought! and more unlikely<br>
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!<br>
Why, love forswore me in my mother&#8217;s womb:<br>
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,<br>
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,<br>
To shrink mine arm up like a wither&#8217;d shrub;<br>
To make an envious mountain on my back,<br>
Where sits deformity to mock my body;<br>
To shape my legs of an unequal size;<br>
To disproportion me in every part,<br>
Like to a chaos, or an unlick&#8217;d bear-whelp<br>
That carries no impression like the dam.<br>
And am I then a man to be beloved?<br>
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!<br>
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,<br>
But to command, to cheque, to o&#8217;erbear such<br>
As are of better person than myself,<br>
I&#8217;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,<br>
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,<br>
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head<br>
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.<br>
And yet I know not how to get the crown,<br>
For many lives stand between me and home:<br>
And I,&#8212;like one lost in a thorny wood,<br>
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,<br>
Seeking a way and straying from the way;<br>
Not knowing how to find the open air,<br>
But toiling desperately to find it out,&#8212;<br>
Torment myself to catch the English crown:<br>
And from that torment I will free myself,<br>
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.<br>
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,<br>
And cry &#8216;Content&#8217; to that which grieves my heart,<br>
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,<br>
And frame my face to all occasions.<br>
I&#8217;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;<br>
I&#8217;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;<br>
I&#8217;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,<br>
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,<br>
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.<br>
I can add colours to the chameleon,<br>
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,<br>
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.<br>
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?<br>
Tut, were it farther off, I&#8217;ll pluck it down.</p>

And then to crave a league of amity;<br>
And lastly, to confirm that amity<br>
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant<br>
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,<br>
To England&#8217;s king in lawful marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If that go
forward, Henry&#8217;s hope is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Bona]</span> And,
gracious madam, in our king&#8217;s behalf,<br>
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,<br>
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue<br>
To tell the passion of my sovereign&#8217;s heart;<br>
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,<br>
Hath placed thy beauty&#8217;s image and thy virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,<br>
Before you answer Warwick. His demand<br>
Springs not from Edward&#8217;s well-meant honest love,<br>
But from deceit bred by necessity;<br>
For how can tyrants safely govern home,<br>
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?<br>
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,<br>
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,<br>
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry&#8217;s son.<br>
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage<br>
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;<br>
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,<br>
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Injurious Margaret!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">And why not queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Because thy father Henry did usurp;<br>
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,<br>
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;<br>
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,<br>
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;<br>
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,<br>
Who by his prowess conquered all France:<br>
From these our Henry lineally descends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth
discourse,<br>
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost<br>
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?<br>
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.<br>
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree<br>
Of threescore and two years; a silly time<br>
To make prescription for a kingdom&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy
liege,<br>
Whom thou obeyed&#8217;st thirty and six years,<br>
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,<br>
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?<br>
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Call him my king by whose injurious doom<br>
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,<br>
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,<br>
Even in the downfall of his mellow&#8217;d years,<br>
When nature brought him to the door of death?<br>
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,<br>
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And I the house of York.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,<br>
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,<br>
While I use further conference with Warwick.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They stand aloof</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens grant that Warwick&#8217;s words bewitch
him not!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy
conscience,<br>
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath<br>
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">But is he gracious in the people&#8217;s eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">The more that Henry was unfortunate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then further, all dissembling set aside,<br>
Tell me for truth the measure of his love<br>
Unto our sister Bona.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Such it seems<br>
As may beseem a monarch like himself.<br>
Myself have often heard him say and swear<br>
That this his love was an eternal plant,<br>
Whereof the root was fix&#8217;d in virtue&#8217;s ground,<br>
The leaves and fruit maintain&#8217;d with beauty&#8217;s sun,<br>
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,<br>
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yet I confess that often ere this day,<br>
When I have heard your king&#8217;s desert recounted,<br>
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be
Edward&#8217;s;<br>
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn<br>
Touching the jointure that your king must make,<br>
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.<br>
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness<br>
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">To Edward, but not to the English king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device<br>
By this alliance to make void my suit:<br>
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry&#8217;s friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">And still is friend to him and Margaret:<br>
But if your title to the crown be weak,<br>
As may appear by Edward&#8217;s good success,<br>
Then &#8217;tis but reason that I be released<br>
From giving aid which late I promised.<br>
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand<br>
That your estate requires and mine can yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,<br>
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.<br>
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,<br>
You have a father able to maintain you;<br>
And better &#8217;twere you troubled him than France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,<br>
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!<br>
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,<br>
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold<br>
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord&#8217;s false love;<br>
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</p>

<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were
nettled:<br>
I hope all&#8217;s for the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair
queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped
joys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, full of sorrow and heart&#8217;s
discontent.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">What! has your king married the Lady Grey!<br>
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,<br>
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?<br>
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?<br>
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I told your majesty as much before:<br>
This proveth Edward&#8217;s love and Warwick&#8217;s honesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of
heaven,<br>
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,<br>
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward&#8217;s,<br>
No more my king, for he dishonours me,<br>
But most himself, if he could see his shame.<br>
Did I forget that by the house of York<br>
My father came untimely to his death?<br>
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?<br>
Did I impale him with the regal crown?<br>
Did I put Henry from his native right?<br>
And am I guerdon&#8217;d at the last with shame?<br>
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:<br>
And to repair my honour lost for him,<br>
I here renounce him and return to Henry.<br>
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,<br>
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:<br>
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,<br>
And replant Henry in his former state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Warwick, these words have turn&#8217;d my hate to
love;<br>
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,<br>
And joy that thou becomest King Henry&#8217;s friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,<br>
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us<br>
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,<br>
I&#8217;ll undertake to land them on our coast<br>
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.<br>
&#8217;Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:<br>
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,<br>
He&#8217;s very likely now to fall from him,<br>
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,<br>
Or than for strength and safety of our country.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged<br>
But by thy help to this distressed queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,<br>
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">My quarrel and this English queen&#8217;s are
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">And mine with hers, and thine, and
Margaret&#8217;s.<br>
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved<br>
You shall have aid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then, England&#8217;s messenger, return in
post,<br>
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,<br>
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers<br>
To revel it with him and his new bride:<br>
Thou seest what&#8217;s past, go fear thy king withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>

<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,<br>

There&#8217;s thy reward: be gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Post</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>

Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,<br>

And, as occasion serves, this noble queen<br>
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.<br>
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,<br>
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">This shall assure my constant loyalty,<br>
That if our queen and this young prince agree,<br>
I&#8217;ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy<br>
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.<br>
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,<br>
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;<br>
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,<br>
That only Warwick&#8217;s daughter shall be thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;<br>
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He gives his hand to
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be
levied,<br>
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,<br>
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.<br>
I long till Edward fall by war&#8217;s mischance,<br>
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">I came from Edward as ambassador,<br>
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:<br>
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,<br>
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.<br>
Had he none else to make a stale but me?<br>
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.<br>
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be chief to bring him down again:<br>
Not that I pity Henry&#8217;s misery,<br>
But seek revenge on Edward&#8217;s mockery.</p>

That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of
Warwick,<br>
Which are so weak of courage and in judgment<br>
That they&#8217;ll take no offence at our abuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Suppose they take offence without a cause,<br>
They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,<br>
Your king and Warwick&#8217;s, and must have my will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">And shall have your will, because our king:<br>
Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Not I:<br>
No, God forbid that I should wish them sever&#8217;d<br>
Whom God hath join&#8217;d together; ay, and &#8217;twere pity<br>
To sunder them that yoke so well together.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,<br>
Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey<br>
Should not become my wife and England&#8217;s queen.<br>
And you too, Somerset and Montague,<br>
Speak freely what you think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis<br>
Becomes your enemy, for mocking him<br>
About the marriage of the Lady Bona.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,<br>
Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased<br>
By such invention as I can devise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Yet, to have join&#8217;d with France in such
alliance<br>
Would more have strengthen&#8217;d this our commonwealth<br>

<p class="speech">Why, knows not Montague that of itself<br>
England is safe, if true within itself?</p>

France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis better using France than trusting
France:<br>
Let us be back&#8217;d with God and with the seas<br>
Which He hath given for fence impregnable,<br>
And with their helps only defend ourselves;<br>
In them and in ourselves our safety lies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">For this one speech Lord Hastings well

To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;<br>
And for this once my will shall stand for law.</p>

I mean, in bearing weight of government,<br>

My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;<br>
I have not been desirous of their wealth,<br>
Nor much oppress&#8217;d them with great subsidies.<br>
Nor forward of revenge, though they much err&#8217;d:<br>

His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,<br>
His statutes cancell&#8217;d and his treasure spent;<br>

The owl shriek&#8217;d at thy birth,&#8212;an evil sign;<br>

Dogs howl&#8217;d, and hideous tempest shook down trees;<br>
The raven rook&#8217;d her on the chimney&#8217;s top,<br>
And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.<br>
Thy mother felt more than a mother&#8217;s pain,<br>
And, yet brought forth less than a mother&#8217;s hope,<br>
To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,<br>
Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.<br>

O, may such purple tears be alway shed<br>
From those that wish the downfall of our house!<br>
If any spark of life be yet remaining,<br>
Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:</p>

<p class="speech">I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.<br>

I came into the world with my legs forward:<br>
Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,<br>
And seek their ruin that usurp&#8217;d our right?<br>
The midwife wonder&#8217;d and the women cried<br>
&#8216;O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!&#8217;<br>
And so I was; which plainly signified<br>
That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.<br>
Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,<br>
Let hell make crook&#8217;d my mind to answer it.<br>
I have no brother, I am like no brother;<br>
And this word &#8216;love,&#8217; which graybeards call divine,<br>
Be resident in men like one another<br>
And not in me: I am myself alone.<br>
Clarence, beware; thou keep&#8217;st me from the light:<br>
But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;<br>
For I will buz abroad such prophecies<br>
That Edward shall be fearful of his life,<br>
And then, to purge his fear, I&#8217;ll be thy death.<br>
King Henry and the prince his son are gone:<br>
Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,<br>
Counting myself but bad till I be best.<br>
I&#8217;ll throw thy body in another room<br>
