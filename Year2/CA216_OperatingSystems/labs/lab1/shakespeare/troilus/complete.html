<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<p class="speech">In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of
Greece<br>
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,<br>
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,<br>
Fraught with the ministers and instruments<br>
Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore<br>
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay<br>
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made<br>
To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures<br>
The ravish&#8217;d Helen, Menelaus&#8217; queen,<br>
With wanton Paris sleeps; and that&#8217;s the quarrel.<br>
To Tenedos they come;<br>
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge<br>
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains<br>
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch<br>
Their brave pavilions: Priam&#8217;s six-gated city,<br>
Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,<br>
And Antenorides, with massy staples<br>
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,<br>
Sperr up the sons of Troy.<br>
Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,<br>
On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,<br>
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come<br>
A prologue arm&#8217;d, but not in confidence<br>
Of author&#8217;s pen or actor&#8217;s voice, but suited<br>
In like conditions as our argument,<br>
To tell you, fair beholders, that our play<br>
Leaps o&#8217;er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,<br>
Beginning in the middle, starting thence away<br>
To what may be digested in a play.<br>
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:<br>
Now good or bad, &#8217;tis but the chance of war.</p>

<h4>Scene I. Troy. Before Priam&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Troilus armed, and
Pandarus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Call here my varlet; I&#8217;ll unarm again:<br>
Why should I war without the walls of Troy,<br>
That find such cruel battle here within?<br>
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,<br>
Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Will this gear ne&#8217;er be mended?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">The Greeks are strong and skilful to their
strength,<br>
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;<br>
But I am weaker than a woman&#8217;s tear,<br>
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,<br>
Less valiant than the virgin in the night<br>
And skilless as unpractised infancy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I have told you enough of this: for my
part,
I&#8217;ll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not tarried?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
the bolting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not tarried?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the
leavening.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Still have I tarried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to the leavening; but here&#8217;s yet in the
word
&#8216;hereafter&#8217; the kneading, the making of the cake,
the
heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Patience herself, what goddess e&#8217;er she
be,<br>
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.<br>
At Priam&#8217;s royal table do I sit;<br>
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,&#8212;<br>
So, traitor! &#8216;When she comes!&#8217; When is she thence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I
saw
her look, or any woman else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I was about to tell thee:&#8212;when my
heart,<br>
As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,<br>
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,<br>
I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,<br>
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:<br>
But sorrow, that is couch&#8217;d in seeming gladness,<br>
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">An her hair were not somewhat darker than
Helen&#8217;s&#8212;
well, go to&#8212;there were no more comparison between
the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
will not dispraise your sister Cassandra&#8217;s wit,
but&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,&#8212;<br>
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown&#8217;d,<br>
Reply not in how many fathoms deep<br>
They lie indrench&#8217;d. I tell thee I am mad<br>
In Cressid&#8217;s love: thou answer&#8217;st &#8216;she is
fair;&#8217;<br>
Pour&#8217;st in the open ulcer of my heart<br>
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<br>
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,<br>
In whose comparison all whites are ink,<br>
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure<br>
The cygnet&#8217;s down is harsh and spirit of sense<br>
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell&#8217;st me,<br>
As true thou tell&#8217;st me, when I say I love her;<br>
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<br>
Thou lay&#8217;st in every gash that love hath given me<br>
The knife that made it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I speak no more than truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost not speak so much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I&#8217;ll not meddle in&#8217;t. Let her
be as she is:
if she be fair, &#8217;tis the better for her; an she be
not, she has the mends in her own hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought
on of
her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
between, but small thanks for my labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Because she&#8217;s kin to me, therefore
she&#8217;s not so fair
as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; &#8217;tis all one to
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Say I she is not fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I do not care whether you do or no. She&#8217;s a
fool to
stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
I&#8217;ll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
I&#8217;ll meddle nor make no more i&#8217; the matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Pandarus,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Pandarus,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all
as I
found it, and there an end.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Pandarus. An
alarum</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude
sounds!<br>
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,<br>
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.<br>
I cannot fight upon this argument;<br>
It is too starved a subject for my sword.<br>
But Pandarus,&#8212;O gods, how do you plague me!<br>
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;<br>
And he&#8217;s as tetchy to be woo&#8217;d to woo.<br>
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.<br>
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne&#8217;s love,<br>
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?<br>
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:<br>
Between our Ilium and where she resides,<br>
Let it be call&#8217;d the wild and wandering flood,<br>
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar<br>
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Enter
Aeneas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not
afield?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Because not there: this woman&#8217;s answer
sorts,<br>
For womanish it is to be from thence.<br>
What news, Aeneas, from the field to-day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">That Paris is returned home and hurt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">By whom, Aeneas?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Troilus, by Menelaus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Let Paris bleed; &#8217;tis but a scar to
scorn;<br>
Paris is gored with Menelaus&#8217; horn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Better at home, if &#8216;would I might&#8217;
were &#8216;may.&#8217;<br>
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">In all swift haste.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The Same. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cressida and
Alexander</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Who were those went by?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">Queen Hecuba and Helen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">And whither go they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">Up to the eastern tower,<br>
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,<br>
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience<br>
Is, as a virtue, fix&#8217;d, to-day was moved:<br>
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,<br>
And, like as there were husbandry in war,<br>
Before the sun rose he was harness&#8217;d light,<br>
And to the field goes he; where every flower<br>
Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw<br>
In Hector&#8217;s wrath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What was his cause of anger?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">The noise goes, this: there is among the
Greeks<br>
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;<br>
They call him Ajax.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Good; and what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">They say he is a very man per se,<br>
And stands alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or
have no legs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of
their
particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">But how should this man, that makes
me smile, make Hector angry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle
and
struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Who comes here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pandarus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Hector&#8217;s a gallant man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexander</p>
<p class="speech">As may be in the world, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that? what&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk
of?
Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
were you at Ilium?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">This morning, uncle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">What were you talking of when I came? Was
Hector
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
up, was she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Even so: Hector was stirring early.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">That were we talking of, and of his anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Was he angry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">So he says here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">True, he was so: I know the cause too:
he&#8217;ll lay
about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there&#8217;s
Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">What, is he angry too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the
two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">O Jupiter! there&#8217;s no comparison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know
a
man if you see him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not
Hector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some
degrees.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis just to each of them; he is
himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">So he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">He is not Hector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Himself! no, he&#8217;s not himself: would
a&#8217; were
himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Excuse me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">He is elder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Th&#8217; other&#8217;s not come to&#8217;t; you
shall tell me another
tale, when th&#8217; other&#8217;s come to&#8217;t. Hector shall
not
have his wit this year.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">He shall not need it, if he have his own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Nor his qualities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">No matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Nor his beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twould not become him; his own&#8217;s
better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">You have no judgment, niece: Helen
herself swore th&#8217; other day, that Troilus, for
a brown favour&#8212;for so &#8217;tis, I must confess,&#8212;
not brown neither,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">No, but brown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, to say truth, brown and not
brown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">To say the truth, true and not true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">She praised his complexion above Paris.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Paris hath colour enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">So he has.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Then Troilus should have too much: if she
praised
him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
lief Helen&#8217;s golden tongue had commended Troilus for
a copper nose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better
than Paris.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Then she&#8217;s a merry Greek indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him
th&#8217; other
day into the compassed window,&#8212;and, you know, he
has not past three or four hairs on his chin,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, a tapster&#8217;s arithmetic may soon
bring his
particulars therein to a total.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he is very young: and yet will he,
within
three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she
came
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you know &#8217;tis dimpled: I think his
smiling
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">O, he smiles valiantly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Does he not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">O yes, an &#8217;twere a cloud in autumn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that
Helen
loves Troilus,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Troilus will stand to the proof, if
you&#8217;ll
prove it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I
esteem
an addle egg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">If you love an addle egg as well as you love an
idle
head, you would eat chickens i&#8217; the shell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she
tickled
his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
must needs confess,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Without the rack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his
chin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba
laughed
that her eyes ran o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">With mill-stones.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">And Cassandra laughed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">But there was more temperate fire under the pot
of
her eyes: did her eyes run o&#8217;er too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">And Hector laughed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">At what was all this laughing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on
Troilus&#8217; chin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t had been a green hair, I should have
laughed
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">They laughed not so much at the hair as at his
pretty answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">What was his answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Quoth she, &#8216;Here&#8217;s but two and fifty
hairs on your
chin, and one of them is white.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">This is her question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s true; make no question of that.
&#8216;Two and
fifty hairs&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;and one white: that white
hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.&#8217;
&#8216;Jupiter!&#8217; quoth she, &#8216;which of these hairs is
Paris,
my husband? &#8216;The forked one,&#8217; quoth he,
&#8216;pluck&#8217;t
out, and give it him.&#8217; But there was such laughing!
and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
rest so laughed, that it passed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">So let it now; for it has been while going
by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think
on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">So I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be sworn &#8217;tis true; he will weep
you, an &#8217;twere
a man born in April.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll spring up in his tears, an
&#8217;twere a nettle
against May.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A retreat sounded</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Hark! they are coming from the field: shall
we
stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">At your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Here, here, here&#8217;s an excellent place; here
we may
see most bravely: I&#8217;ll tell you them all by their
names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Speak not so loud.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aeneas passes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s Aeneas: is not that a brave man?
he&#8217;s one of
the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
Troilus; you shall see anon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Antenor passes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can
tell you;
and he&#8217;s a man good enough, he&#8217;s one o&#8217; the
soundest
judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
When comes Troilus? I&#8217;ll show you Troilus anon: if
he see me, you shall see him nod at me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Will he give you the nod?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">You shall see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">If he do, the rich shall have more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hector passes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s Hector, that, that, look you, that;
there&#8217;s a
fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There&#8217;s a brave man,
niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there&#8217;s
a countenance! is&#8217;t not a brave man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">O, a brave man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Is a&#8217; not? it does a man&#8217;s heart
good. Look you
what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
you see? look you there: there&#8217;s no jesting;
there&#8217;s laying on, take&#8217;t off who will, as they
say:
there be hacks!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Be those with swords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil
come
to him, it&#8217;s all one: by God&#8217;s lid, it does
one&#8217;s
heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Paris passes</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look ye yonder, niece; is&#8217;t not a gallant
man too,
is&#8217;t not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
hurt home to-day? he&#8217;s not hurt: why, this will do
Helen&#8217;s heart good now, ha! Would I could see
Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Helenus passes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is.
That&#8217;s<br>
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That&#8217;s
Helenus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Can Helenus fight, uncle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Helenus? no. Yes, he&#8217;ll fight indifferent
well. I
marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
people cry &#8216;Troilus&#8217;? Helenus is a priest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">What sneaking fellow comes yonder?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Troilus passes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Where? yonder? that&#8217;s Deiphobus. &#8217;Tis
Troilus!
there&#8217;s a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
prince of chivalry!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, for shame, peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well
upon
him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
his helm more hacked than Hector&#8217;s, and how he looks,
and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne&#8217;er saw
three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
change, would give an eye to boot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Here come more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Forces pass</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and
bran!
porridge after meat! I could live and die i&#8217; the
eyes of Troilus. Ne&#8217;er look, ne&#8217;er look: the eagles
are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
all Greece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man
than Troilus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Well, well!&#8217; why, have you any
discretion? have
you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no
date
in the pie, for then the man&#8217;s date&#8217;s out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward
you
lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit,
to
defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
thousand watches.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Say one of your watches.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll watch you for that; and
that&#8217;s one of the
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it&#8217;s
past watching.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">You are such another!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Troilus&#8217;s
Boy</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Boy</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Where?</p>
<p class="speaker">Boy</p>
<p class="speech">At your own house; there he unarms him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Good boy, tell him I come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit boy</span></p>
<p class="speech">I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, uncle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be with you, niece, by and by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">To bring, uncle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, a token from Troilus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">By the same token, you are a bawd.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Pandarus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love&#8217;s full
sacrifice,<br>
He offers in another&#8217;s enterprise;<br>
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see<br>
Than in the glass of Pandar&#8217;s praise may be;<br>
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:<br>
Things won are done; joy&#8217;s soul lies in the doing.<br>
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:<br>
Men prize the thing ungain&#8217;d more than it is:<br>
That she was never yet that ever knew<br>
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.<br>
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:<br>
Achievement is command; ungain&#8217;d, beseech:<br>
Then though my heart&#8217;s content firm love doth bear,<br>
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</p>

<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Princes,<br>
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?<br>
The ample proposition that hope makes<br>
In all designs begun on earth below<br>
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters<br>
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear&#8217;d,<br>
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,<br>
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain<br>
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.<br>
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us<br>
That we come short of our suppose so far<br>
That after seven years&#8217; siege yet Troy walls stand;<br>
Sith every action that hath gone before,<br>
Whereof we have record, trial did draw<br>
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,<br>
And that unbodied figure of the thought<br>
That gave&#8217;t surmised shape. Why then, you princes,<br>
Do you with cheeks abash&#8217;d behold our works,<br>
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else<br>
But the protractive trials of great Jove<br>
To find persistive constancy in men:<br>
The fineness of which metal is not found<br>
In fortune&#8217;s love; for then the bold and coward,<br>
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,<br>
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:<br>
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,<br>
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,<br>
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;<br>
And what hath mass or matter, by itself<br>
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">With due observance of thy godlike seat,<br>
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply<br>
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance<br>
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,<br>
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail<br>
Upon her patient breast, making their way<br>
With those of nobler bulk!<br>
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage<br>
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold<br>
The strong-ribb&#8217;d bark through liquid mountains cut,<br>
Bounding between the two moist elements,<br>
Like Perseus&#8217; horse: where&#8217;s then the saucy boat<br>
Whose weak untimber&#8217;d sides but even now<br>
Co-rivall&#8217;d greatness? Either to harbour fled,<br>
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so<br>
Doth valour&#8217;s show and valour&#8217;s worth divide<br>
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness<br>
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze<br>
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind<br>
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,<br>
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage<br>
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,<br>
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key<br>
Retorts to chiding fortune.</p>

I give to both your speeches, which were such<br>
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece<br>
Should hold up high in brass, and such again<br>
As venerable Nestor, hatch&#8217;d in silver,<br>
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree<br>
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears<br>
To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,<br>
Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be&#8217;t of less
expect<br>
That matter needless, of importless burden,<br>
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,<br>
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,<br>
We shall hear music, wit and oracle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,<br>
And the great Hector&#8217;s sword had lack&#8217;d a master,<br>
But for these instances.<br>
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:<br>
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand<br>
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.<br>
When that the general is not like the hive<br>
To whom the foragers shall all repair,<br>
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,<br>
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.<br>
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre<br>
Observe degree, priority and place,<br>
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,<br>
Office and custom, in all line of order;<br>
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol<br>
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered<br>
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye<br>
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,<br>
And posts, like the commandment of a king,<br>
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets<br>
In evil mixture to disorder wander,<br>
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!<br>
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!<br>
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,<br>
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate<br>
The unity and married calm of states<br>
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,<br>
Which is the ladder to all high designs,<br>
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,<br>
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,<br>
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,<br>
The primogenitive and due of birth,<br>
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,<br>
But by degree, stand in authentic place?<br>
Take but degree away, untune that string,<br>
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets<br>
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters<br>
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores<br>
And make a sop of all this solid globe:<br>
Strength should be lord of imbecility,<br>
And the rude son should strike his father dead:<br>
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,<br>
Between whose endless jar justice resides,<br>
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.<br>
Then every thing includes itself in power,<br>
Power into will, will into appetite;<br>
And appetite, an universal wolf,<br>
So doubly seconded with will and power,<br>
Must make perforce an universal prey,<br>
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,<br>
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,<br>
Follows the choking.<br>
And this neglection of degree it is<br>
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose<br>
It hath to climb. The general&#8217;s disdain&#8217;d<br>
By him one step below, he by the next,<br>
That next by him beneath; so every step,<br>
Exampled by the first pace that is sick<br>
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever<br>
Of pale and bloodless emulation:<br>
And &#8217;tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,<br>
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,<br>
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Most wisely hath Ulysses here
discover&#8217;d<br>
The fever whereof all our power is sick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,<br>
What is the remedy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns<br>
The sinew and the forehand of our host,<br>
Having his ear full of his airy fame,<br>
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent<br>
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus<br>
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day<br>
Breaks scurril jests;<br>
And with ridiculous and awkward action,<br>
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,<br>
He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,<br>
Thy topless deputation he puts on,<br>
And, like a strutting player, whose conceit<br>
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich<br>
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound<br>
&#8217;Twixt his stretch&#8217;d footing and the
scaffoldage,&#8212;<br>
Such to-be-pitied and o&#8217;er-wrested seeming<br>
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,<br>
&#8217;Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,<br>
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp&#8217;d<br>
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff<br>
The large Achilles, on his press&#8217;d bed lolling,<br>
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;<br>
Cries &#8216;Excellent! &#8217;tis Agamemnon just.<br>
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,<br>
As he being drest to some oration.&#8217;<br>
That&#8217;s done, as near as the extremest ends<br>
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:<br>
Yet god Achilles still cries &#8216;Excellent!<br>
&#8217;Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,<br>
Arming to answer in a night alarm.&#8217;<br>
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age<br>
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,<br>
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,<br>
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport<br>
Sir Valour dies; cries &#8216;O, enough, Patroclus;<br>
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all<br>
In pleasure of my spleen.&#8217; And in this fashion,<br>
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,<br>
Severals and generals of grace exact,<br>
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,<br>
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,<br>
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves<br>
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">And in the imitation of these twain&#8212;<br>
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns<br>
With an imperial voice&#8212;many are infect.<br>
Ajax is grown self-will&#8217;d, and bears his head<br>
In such a rein, in full as proud a place<br>
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;<br>
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,<br>
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,<br>
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,<br>
To match us in comparisons with dirt,<br>
To weaken and discredit our exposure,<br>
How rank soever rounded in with danger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,<br>
Count wisdom as no member of the war,<br>
Forestall prescience, and esteem no act<br>
But that of hand: the still and mental parts,<br>
That do contrive how many hands shall strike,<br>
When fitness calls them on, and know by measure<br>
Of their observant toil the enemies&#8217; weight,&#8212;<br>
Why, this hath not a finger&#8217;s dignity:<br>
They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;<br>
So that the ram that batters down the wall,<br>
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,<br>
They place before his hand that made the engine,<br>
Or those that with the fineness of their souls<br>
By reason guide his execution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Let this be granted, and Achilles&#8217;

<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">How!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Ay;<br>
I ask, that I might waken reverence,<br>
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush<br>
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes<br>
The youthful Phoebus:<br>
Which is that god in office, guiding men?<br>
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy<br>
Are ceremonious courtiers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Courtiers as free, as debonair,
unarm&#8217;d,<br>
As bending angels; that&#8217;s their fame in peace:<br>
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,<br>
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,<br>
Jove&#8217;s accord,<br>
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, Aeneas,<br>
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!<br>
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,<br>
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:<br>
But what the repining enemy commends,<br>
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
transcends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>

It is not Agamemnon&#8217;s sleeping hour:<br>
That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,<br>
He tells thee so himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Trumpet, blow loud,<br>
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;<br>
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpet sounds</span></p>
<p class="speech">We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy<br>
A prince call&#8217;d Hector,&#8212;Priam is his father,&#8212;<br>
Who in this dull and long-continued truce<br>
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,<br>
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!<br>
If there be one among the fair&#8217;st of Greece<br>
That holds his honour higher than his ease,<br>
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,<br>
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,<br>
That loves his mistress more than in confession,<br>
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,<br>
And dare avow her beauty and her worth<br>
In other arms than hers,&#8212;to him this challenge.<br>
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,<br>
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,<br>
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,<br>
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,<br>
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call<br>
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,<br>
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:<br>
If any come, Hector shall honour him;<br>
If none, he&#8217;ll say in Troy when he retires,<br>
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth<br>
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">This shall be told our lovers, Lord Aeneas;<br>
If none of them have soul in such a kind,<br>
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;<br>
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,<br>
That means not, hath not, or is not in love!<br>
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,<br>
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man<br>
When Hector&#8217;s grandsire suck&#8217;d: he is old now;<br>
But if there be not in our Grecian host<br>
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,<br>
To answer for his love, tell him from me<br>
I&#8217;ll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver<br>
And in my vantbrace put this wither&#8217;d brawn,<br>
And meeting him will tell him that my lady<br>
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste<br>
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,<br>
I&#8217;ll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Fair Lord Aeneas, let me touch your hand;<br>
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.<br>
Achilles shall have word of this intent;<br>
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:<br>
Yourself shall feast with us before you go<br>
And find the welcome of a noble foe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Ulysses and
Nestor</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Nestor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">What says Ulysses?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">I have a young conception in my brain;<br>
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">This &#8217;tis:<br>
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride<br>
That hath to this maturity blown up<br>
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp&#8217;d,<br>
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,<br>
To overbulk us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Well, and how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,<br>
However it is spread in general name,<br>
Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,<br>
Whose grossness little characters sum up:<br>
And, in the publication, make no strain,<br>
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren<br>
As banks of Libya,&#8212;though, Apollo knows,<br>
&#8217;Tis dry enough,&#8212;will, with great speed of
judgment,<br>
Ay, with celerity, find Hector&#8217;s purpose<br>
Pointing on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">And wake him to the answer, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, &#8217;tis most meet: whom may you else
oppose,<br>
That can from Hector bring his honour off,<br>
If not Achilles? Though&#8217;t be a sportful combat,<br>
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;<br>
For here the Trojans taste our dear&#8217;st repute<br>
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,<br>
Our imputation shall be oddly poised<br>
In this wild action; for the success,<br>
Although particular, shall give a scantling<br>
Of good or bad unto the general;<br>
And in such indexes, although small pricks<br>
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen<br>
The baby figure of the giant mass<br>
Of things to come at large. It is supposed<br>
He that meets Hector issues from our choice<br>
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,<br>
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,<br>
As &#8217;twere from us all, a man distill&#8217;d<br>
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,<br>
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,<br>
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?<br>
Which entertain&#8217;d, limbs are his instruments,<br>
In no less working than are swords and bows<br>
Directive by the limbs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Give pardon to my speech:<br>
Therefore &#8217;tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.<br>
Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,<br>
And think, perchance, they&#8217;ll sell; if not,<br>
The lustre of the better yet to show,<br>
Shall show the better. Do not consent<br>
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;<br>
For both our honour and our shame in this<br>
Are dogg&#8217;d with two strange followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">I see them not with my old eyes: what are
they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,<br>
Were he not proud, we all should share with him:<br>
But he already is too insolent;<br>
A nd we were better parch in Afric sun<br>
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,<br>
Should he &#8217;scape Hector fair: if he were foil&#8217;d,<br>
Why then, we did our main opinion crush<br>
In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;<br>
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw<br>
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves<br>
Give him allowance for the better man;<br>
For that will physic the great Myrmidon<br>
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall<br>
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.<br>
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,<br>
We&#8217;ll dress him up in voices: if he fail,<br>
Yet go we under our opinion still<br>
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,<br>
Our project&#8217;s life this shape of sense assumes:<br>
Ajax employ&#8217;d plucks down Achilles&#8217; plumes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nestor</p>
<p class="speech">Ulysses,<br>
Now I begin to relish thy advice;<br>
And I will give a taste of it forthwith<br>
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.<br>
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone<br>
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as &#8217;twere their bone.</p>

As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,<br>
Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed<br>
In hot digestion of this cormorant war&#8212;<br>
Shall be struck off.&#8217; Hector, what say you to&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I<br>
As far as toucheth my particular,<br>
Yet, dread Priam,<br>
There is no lady of more softer bowels,<br>
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,<br>
More ready to cry out &#8216;Who knows what follows?&#8217;<br>
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,<br>
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call&#8217;d<br>
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches<br>
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:<br>
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,<br>
Every tithe soul, &#8217;mongst many thousand dismes,<br>
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:<br>
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,<br>
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,<br>
Had it our name, the value of one ten,<br>
What merit&#8217;s in that reason which denies<br>
The yielding of her up?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie, my brother!<br>
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king<br>
So great as our dread father in a scale<br>
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum<br>
The past proportion of his infinite?<br>
And buckle in a waist most fathomless<br>
With spans and inches so diminutive<br>
As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helenus</p>
<p class="speech">No marvel, though you bite so sharp at
reasons,<br>
You are so empty of them. Should not our father<br>
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,<br>
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">You are for dreams and slumbers, brother
priest;<br>
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
your reasons:<br>
You know an enemy intends you harm;<br>
You know a sword employ&#8217;d is perilous,<br>
And reason flies the object of all harm:<br>
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds<br>
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set<br>
The very wings of reason to his heels<br>
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,<br>
Or like a star disorb&#8217;d? Nay, if we talk of reason,<br>
Let&#8217;s shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour<br>
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
their thoughts<br>
With this cramm&#8217;d reason: reason and respect<br>
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost<br>
The holding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What is aught, but as &#8217;tis
valued?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">But value dwells not in particular will;<br>
It holds his estimate and dignity<br>
As well wherein &#8217;tis precious of itself<br>
As in the prizer: &#8217;tis mad idolatry<br>
To make the service greater than the god<br>
And the will dotes that is attributive<br>
To what infectiously itself affects,<br>
Without some image of the affected merit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I take to-day a wife, and my election<br>
Is led on in the conduct of my will;<br>
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,<br>
Two traded pilots &#8217;twixt the dangerous shores<br>
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,<br>
Although my will distaste what it elected,<br>
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion<br>
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:<br>
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,<br>
When we have soil&#8217;d them, nor the remainder viands<br>
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,<br>
Because we now are full. It was thought meet<br>
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:<br>
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;<br>
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce<br>
And did him service: he touch&#8217;d the ports desired,<br>
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,<br>
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness<br>
Wrinkles Apollo&#8217;s, and makes stale the morning.<br>
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:<br>
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,<br>
Whose price hath launch&#8217;d above a thousand ships,<br>
And turn&#8217;d crown&#8217;d kings to merchants.<br>
If you&#8217;ll avouch &#8217;twas wisdom Paris went&#8212;<br>
As you must needs, for you all cried &#8216;Go,
go,&#8217;&#8212;<br>
If you&#8217;ll confess he brought home noble prize&#8212;<br>
As you must needs, for you all clapp&#8217;d your hands<br>
And cried &#8216;Inestimable!&#8217;&#8212;why do you now<br>
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,<br>
And do a deed that fortune never did,<br>
Beggar the estimation which you prized<br>
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,<br>
That we have stol&#8217;n what we do fear to keep!<br>
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol&#8217;n,<br>
That in their country did them that disgrace,<br>
We fear to warrant in our native place!</p>

<p class="speech">Peace, sister, peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassandra</p>
<p class="speech">Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,<br>
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,<br>
Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes<br>
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.<br>
Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!<br>
Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;<br>
Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.<br>
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:<br>
Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high
strains<br>
Of divination in our sister work<br>
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood<br>
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,<br>
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,<br>
Can qualify the same?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, brother Hector,<br>
We may not think the justness of each act<br>
Such and no other than event doth form it,<br>
Nor once deject the courage of our minds,<br>
Because Cassandra&#8217;s mad: her brain-sick raptures<br>
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel<br>
Which hath our several honours all engaged<br>
To make it gracious. For my private part,<br>
I am no more touch&#8217;d than all Priam&#8217;s sons:<br>
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us<br>
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen<br>
To fight for and maintain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Else might the world convince of levity<br>
As well my undertakings as your counsels:<br>
But I attest the gods, your full consent<br>
Gave wings to my propension and cut off<br>
All fears attending on so dire a project.<br>
For what, alas, can these my single arms?<br>
What Propugnation is in one man&#8217;s valour,<br>
To stand the push and enmity of those<br>
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,<br>
Were I alone to pass the difficulties<br>
And had as ample power as I have will,<br>
Paris should ne&#8217;er retract what he hath done,<br>
Nor faint in the pursuit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Priam</p>
<p class="speech">Paris, you speak<br>
Like one besotted on your sweet delights:<br>
You have the honey still, but these the gall;<br>
So to be valiant is no praise at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I propose not merely to myself<br>
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;<br>
But I would have the soil of her fair rape<br>
Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.<br>
What treason were it to the ransack&#8217;d queen,<br>
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,<br>
Now to deliver her possession up<br>
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be<br>
That so degenerate a strain as this<br>
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?<br>
There&#8217;s not the meanest spirit on our party<br>
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw<br>
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble<br>
Whose life were ill bestow&#8217;d or death unfamed<br>
Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,<br>
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,<br>
The world&#8217;s large spaces cannot parallel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,<br>
And on the cause and question now in hand<br>
Have glozed, but superficially: not much<br>
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought<br>
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:<br>
The reasons you allege do more conduce<br>
To the hot passion of distemper&#8217;d blood<br>
Than to make up a free determination<br>
&#8217;Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge<br>
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice<br>
Of any true decision. Nature craves<br>
All dues be render&#8217;d to their owners: now,<br>
What nearer debt in all humanity<br>
Than wife is to the husband? If this law<br>
Of nature be corrupted through affection,<br>
And that great minds, of partial indulgence<br>
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,<br>
There is a law in each well-order&#8217;d nation<br>
To curb those raging appetites that are<br>
Most disobedient and refractory.<br>
If Helen then be wife to Sparta&#8217;s king,<br>
As it is known she is, these moral laws<br>
Of nature and of nations speak aloud<br>
To have her back return&#8217;d: thus to persist<br>
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,<br>
But makes it much more heavy. Hector&#8217;s opinion<br>
Is this in way of truth; yet ne&#8217;ertheless,<br>
My spritely brethren, I propend to you<br>
In resolution to keep Helen still,<br>
For &#8217;tis a cause that hath no mean dependance<br>
Upon our joint and several dignities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there you touch&#8217;d the life of our
design:<br>
Were it not glory that we more affected<br>
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,<br>
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood<br>
Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,<br>
She is a theme of honour and renown,<br>
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,<br>
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,<br>
And fame in time to come canonize us;<br>
For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose<br>
So rich advantage of a promised glory<br>
As smiles upon the forehead of this action<br>
For the wide world&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">I am yours,<br>
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.<br>
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst<br>
The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks<br>
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:<br>
I was advertised their great general slept,<br>
Whilst emulation in the army crept:<br>
This, I presume, will wake him.</p>

of
thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
whilst he railed at me. &#8217;Sfoot, I&#8217;ll learn to
conjure and raise devils, but I&#8217;ll see some issue of
my spiteful execrations. Then there&#8217;s Achilles, a
rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
than little wit from them that they have! which
short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!</p>

<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit,
thou
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
out says thou art a fair corse, I&#8217;ll be sworn and
sworn upon&#8217;t she never shrouded any but lazars.
Amen. Where&#8217;s Achilles?</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>

<p class="speech">O, tell, tell.</p>

We are too well acquainted with these answers:<br>
But his evasion, wing&#8217;d thus swift with scorn,<br>

Much attribute he hath, and much the reason<br>
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,<br>
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,<br>
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,<br>
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,<br>
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,<br>
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,<br>
If you do say we think him over-proud<br>
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater<br>
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
than himself<br>
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,<br>
Disguise the holy strength of their command,<br>
And underwrite in an observing kind<br>
His humorous predominance; yea, watch<br>
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if<br>
The passage and whole carriage of this action<br>
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,<br>
That if he overhold his price so much,<br>
We&#8217;ll none of him; but let him, like an engine<br>
Not portable, lie under this report:<br>
&#8216;Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:<br>
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give<br>

<p class="speech">Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself
a
better man than I am?</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">No question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">Will you subscribe his thought, and say he
is?</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant,
as
wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
more tractable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow?
I
know not what pride is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues
the
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
the deed in the praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering
of toads.</p>

But carries on the stream of his dispose<br>
Without observance or respect of any,<br>
In will peculiar and in self-admission.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Why will he not upon our fair request<br>
Untent his person and share the air with us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Things small as nothing, for request&#8217;s sake
only,<br>
He makes important: possess&#8217;d he is with greatness,<br>
And speaks not to himself but with a pride<br>
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth<br>
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse<br>
That &#8217;twixt his mental and his active parts<br>
Kingdom&#8217;d Achilles in commotion rages<br>
And batters down himself: what should I say?<br>
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it<br>
Cry &#8216;No recovery.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Let Ajax go to him.<br>
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:<br>
&#8217;Tis said he holds you well, and will be led<br>
At your request a little from himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">O Agamemnon, let it not be so!<br>
We&#8217;ll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes<br>
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord<br>
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam<br>
And never suffers matter of the world<br>
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve<br>

Of that we hold an idol more than he?<br>
No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord<br>
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;<br>
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,<br>
As amply titled as Achilles is,<br>
By going to Achilles:<br>
That were to enlard his fat already pride<br>
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns<br>

Let Mars divide eternity in twain,<br>

<p class="speech">Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida?
no,

<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.</p>

For, O, love&#8217;s bow<br>
Shoots buck and doe:<br>
The shaft confounds,<br>
Not that it wounds,<br>
But tickles still the sore.<br>
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!<br>
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,<br>
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!<br>
So dying love lives still:<br>
Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!<br>
Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!<br>
Heigh-ho!</p>

<p class="speaker">Paris</p>

hot
blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>

<p class="speaker">Helen</p>
<p class="speech">He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord
Pandarus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>

weep
seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
is infinite and the execution confined, that the
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">They say all lovers swear more performance than
they
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
are they not monsters?</p>

bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
shall have a praise in present: we will not name
desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
speak truest not truer than Troilus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Will you walk in, my lord?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Pandarus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">What, blushing still? have you not done talking
yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of
you,
you&#8217;ll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
flinch, chide me for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">You know now your hostages; your uncle&#8217;s
word and my
firm faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll give my word for her too: our
kindred,
though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
they&#8217;ll stick where they are thrown.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Boldness comes to me now, and brings me
heart.<br>
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day<br>
For many weary months.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,<br>
With the first glance that ever&#8212;pardon me&#8212;<br>
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.<br>
I love you now; but not, till now, so much<br>
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;<br>
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown<br>
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!<br>
Why have I blabb&#8217;d? who shall be true to us,<br>
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?<br>
But, though I loved you well, I woo&#8217;d you not;<br>
And yet, good faith, I wish&#8217;d myself a man,<br>
Or that we women had men&#8217;s privilege<br>
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,<br>
For in this rapture I shall surely speak<br>
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,<br>
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws<br>
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Pretty, i&#8217; faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;<br>
&#8217;Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:<br>
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?<br>
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Your leave, sweet Cressid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow
morning,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, content you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">What offends you, lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, mine own company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">You cannot shun Yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Let me go and try:<br>
I have a kind of self resides with you;<br>
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,<br>
To be another&#8217;s fool. I would be gone:<br>
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Well know they what they speak that speak so
wisely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than
love;<br>
And fell so roundly to a large confession,<br>
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,<br>
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love<br>
Exceeds man&#8217;s might; that dwells with gods above.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O that I thought it could be in a
woman&#8212;<br>
As, if it can, I will presume in you&#8212;<br>
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;<br>
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,<br>
Outliving beauty&#8217;s outward, with a mind<br>
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!<br>
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,<br>
That my integrity and truth to you<br>
Might be affronted with the match and weight<br>
Of such a winnow&#8217;d purity in love;<br>
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!<br>
I am as true as truth&#8217;s simplicity<br>
And simpler than the infancy of truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">In that I&#8217;ll war with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O virtuous fight,<br>
When right with right wars who shall be most right!<br>
True swains in love shall in the world to come<br>
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,<br>
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,<br>
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,<br>
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,<br>
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,<br>
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,<br>
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,<br>
As truth&#8217;s authentic author to be cited,<br>
&#8216;As true as Troilus&#8217; shall crown up the verse,<br>
And sanctify the numbers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Prophet may you be!<br>
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,<br>
When time is old and hath forgot itself,<br>
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,<br>
And blind oblivion swallow&#8217;d cities up,<br>
And mighty states characterless are grated<br>
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,<br>
From false to false, among false maids in love,<br>
Upbraid my falsehood! when they&#8217;ve said &#8216;as false<br>
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,<br>
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer&#8217;s calf,<br>
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,&#8217;<br>
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; let them say, to stick the heart of
falsehood,<br>
&#8216;As false as Cressid.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it;
I&#8217;ll be the
witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin&#8217;s.
If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
taken such pains to bring you together, let all
pitiful goers-between be called to the world&#8217;s end
after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with
a
bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
pretty encounters, press it to death: away!<br>
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here<br>
Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!</p>

Diomedes, Nestor, Ajax, Menelaus, and Calchas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Calchas</p>
<p class="speech">Now, princes, for the service I have done
you,<br>
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud<br>
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind<br>
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,<br>
I have abandon&#8217;d Troy, left my possession,<br>
Incurr&#8217;d a traitor&#8217;s name; exposed myself,<br>
From certain and possess&#8217;d conveniences,<br>
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all<br>
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition<br>
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,<br>
And here, to do you service, am become<br>
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:<br>
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,<br>
To give me now a little benefit,<br>
Out of those many register&#8217;d in promise,<br>
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Calchas</p>
<p class="speech">You have a Trojan prisoner, call&#8217;d
Antenor,<br>
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.<br>
Oft have you&#8212;often have you thanks therefore&#8212;<br>
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,<br>
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,<br>
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs<br>
That their negotiations all must slack,<br>
Wanting his manage; and they will almost<br>
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,<br>
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,<br>
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence<br>
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,<br>
In most accepted pain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Let Diomedes bear him,<br>
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have<br>
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,<br>
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:<br>
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow<br>
Be answer&#8217;d in his challenge: Ajax is ready.</p>

<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Achilles stands i&#8217; the entrance of his
tent:<br>
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,<br>
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,<br>
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:<br>
I will come last. &#8217;Tis like he&#8217;ll question me<br>
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:<br>
If so, I have derision medicinable,<br>
To use between your strangeness and his pride,<br>
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:<br>
It may be good: pride hath no other glass<br>
To show itself but pride, for supple knees<br>
Feed arrogance and are the proud man&#8217;s fees.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll execute your purpose, and put on<br>
A form of strangeness as we pass along:<br>
So do each lord, and either greet him not,<br>
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more<br>
Than if not look&#8217;d on. I will lead the way.</p>

Achilles?</p>

bend<br>
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;<br>
To come as humbly as they used to creep<br>
To holy altars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What, am I poor of late?<br>
&#8217;Tis certain, greatness, once fall&#8217;n out with
fortune,<br>
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is<br>
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others<br>
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,<br>
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,<br>
And not a man, for being simply man,<br>
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours<br>
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,<br>
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:<br>
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,<br>
The love that lean&#8217;d on them as slippery too,<br>
Do one pluck down another and together<br>
Die in the fall. But &#8217;tis not so with me:<br>
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy<br>
At ample point all that I did possess,<br>
Save these men&#8217;s looks; who do, methinks, find out<br>
Something not worth in me such rich beholding<br>
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;<br>
I&#8217;ll interrupt his reading.<br>
How now Ulysses!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now, great Thetis&#8217; son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">What are you reading?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">A strange fellow here<br>
Writes me: &#8216;That man, how dearly ever parted,<br>
How much in having, or without or in,<br>
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,<br>
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;<br>
As when his virtues shining upon others<br>
Heat them and they retort that heat again<br>
To the first giver.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">This is not strange, Ulysses.<br>
The beauty that is borne here in the face<br>
The bearer knows not, but commends itself<br>
To others&#8217; eyes; nor doth the eye itself,<br>
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,<br>
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed<br>
Salutes each other with each other&#8217;s form;<br>
For speculation turns not to itself,<br>
Till it hath travell&#8217;d and is mirror&#8217;d there<br>
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">I do not strain at the position,&#8212;<br>
It is familiar,&#8212;but at the author&#8217;s drift;<br>
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves<br>
That no man is the lord of any thing,<br>
Though in and of him there be much consisting,<br>
Till he communicate his parts to others:<br>
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught<br>
Till he behold them form&#8217;d in the applause<br>
Where they&#8217;re extended; who, like an arch,
reverberates<br>
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel<br>
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back<br>
His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;<br>
And apprehended here immediately<br>
The unknown Ajax.<br>
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,<br>
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are<br>
Most abject in regard and dear in use!<br>
What things again most dear in the esteem<br>
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow&#8212;<br>
An act that very chance doth throw upon him&#8212;<br>
Ajax renown&#8217;d. O heavens, what some men do,<br>
While some men leave to do!<br>
How some men creep in skittish fortune&#8217;s hall,<br>
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!<br>
How one man eats into another&#8217;s pride,<br>
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!<br>
To see these Grecian lords!&#8212;why, even already<br>
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,<br>
As if his foot were on brave Hector&#8217;s breast<br>
And great Troy shrieking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">I do believe it; for they pass&#8217;d by me<br>
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me<br>
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,<br>
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,<br>
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:<br>
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour&#8217;d<br>
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon<br>
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,<br>
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang<br>
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail<br>
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;<br>
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,<br>
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;<br>
For emulation hath a thousand sons<br>
That one by one pursue: if you give way,<br>
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,<br>
Like to an enter&#8217;d tide, they all rush by<br>
And leave you hindmost;<br>
Or like a gallant horse fall&#8217;n in first rank,<br>
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<br>
O&#8217;er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,<br>
Though less than yours in past, must o&#8217;ertop yours;<br>
For time is like a fashionable host<br>
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,<br>
And with his arms outstretch&#8217;d, as he would fly,<br>
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,<br>
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
virtue seek<br>
Remuneration for the thing it was;<br>
For beauty, wit,<br>
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,<br>
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all<br>
To envious and calumniating time.<br>
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,<br>
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,<br>
Though they are made and moulded of things past,<br>
And give to dust that is a little gilt<br>
More laud than gilt o&#8217;er-dusted.<br>
The present eye praises the present object.<br>
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,<br>
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;<br>
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye<br>
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,<br>
And still it might, and yet it may again,<br>
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive<br>
And case thy reputation in thy tent;<br>
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,<br>
Made emulous missions &#8217;mongst the gods themselves<br>
And drave great Mars to faction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Of this my privacy<br>
I have strong reasons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">But &#8217;gainst your privacy<br>
The reasons are more potent and heroical:<br>
&#8217;Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love<br>
With one of Priam&#8217;s daughters.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! known!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Is that a wonder?<br>
The providence that&#8217;s in a watchful state<br>
Knows almost every grain of Plutus&#8217; gold,<br>
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,<br>
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,<br>
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.<br>
There is a mystery&#8212;with whom relation<br>
Durst never meddle&#8212;in the soul of state;<br>
Which hath an operation more divine<br>
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:<br>
All the commerce that you have had with Troy<br>
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;<br>
And better would it fit Achilles much<br>
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:<br>
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,<br>
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,<br>
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,<br>
&#8216;Great Hector&#8217;s sister did Achilles win,<br>
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.&#8217;<br>
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;<br>
The fool slides o&#8217;er the ice that you should break.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:<br>
A woman impudent and mannish grown<br>
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man<br>
In time of action. I stand condemn&#8217;d for this;<br>
They think my little stomach to the war<br>
And your great love to me restrains you thus:<br>
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid<br>
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,<br>
And, like a dew-drop from the lion&#8217;s mane,<br>
Be shook to air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Shall Ajax fight with Hector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">I see my reputation is at stake<br>
My fame is shrewdly gored.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">O, then, beware;<br>
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:<br>
Omission to do what is necessary<br>
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;<br>
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints<br>
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:<br>
I&#8217;ll send the fool to Ajax and desire him<br>
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat<br>
To see us here unarm&#8217;d: I have a woman&#8217;s longing,<br>
An appetite that I am sick withal,<br>
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,<br>
To talk with him and to behold his visage,<br>
Even to my full of view.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thersites</span></p>
<p class="speech">A labour saved!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">A wonder!</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for
himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">How so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and
is so
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
raves in saying nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">How can that be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he stalks up and down like a
peacock,&#8212;a stride
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
say &#8216;There were wit in this head, an &#8217;twould
out;&#8217;
and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
The man&#8217;s undone forever; for if Hector break not his
neck i&#8217; the combat, he&#8217;ll break &#8217;t himself in
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said &#8216;Good morrow,
Ajax;&#8217; and he replies &#8216;Thanks, Agamemnon.&#8217; What
think
you of this man that takes me for the general? He&#8217;s
grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
sides, like a leather jerkin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Who, I? why, he&#8217;ll answer nobody; he
professes not
answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
tongue in&#8217;s arms. I will put on his presence: let
Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
pageant of Ajax.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire
the
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure

You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,<br>
Did haunt you in the field.</p>

Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!<br>

With all my force, pursuit and policy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly<br>
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,<br>
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises&#8217; life,<br>

No man alive can love in such a sort<br>
The thing he means to kill more excellently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">We sympathize: Jove, let Aeneas live,<br>
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,<br>
A thousand complete courses of the sun!<br>
But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,<br>
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!</p>

Let&#8217;s have your company, or, if you please,<br>
Haste there before us: I constantly do think&#8212;<br>
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge&#8212;<br>
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:<br>
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.<br>
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear<br>
We shall be much unwelcome.</p>

Myself or Menelaus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Both alike:<br>
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,<br>
Not making any scruple of her soilure,<br>
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,<br>
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,<br>
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,<br>
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:<br>
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up<br>
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;<br>
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins<br>
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:<br>
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;<br>
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">You are too bitter to your countrywoman.</p>

<p class="speech">She&#8217;s bitter to her country: hear me,
Paris:<br>
For every false drop in her bawdy veins<br>
A Grecian&#8217;s life hath sunk; for every scruple<br>
Of her contaminated carrion weight,<br>
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,<br>
She hath not given so many good words breath<br>
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer&#8217;d death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,<br>

<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll grow friend with danger. Wear this
sleeve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">And you this glove. When shall I see you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,<br>
To give thee nightly visitation.<br>
But yet be true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O heavens! &#8216;be true&#8217;
again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Hear while I speak it, love:<br>
The Grecian youths are full of quality;<br>
They&#8217;re loving, well composed with gifts of nature,<br>
Flowing and swelling o&#8217;er with arts and exercise:<br>
How novelty may move, and parts with person,<br>
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy&#8212;<br>
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin&#8212;<br>
Makes me afeard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O heavens! you love me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Die I a villain, then!<br>
In this I do not call your faith in question<br>
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,<br>
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,<br>
Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,<br>
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:<br>
But I can tell that in each grace of these<br>
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil<br>
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Do you think I will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">No.<br>
But something may be done that we will not:<br>
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,<br>
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,<br>
Presuming on their changeful potency.</p>

Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,<br>
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;<br>
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,<br>
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.<br>
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit<br>

So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:<br>
The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,<br>
Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed<br>
You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,<br>
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee<br>
In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,<br>
She is as far high-soaring o&#8217;er thy praises<br>
As thou unworthy to be call&#8217;d her servant.<br>
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;<br>
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,<br>
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,<br>

<p class="speech">O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:<br>
Let me be privileged by my place and message,<br>
To be a speaker free; when I am hence<br>
I&#8217;ll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,<br>
I&#8217;ll nothing do on charge: to her own worth<br>
She shall be prized; but that you say &#8216;be&#8217;t
so,&#8217;<br>

Troilus, and other Trojans, with Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be
done<br>
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose<br>
A victor shall be known? will you the knights<br>
Shall to the edge of all extremity<br>
Pursue each other, or shall be divided<br>
By any voice or order of the field?<br>
Hector bade ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Which way would Hector have it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">He cares not; he&#8217;ll obey conditions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis done like Hector; but securely
done,<br>
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing<br>
The knight opposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">If not Achilles, sir,<br>
What is your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;If not Achilles, nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore Achilles: but, whate&#8217;er, know
this:<br>
In the extremity of great and little,<br>
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;<br>
The one almost as infinite as all,<br>
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,<br>
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.<br>
This Ajax is half made of Hector&#8217;s blood:<br>
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;<br>
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek<br>
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>

<p class="speech">Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,<br>
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord Aeneas<br>
Consent upon the order of their fight,<br>
So be it; either to the uttermost,<br>
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin<br>
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.</p>

<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,<br>
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,<br>
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;<br>
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm&#8217;d:<br>
His heart and hand both open and both free;<br>
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;<br>
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,<br>
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;<br>
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;<br>
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes<br>
To tender objects, but he in heat of action<br>
Is more vindicative than jealous love:<br>
They call him Troilus, and on him erect<br>
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.<br>
Thus says Aeneas; one that knows the youth<br>
Even to his inches, and with private soul<br>
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.</p>

Thou art, great lord, my father&#8217;s sister&#8217;s son,<br>
A cousin-german to great Priam&#8217;s seed;<br>
The obligation of our blood forbids<br>
A gory emulation &#8217;twixt us twain:<br>
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so<br>
That thou couldst say &#8216;This hand is Grecian all,<br>
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg<br>
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother&#8217;s blood<br>
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister<br>
Bounds in my father&#8217;s;&#8217; by Jove multipotent,<br>
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member<br>
Wherein my sword had not impressure made<br>
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay<br>
That any drop thou borrow&#8217;dst from thy mother,<br>
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword<br>
Be drain&#8217;d! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:<br>
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;<br>
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:<br>
Cousin, all honour to thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, Hector<br>
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:<br>
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence<br>
A great addition earned in thy death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Not Neoptolemus so mirable,<br>
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud&#8217;st Oyes<br>
Cries &#8216;This is he,&#8217; could promise to himself<br>
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.</p>

What further you will do.</p>

When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i&#8217; the air,<br>
Not letting it decline on the declined,<br>
That I have said to some my standers by<br>
&#8216;Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!&#8217;<br>
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,<br>
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm&#8217;d thee in,<br>
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;<br>
But this thy countenance, still lock&#8217;d in steel,<br>
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,<br>
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;<br>
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,<br>
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;<br>
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.</p>

<p class="speech">Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:<br>
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;<br>
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,<br>

There they stand yet, and modestly I think,<br>

But there&#8217;s more in me than thou understand&#8217;st.<br>
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?</p>

body<br>
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?<br>
That I may give the local wound a name<br>
And make distinct the very breach whereout<br>
Hector&#8217;s great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,<br>
To answer such a question: stand again:<br>
Think&#8217;st thou to catch my life so pleasantly<br>
As to prenominate in nice conjecture<br>
Where thou wilt hit me dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, yea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,<br>
I&#8217;d not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;<br>
For I&#8217;ll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;<br>
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,<br>
I&#8217;ll kill thee every where, yea, o&#8217;er and
o&#8217;er.<br>
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;<br>

If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,<br>
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.</p>

The Grecians&#8217; cause.</p>

There in the full convive we: afterwards,<br>
As Hector&#8217;s leisure and your bounties shall<br>
Concur together, severally entreat him.<br>

As gentle tell me, of what honour was<br>
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there<br>
That wails her absence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars<br>

shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother&#8217;s
leg,&#8212;to what form but that he is, should wit larded
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I

<p class="speech">It is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Why stay we, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">To make a recordation to my soul<br>
Of every syllable that here was spoke.<br>
But if I tell how these two did co-act,<br>
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?<br>
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,<br>
An esperance so obstinately strong,<br>
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,<br>
As if those organs had deceptious functions,<br>
Created only to calumniate.<br>
Was Cressid here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot conjure, Trojan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">She was not, sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Most sure she was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Let it not be believed for womanhood!<br>
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage<br>
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,<br>
For depravation, to square the general sex<br>
By Cressid&#8217;s rule: rather think this not Cressid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">What hath she done, prince, that can soil our
mothers?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at all, unless that this were she.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Will he swagger himself out on&#8217;s own
eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">This she? no, this is Diomed&#8217;s
Cressida:<br>
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;<br>
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,<br>
If sanctimony be the gods&#8217; delight,<br>
If there be rule in unity itself,<br>
This is not she. O madness of discourse,<br>
That cause sets up with and against itself!<br>
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt<br>
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason<br>
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.<br>
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight<br>
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate<br>
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,<br>
And yet the spacious breadth of this division<br>
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle<br>
As Ariachne&#8217;s broken woof to enter.<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto&#8217;s gates;<br>
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:<br>
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;<br>
The bonds of heaven are slipp&#8217;d, dissolved, and loosed;<br>
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,<br>
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,<br>
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics<br>
Of her o&#8217;er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">May worthy Troilus be half attach&#8217;d<br>
With that which here his passion doth express?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well<br>
In characters as red as Mars his heart<br>
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy<br>
With so eternal and so fix&#8217;d a soul.<br>
Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,<br>
So much by weight hate I her Diomed:<br>
That sleeve is mine that he&#8217;ll bear on his helm;<br>
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan&#8217;s skill,<br>
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout<br>
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,<br>
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,<br>
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune&#8217;s ear<br>
In his descent than shall my prompted sword<br>
Falling on Diomed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll tickle it for his concupy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false,
false!<br>
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,<br>
And they&#8217;ll seem glorious.</p>

Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Have with you, prince. My courteous lord,
adieu.<br>
Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,<br>
Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll bring you to the gates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Accept distracted thanks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Troilus, Aeneas, and
Ulysses</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
Patroclus will give me any thing for the
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!</p>

Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:<br>
Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:<br>
And when I have the bloody Hector found,<br>
Empale him with your weapons round about;<br>
In fellest manner execute your aims.<br>
Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:<br>
It is decreed Hector the great must die.</p>

Now,

<p class="speech">I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a
bastard
begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
Take heed, the quarrel&#8217;s most ominous to us: if the

I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,<br>

Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?<br>
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call&#8217;d,<br>
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector&#8217;s dead:<br>
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;<br>
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,<br>
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,<br>
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:<br>
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.<br>
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,<br>
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,<br>
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,<br>
I&#8217;ll through and through you! and, thou great-sized
coward,<br>
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:<br>
I&#8217;ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,<br>
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy&#8217;s thoughts.<br>

Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</p>

O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set

endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:<br>
Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,<br>
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;<br>
And being once subdued in armed tail,<br>
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.<br>
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
painted cloths.<br>
As many as be here of pander&#8217;s hall,<br>
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar&#8217;s fall;<br>
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,<br>
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.<br>
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,<br>
Some two months hence my will shall here be made:<br>
It should be now, but that my fear is this,<br>
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:<br>
Till then I&#8217;ll sweat and seek about for eases,<br>
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.</p>
