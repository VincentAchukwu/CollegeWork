<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title="Scene I. Westminster Abbey.">
<h4>Scene I. Westminster Abbey.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dead March. Enter the Funeral
of King Henry the Fifth, attended on by Dukes of Bedford, Regent of
France; Gloucester, Protector; and Exeter, Earl of Warwick, the
Bishop Of Winchester, Heralds, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to
night!<br>
Comets, importing change of times and states,<br>
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,<br>
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars<br>
That have consented unto Henry&#8217;s death!<br>
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!<br>
England ne&#8217;er lost a king of so much worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">England ne&#8217;er had a king until his
time.<br>
Virtue he had, deserving to command:<br>
His brandish&#8217;d sword did blind men with his beams:<br>
His arms spread wider than a dragon&#8217;s wings;<br>
His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,<br>
More dazzled and drove back his enemies<br>
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.<br>
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:<br>
He ne&#8217;er lift up his hand but conquered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?<br>
Henry is dead and never shall revive:<br>
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,<br>
And death&#8217;s dishonourable victory<br>
We with our stately presence glorify,<br>
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.<br>
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap<br>
That plotted thus our glory&#8217;s overthrow?<br>
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French<br>
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him<br>
By magic verses have contrived his end?<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">He was a king bless&#8217;d of the King of
kings.<br>
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day<br>
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.<br>
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:<br>
The church&#8217;s prayers made him so prosperous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The church! where is it? Had not churchmen
pray&#8217;d,<br>
His thread of life had not so soon decay&#8217;d:<br>
None do you like but an effeminate prince,<br>
Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, whate&#8217;er we like, thou art
protector<br>
And lookest to command the prince and realm.<br>
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,<br>
More than God or religious churchmen may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,<br>
And ne&#8217;er throughout the year to church thou go&#8217;st<br>
Except it be to pray against thy foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in
peace:<br>
Let&#8217;s to the altar: heralds, wait on us:<br>
Instead of gold, we&#8217;ll offer up our arms:<br>
Since arms avail not now that Henry&#8217;s dead.<br>
Posterity, await for wretched years,<br>
When at their mothers&#8217; moist eyes babes shall suck,<br>
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,<br>
And none but women left to wail the dead.<br>
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:<br>
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,<br>
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!<br>
A far more glorious star thy soul will make<br>
Than Julius Caesar or bright&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My honourable lords, health to you all!<br>
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,<br>
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:<br>
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,<br>
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, man, before dead
Henry&#8217;s corse?<br>
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns<br>
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?<br>
If Henry were recall&#8217;d to life again,<br>
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">How were they lost? what treachery was used?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">No treachery; but want of men and money.<br>
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,<br>
That here you maintain several factions,<br>
And whilst a field should be dispatch&#8217;d and fought,<br>
You are disputing of your generals:<br>
One would have lingering wars with little cost;<br>
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;<br>
A third thinks, without expense at all,<br>
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain&#8217;d.<br>
Awake, awake, English nobility!<br>
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:<br>
Cropp&#8217;d are the flower-de-luces in your arms;<br>
Of England&#8217;s coat one half is cut away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Were our tears wanting to this funeral,<br>
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Me they concern; Regent I am of France.<br>
Give me my steeled coat. I&#8217;ll fight for France.<br>
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!<br>
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,<br>
To weep their intermissive miseries.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter to them another
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, view these letters full of bad
mischance.<br>
France is revolted from the English quite,<br>
Except some petty towns of no import:<br>
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;<br>
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join&#8217;d;<br>
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;<br>
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!<br>
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">We will not fly, but to our enemies&#8217;
throats.<br>
Bedford, if thou be slack, I&#8217;ll fight it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, why doubt&#8217;st thou of my
forwardness?<br>
An army have I muster&#8217;d in my thoughts,<br>
Wherewith already France is overrun.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter another
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lords, to add to your laments,<br>
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry&#8217;s hearse,<br>
I must inform you of a dismal fight<br>
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">What! wherein Talbot overcame? is&#8217;t so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was
o&#8217;erthrown:<br>
The circumstance I&#8217;ll tell you more at large.<br>
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,<br>
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,<br>
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.<br>
By three and twenty thousand of the French<br>
Was round encompassed and set upon.<br>
No leisure had he to enrank his men;<br>
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;<br>
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck&#8217;d out of hedges<br>
They pitched in the ground confusedly,<br>
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.<br>
More than three hours the fight continued;<br>
Where valiant Talbot above human thought<br>
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:<br>
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;<br>
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:<br>
The French exclaim&#8217;d, the devil was in arms;<br>
All the whole army stood agazed on him:<br>
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit<br>
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain<br>
And rush&#8217;d into the bowels of the battle.<br>
Here had the conquest fully been seal&#8217;d up,<br>
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play&#8217;d the coward:<br>
He, being in the vaward, placed behind<br>
With purpose to relieve and follow them,<br>
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.<br>
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;<br>
Enclosed were they with their enemies:<br>
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin&#8217;s grace,<br>
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,<br>
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength<br>
Durst not presume to look once in the face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,<br>
For living idly here in pomp and ease,<br>
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,<br>
Unto his dastard foemen is betray&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,<br>
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:<br>
Most of the rest slaughter&#8217;d or took likewise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">His ransom there is none but I shall pay:<br>
I&#8217;ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:<br>
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;<br>
Four of their lords I&#8217;ll change for one of ours.<br>
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;<br>
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,<br>
To keep our great Saint George&#8217;s feast withal:<br>
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,<br>
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;<br>
The English army is grown weak and faint:<br>
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,<br>
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,<br>
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,<br>
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,<br>
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">I do remember it; and here take my leave,<br>
To go about my preparation.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll to the Tower with all the haste I
can,<br>
To view the artillery and munition;<br>
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">To Eltham will I, where the young king is,<br>
Being ordain&#8217;d his special governor,<br>
And for his safety there I&#8217;ll best devise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Each hath his place and function to attend:<br>
I am left out; for me nothing remains.<br>
But long I will not be Jack out of office:<br>
The king from Eltham I intend to steal<br>
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. France. Before Orleans.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sound a flourish. Enter
Charles, Alencon, and Reignier, marching with drum and
Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens<br>
So in the earth, to this day is not known:<br>
Late did he shine upon the English side;<br>
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.<br>
What towns of any moment but we have?<br>
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;<br>
Otherwhiles the famish&#8217;d English, like pale ghosts,<br>
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">They want their porridge and their fat
bull-beeves:<br>
Either they must be dieted like mules<br>
And have their provender tied to their mouths<br>
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s raise the siege: why live we idly
here?<br>
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:<br>
Remaineth none but mad-brain&#8217;d Salisbury;<br>
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,<br>
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.<br>
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!<br>
Him I forgive my death that killeth me<br>
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here alarum; they are beaten
back by the English with great loss. Re-enter Charles, Alencon, and
Reignier</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Who ever saw the like? what men have I!<br>
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne&#8217;er have fled,<br>
But that they left me &#8217;midst my enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Salisbury is a desperate homicide;<br>
He fighteth as one weary of his life.<br>
The other lords, like lions wanting food,<br>
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,<br>
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,<br>
During the time Edward the Third did reign.<br>
More truly now may this be verified;<br>
For none but Samsons and Goliases<br>
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!<br>
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e&#8217;er suppose<br>
They had such courage and audacity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s leave this town; for they are
hare-brain&#8217;d slaves,<br>
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:<br>
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth<br>
The walls they&#8217;ll tear down than forsake the siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">I think, by some odd gimmors or device<br>
Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;<br>
Else ne&#8217;er could they hold out so as they do.<br>
By my consent, we&#8217;ll even let them alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Be it so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Bastard Of
Orleans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s the Prince Dauphin? I have news for
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer
appall&#8217;d:<br>
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?<br>
Be not dismay&#8217;d, for succor is at hand:<br>
A holy maid hither with me I bring,<br>
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven<br>
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege<br>
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.<br>
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,<br>
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:<br>
What&#8217;s past and what&#8217;s to come she can descry.<br>
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,<br>
For they are certain and unfallible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Go, call her in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bastard Of
Orleans</span></p>
<p class="speech">But first, to try her skill,<br>
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:<br>
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:<br>
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter the Bastard Of
Orleans, with Joan La Pucelle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Fair maid, is&#8217;t thou wilt do these wondrous
feats?</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Reignier, is&#8217;t thou that thinkest to
beguile me?<br>
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;<br>
I know thee well, though never seen before.<br>
Be not amazed, there&#8217;s nothing hid from me:<br>
In private will I talk with thee apart.<br>
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">She takes upon her bravely at first dash.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd&#8217;s

Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,<br>
And to sun&#8217;s parching heat display&#8217;d my cheeks,<br>
God&#8217;s mother deigned to appear to me<br>
And in a vision full of majesty<br>
Will&#8217;d me to leave my base vocation<br>
And free my country from calamity:<br>
Her aid she promised and assured success:<br>
In complete glory she reveal&#8217;d herself;<br>
And, whereas I was black and swart before,<br>
With those clear rays which she infused on me<br>
That beauty am I bless&#8217;d with which you see.<br>
Ask me what question thou canst possible,<br>
And I will answer unpremeditated:<br>
My courage try by combat, if thou darest,<br>
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.<br>
Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,<br>
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</p>

In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,<br>
And thence discover how with most advantage<br>
They may vex us with shot, or with assault.<br>

Then broke I from the officers that led me,<br>
And with my nails digg&#8217;d stones out of the ground,<br>
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:<br>
My grisly countenance made others fly;<br>
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.<br>
In iron walls they deem&#8217;d me not secure;<br>
So great fear of my name &#8217;mongst them was spread,<br>
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,<br>
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:<br>

And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,<br>
Nestor-like aged in an age of care,<br>
Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.<br>
These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,<br>
Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;<br>
Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,<br>
And pithless arms, like to a wither&#8217;d vine<br>
That droops his sapless branches to the ground;<br>
Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,<br>
Unable to support this lump of clay,<br>
Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,<br>

<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>

And answer was return&#8217;d that he will come.</p>

Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.<br>
Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,<br>
Before whose glory I was great in arms,<br>

And even since then hath Richard been obscured,<br>
Deprived of honour and inheritance.<br>
But now the arbitrator of despairs,<br>
Just death, kind umpire of men&#8217;s miseries,<br>
With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:<br>
I would his troubles likewise were expired,<br>

<p class="speech">Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,<br>
And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:<br>
O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,<br>

And now declare, sweet stem from York&#8217;s great stock,<br>
Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;<br>
And, in that ease, I&#8217;ll tell thee my disease.<br>
This day, in argument upon a case,<br>
Some words there grew &#8217;twixt Somerset and me;<br>
Among which terms he used his lavish tongue<br>
And did upbraid me with my father&#8217;s death:<br>
Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,<br>
Else with the like I had requited him.<br>
Therefore, good uncle, for my father&#8217;s sake,<br>
In honour of a true Plantagenet<br>
And for alliance sake, declare the cause<br>
My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">That cause, fair nephew, that imprison&#8217;d
me<br>
And hath detain&#8217;d me all my flowering youth<br>
Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,<br>
Was cursed instrument of his decease.<br>
Richard</p>

For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">I will, if that my fading breath permit<br>
And death approach not ere my tale be done.<br>
Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,<br>
Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward&#8217;s son,<br>
The first-begotten and the lawful heir,<br>
Of Edward king, the third of that descent:<br>
During whose reign the Percies of the north,<br>
Finding his usurpation most unjust,<br>
Endeavor&#8217;d my advancement to the throne:<br>
The reason moved these warlike lords to this<br>
Was, for that&#8212;young King Richard thus removed,<br>
Leaving no heir begotten of his body&#8212;<br>
I was the next by birth and parentage;<br>
For by my mother I derived am<br>
From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son<br>
To King Edward the Third; whereas he<br>
From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,<br>
Being but fourth of that heroic line.<br>
But mark: as in this haughty attempt<br>
They laboured to plant the rightful heir,<br>
I lost my liberty and they their lives.<br>
Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,<br>
Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,<br>
Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived<br>
From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,<br>
Marrying my sister that thy mother was,<br>
Again in pity of my hard distress<br>
Levied an army, weening to redeem<br>
And have install&#8217;d me in the diadem:<br>
But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl<br>
And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,<br>
In whom the tide rested, were suppress&#8217;d.<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">True; and thou seest that I no issue have<br>
And that my fainting words do warrant death;<br>
Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:<br>
But yet be wary in thy studious care.<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:<br>
But yet, methinks, my father&#8217;s execution<br>
Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">With silence, nephew, be thou politic:<br>
Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,<br>
And like a mountain, not to be removed.<br>
But now thy uncle is removing hence:<br>
As princes do their courts, when they are cloy&#8217;d<br>
With long continuance in a settled place.<br>
Richard</p>
<p class="speaker">Plantagenet</p>
<p class="speech">O, uncle, would some part of my young years<br>
Might but redeem the passage of your age!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mortimer</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer
doth<br>
Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.<br>
Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;<br>
Only give order for my funeral:<br>
And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes<br>
And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!</p>

And like a hermit overpass&#8217;d thy days.<br>
Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;<br>
And what I do imagine let that rest.<br>
Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself<br>
Will see his burial better than his life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out

Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:<br>

Which Somerset hath offer&#8217;d to my house:<br>

Through which our policy must make a breach:<br>
Take heed, be wary how you place your words;<br>
Talk like the vulgar sort of market men<br>
That come to gather money for their corn.<br>
If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,<br>
And that we find the slothful watch but weak,<br>
I&#8217;ll by a sign give notice to our friends,<br>
That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.</p>

<p class="speech">Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for
bread?<br>
I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast<br>
Before he&#8217;ll buy again at such a rate:<br>
&#8217;Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>

I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own<br>

<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,<br>
Encompass&#8217;d with thy lustful paramours!<br>
Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age<br>
And twit with cowardice a man half dead?<br>
Damsel, I&#8217;ll have a bout with you again,<br>
Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>

<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Signior, hang! base muleters of France!<br>
Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls<br>
And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Away, captains! let&#8217;s get us from the

Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,<br>
Prick&#8217;d on by public wrongs sustain&#8217;d in France,<br>
Either to get the town again or die:<br>
And I, as sure as English Henry lives<br>

We will bestow you in some better place,<br>

<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:<br>
Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen<br>

<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Not to be gone from hence; for once I read<br>
That stout Pendragon in his litter sick<br>
Came to the field and vanquished his foes:<br>
Methinks I should revive the soldiers&#8217; hearts,<br>
Because I ever found them as myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>

Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects<br>
Thy noble deeds as valour&#8217;s monuments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle
now?<br>
I think her old familiar is asleep:<br>
Now where&#8217;s the Bastard&#8217;s braves, and Charles his
gleeks?<br>
What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief<br>
That such a valiant company are fled.<br>
Now will we take some order in the town,<br>
Placing therein some expert officers,<br>
And then depart to Paris to the king,<br>
For there young Henry with his nobles lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">But yet, before we go, let&#8217;s not forget<br>
The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,<br>
But see his exequies fulfill&#8217;d in Rouen:<br>
A braver soldier never couched lance,<br>
A gentler heart did never sway in court;<br>
But kings and mightiest potentates must die,<br>
For that&#8217;s the end of human misery.</p>

Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,<br>

See, see the pining malady of France;<br>
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,<br>
Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.<br>
O, turn thy edged sword another way;<br>
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.<br>
One drop of blood drawn from thy country&#8217;s bosom<br>
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:<br>
Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,<br>
And wash away thy country&#8217;s stained spots.</p>

Who joint&#8217;st thou with but with a lordly nation<br>

When Talbot hath set footing once in France<br>
And fashion&#8217;d thee that instrument of ill,<br>
Who then but English Henry will be lord<br>
And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?<br>
Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,<br>
Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?<br>
And was he not in England prisoner?<br>
But when they heard he was thine enemy,<br>
They set him free without his ransom paid,<br>
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.<br>
See, then, thou fight&#8217;st against thy countrymen<br>

Thou wast installed in that high degree.<br>
Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest<br>
This dastard, at the battle of Patay,<br>
When but in all I was six thousand strong<br>
And that the French were almost ten to one,<br>
Before we met or that a stroke was given,<br>
Like to a trusty squire did run away:<br>
In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;<br>
Myself and divers gentlemen beside<br>
Were there surprised and taken prisoners.<br>

Knights of the garter were of noble birth,<br>

Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;<br>

Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.</p>

Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,<br>
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.<br>
And you, my lords, remember where we are,<br>
In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:<br>
If they perceive dissension in our looks<br>
And that within ourselves we disagree,<br>
How will their grudging stomachs be provoked<br>
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!<br>
Beside, what infamy will there arise,<br>
When foreign princes shall be certified<br>
That for a toy, a thing of no regard,<br>
King Henry&#8217;s peers and chief nobility<br>
Destroy&#8217;d themselves, and lost the realm of France!<br>
O, think upon the conquest of my father,<br>
My tender years, and let us not forego<br>
That for a trifle that was bought with blood<br>
Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.<br>
I see no reason, if I wear this rose,</p>

<p class="speech">That any one should therefore be suspicious<br>
I more incline to Somerset than York:<br>
Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:<br>
As well they may upbraid me with my crown,<br>
Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown&#8217;d.<br>
But your discretions better can persuade<br>
Than I am able to instruct or teach:<br>
And therefore, as we hither came in peace,<br>
So let us still continue peace and love.<br>
Cousin of York, we institute your grace<br>
To be our regent in these parts of France:<br>
And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite<br>
Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;<br>
And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,<br>
Go cheerfully together and digest.<br>
Your angry choler on your enemies.<br>
Ourself, my lord protector and the rest<br>

But howsoe&#8217;er, no simple man that sees<br>

The coward horse that bears me fail and die!<br>

Or to exclaim on fortune&#8217;s fickleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:<br>
Consent, and for thy honour give consent,<br>
Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;<br>
Whom I with pain have woo&#8217;d and won thereto;<br>
And this her easy-held imprisonment<br>
Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Fair Margaret knows<br>
That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Upon thy princely warrant, I descend<br>
To give thee answer of thy just demand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit from the
walls</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">And here I will expect thy coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sound. Enter
Reignier, below</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:<br>
Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,<br>
Fit to be made companion with a king:<br>
What answer makes your grace unto my suit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth<br>
To be the princely bride of such a lord;<br>
Upon condition I may quietly<br>
Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,<br>
Free from oppression or the stroke of war,<br>
My daughter shall be Henry&#8217;s, if he please.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">That is her ransom; I deliver her;<br>
And those two counties I will undertake<br>
Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">And I again, in Henry&#8217;s royal name,<br>
As deputy unto that gracious king,<br>
Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Reignier of France, I give thee kingly
thanks,<br>
Because this is in traffic of a king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">And yet, methinks, I could be well content<br>
To be mine own attorney in this case.<br>
I&#8217;ll over then to England with this news,<br>
And make this marriage to be solemnized.<br>
So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe<br>
In golden palaces, as it becomes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">I do embrace thee, as I would embrace<br>
The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and
prayers<br>
Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Going</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you,
Margaret;<br>
No princely commendations to my king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Such commendations as becomes a maid,<br>
A virgin and his servant, say to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.<br>
But madam, I must trouble you again;<br>
No loving token to his majesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,<br>
Never yet taint with love, I send the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">And this withal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kisses her</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">That for thyself: I will not so presume<br>
To send such peevish tokens to a king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Reignier and
Margaret</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;<br>
Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;<br>
There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.<br>
Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:<br>
Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,<br>
And natural graces that extinguish art;<br>
Repeat their semblance often on the seas,<br>
That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry&#8217;s feet,<br>
Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.</p>

<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Bring forth that sorceress condemn&#8217;d to
burn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Joan La Pucelle,
guarded, and a Shepherd</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Shepherd</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Joan, this kills thy father&#8217;s heart
outright!<br>
Have I sought every country far and near,<br>
And, now it is my chance to find thee out,<br>
Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?<br>
Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I&#8217;ll die with thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!<br>
I am descended of a gentler blood:<br>
Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shepherd</p>
<p class="speech">Out, out! My lords, an please you, &#8217;tis not
so;<br>
I did beget her, all the parish knows:<br>
Her mother liveth yet, can testify<br>
She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">This argues what her kind of life hath been,<br>
Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shepherd</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!<br>
God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;<br>
And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:<br>
Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn&#8217;d this
man,<br>
Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shepherd</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest<br>
The morn that I was wedded to her mother.<br>
Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.<br>
Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time<br>
Of thy nativity! I would the milk<br>
Thy mother gave thee when thou suck&#8217;dst her breast,<br>
Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!<br>
Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,<br>
I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!<br>
Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?<br>
O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Take her away; for she hath lived too long,<br>
To fill the world with vicious qualities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">First, let me tell you whom you have
condemn&#8217;d:<br>
Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,<br>
But issued from the progeny of kings;<br>
Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,<br>
By inspiration of celestial grace,<br>
To work exceeding miracles on earth.<br>
I never had to do with wicked spirits:<br>
But you, that are polluted with your lusts,<br>
Stain&#8217;d with the guiltless blood of innocents,<br>
Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,<br>
Because you want the grace that others have,<br>
You judge it straight a thing impossible<br>
To compass wonders but by help of devils.<br>
No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been<br>
A virgin from her tender infancy,<br>
Chaste and immaculate in very thought;<br>
Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,<br>
Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay: away with her to execution!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,<br>
Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:<br>
Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,<br>
That so her torture may be shortened.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?<br>
Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,<br>
That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.<br>
I am with child, ye bloody homicides:<br>
Murder not then the fruit within my womb,<br>
Although ye hale me to a violent death.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">The greatest miracle that e&#8217;er ye
wrought:<br>
Is all your strict preciseness come to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">She and the Dauphin have been juggling:<br>
I did imagine what would be her refuge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Well, go to; we&#8217;ll have no bastards
live;<br>
Especially since Charles must father it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">You are deceived; my child is none of his:<br>
It was Alencon that enjoy&#8217;d my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!<br>
It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">O, give me leave, I have deluded you:<br>
&#8217;Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,<br>
But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">A married man! that&#8217;s most intolerable.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s a girl! I think she knows not
well,<br>
There were so many, whom she may accuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">It&#8217;s sign she hath been liberal and
free.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.<br>
Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:<br>
Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my
curse:<br>
May never glorious sun reflex his beams<br>
Upon the country where you make abode;<br>
But darkness and the gloomy shade of death<br>
Environ you, till mischief and despair<br>
Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, guarded</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,<br>
Thou foul accursed minister of hell!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cardinal Of Winchester,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Lord regent, I do greet your excellence<br>
With letters of commission from the king.<br>
For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,<br>
Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,<br>
Have earnestly implored a general peace<br>
Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;<br>
And here at hand the Dauphin and his train<br>
Approacheth, to confer about some matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Is all our travail turn&#8217;d to
this effect?<br>
After the slaughter of so many peers,<br>
So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,<br>
That in this quarrel have been overthrown<br>
And sold their bodies for their country&#8217;s benefit,<br>
Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?<br>
Have we not lost most part of all the towns,<br>
By treason, falsehood and by treachery,<br>
Our great progenitors had conquered?<br>
O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief<br>
The utter loss of all the realm of France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,<br>
It shall be with such strict and severe covenants<br>
As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Charles, Alencon,
Bastard Of Orleans, Reignier, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed<br>
That peaceful truce shall be proclaim&#8217;d in France,<br>
We come to be informed by yourselves<br>
What the conditions of that league must be.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes<br>
The hollow passage of my poison&#8217;d voice,<br>
By sight of these our baleful enemies.<br>
Cardinal</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:<br>
That, in regard King Henry gives consent,<br>
Of mere compassion and of lenity,<br>
To ease your country of distressful war,<br>
And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,<br>
You shall become true liegemen to his crown:<br>
And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear<br>
To pay him tribute, submit thyself,<br>
Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,<br>
And still enjoy thy regal dignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Must he be then as shadow of himself?<br>
Adorn his temples with a coronet,<br>
And yet, in substance and authority,<br>
Retain but privilege of a private man?<br>
This proffer is absurd and reasonless.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis known already that I am
possess&#8217;d<br>
With more than half the Gallian territories,<br>
And therein reverenced for their lawful king:<br>
Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish&#8217;d,<br>
Detract so much from that prerogative,<br>
As to be call&#8217;d but viceroy of the whole?<br>
No, lord ambassador, I&#8217;ll rather keep<br>
That which I have than, coveting for more,<br>
Be cast from possibility of all.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means<br>
Used intercession to obtain a league,<br>
And, now the matter grows to compromise,<br>
Stand&#8217;st thou aloof upon comparison?<br>
Either accept the title thou usurp&#8217;st,<br>
Of benefit proceeding from our king<br>
And not of any challenge of desert,<br>
Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you do not well in obstinacy<br>
To cavil in the course of this contract:<br>
If once it be neglected, ten to one<br>
We shall not find like opportunity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">To say the truth, it is your policy<br>
To save your subjects from such massacre<br>
And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen<br>
By our proceeding in hostility;<br>
And therefore take this compact of a truce,<br>
Although you break it when your pleasure serves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">How say&#8217;st thou, Charles? shall our
condition stand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">It shall;<br>
Only reserved, you claim no interest<br>
In any of our towns of garrison.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then swear allegiance to his majesty,<br>
As thou art knight, never to disobey<br>
Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,<br>
Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.<br>
So, now dismiss your army when ye please:<br>
Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,<br>
For here we entertain a solemn peace.</p>

<h4>Scene V. London. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Suffolk in conference
with King Henry VI, Gloucester and Exeter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,<br>
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish&#8217;d me:<br>
Her virtues graced with external gifts<br>
Do breed love&#8217;s settled passions in my heart:<br>
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts<br>
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,<br>
So am I driven by breath of her renown<br>
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive<br>
Where I may have fruition of her love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale<br>
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;<br>
The chief perfections of that lovely dame<br>
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,<br>
Would make a volume of enticing lines,<br>
Able to ravish any dull conceit:<br>
And, which is more, she is not so divine,<br>
So full-replete with choice of all delights,<br>
But with as humble lowliness of mind<br>
She is content to be at your command;<br>
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,<br>
To love and honour Henry as her lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">And otherwise will Henry ne&#8217;er presume.<br>
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent<br>
That Margaret may be England&#8217;s royal queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">So should I give consent to flatter sin.<br>
You know, my lord, your highness is betroth&#8217;d<br>
Unto another lady of esteem:<br>
How shall we then dispense with that contract,<br>
And not deface your honour with reproach?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;<br>
Or one that, at a triumph having vow&#8217;d<br>
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists<br>
By reason of his adversary&#8217;s odds:<br>
A poor earl&#8217;s daughter is unequal odds,<br>
And therefore may be broke without offence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than
that?<br>
Her father is no better than an earl,<br>
Although in glorious titles he excel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, lord, her father is a king,<br>
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;<br>
And of such great authority in France<br>
As his alliance will confirm our peace<br>
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,<br>
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal
dower,<br>
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,<br>
That he should be so abject, base and poor,<br>
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.<br>
Henry is able to enrich his queen<br>
And not seek a queen to make him rich:<br>
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,<br>
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.<br>
Marriage is a matter of more worth<br>
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;<br>
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,<br>
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:<br>
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,<br>
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,<br>
In our opinions she should be preferr&#8217;d.<br>
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,<br>
An age of discord and continual strife?<br>
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,<br>
And is a pattern of celestial peace.<br>
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,<br>
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?<br>
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,<br>
Approves her fit for none but for a king:<br>
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,<br>
More than in women commonly is seen,<br>
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;<br>
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,<br>
Is likely to beget more conquerors,<br>
If with a lady of so high resolve<br>
As is fair Margaret he be link&#8217;d in love.<br>
Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me<br>
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Whether it be through force of your report,<br>
My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that<br>
My tender youth was never yet attaint<br>
With any passion of inflaming love,<br>
I cannot tell; but this I am assured,<br>
I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,<br>
Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,<br>
As I am sick with working of my thoughts.<br>
Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;<br>
Agree to any covenants, and procure<br>
That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come<br>
To cross the seas to England and be crown&#8217;d<br>
King Henry&#8217;s faithful and anointed queen:<br>
For your expenses and sufficient charge,<br>
Among the people gather up a tenth.<br>
Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,<br>
I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.<br>
And you, good uncle, banish all offence:<br>
If you do censure me by what you were,<br>
Not what you are, I know it will excuse<br>
This sudden execution of my will.<br>
And so, conduct me where, from company,<br>
I may revolve and ruminate my grief.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gloucester and
Exeter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Thus Suffolk hath prevail&#8217;d; and thus he
goes,<br>
As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,<br>
With hope to find the like event in love,<br>
But prosper better than the Trojan did.<br>
Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;<br>
But I will rule both her, the king and realm.</p>
