<h4>Scene I. Westminster Abbey.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dead March. Enter the Funeral
of King Henry the Fifth, attended on by Dukes of Bedford, Regent of
France; Gloucester, Protector; and Exeter, Earl of Warwick, the
Bishop Of Winchester, Heralds, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to
night!<br>
Comets, importing change of times and states,<br>
Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,<br>
And with them scourge the bad revolting stars<br>
That have consented unto Henry&#8217;s death!<br>
King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!<br>
England ne&#8217;er lost a king of so much worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">England ne&#8217;er had a king until his
time.<br>
Virtue he had, deserving to command:<br>
His brandish&#8217;d sword did blind men with his beams:<br>
His arms spread wider than a dragon&#8217;s wings;<br>
His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,<br>
More dazzled and drove back his enemies<br>
Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.<br>
What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:<br>
He ne&#8217;er lift up his hand but conquered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?<br>
Henry is dead and never shall revive:<br>
Upon a wooden coffin we attend,<br>
And death&#8217;s dishonourable victory<br>
We with our stately presence glorify,<br>
Like captives bound to a triumphant car.<br>
What! shall we curse the planets of mishap<br>
That plotted thus our glory&#8217;s overthrow?<br>
Or shall we think the subtle-witted French<br>
Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him<br>
By magic verses have contrived his end?<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">He was a king bless&#8217;d of the King of
kings.<br>
Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day<br>
So dreadful will not be as was his sight.<br>
The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:<br>
The church&#8217;s prayers made him so prosperous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The church! where is it? Had not churchmen
pray&#8217;d,<br>
His thread of life had not so soon decay&#8217;d:<br>
None do you like but an effeminate prince,<br>
Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, whate&#8217;er we like, thou art
protector<br>
And lookest to command the prince and realm.<br>
Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,<br>
More than God or religious churchmen may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,<br>
And ne&#8217;er throughout the year to church thou go&#8217;st<br>
Except it be to pray against thy foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in
peace:<br>
Let&#8217;s to the altar: heralds, wait on us:<br>
Instead of gold, we&#8217;ll offer up our arms:<br>
Since arms avail not now that Henry&#8217;s dead.<br>
Posterity, await for wretched years,<br>
When at their mothers&#8217; moist eyes babes shall suck,<br>
Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,<br>
And none but women left to wail the dead.<br>
Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:<br>
Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,<br>
Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!<br>
A far more glorious star thy soul will make<br>
Than Julius Caesar or bright&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My honourable lords, health to you all!<br>
Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,<br>
Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:<br>
Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,<br>
Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, man, before dead
Henry&#8217;s corse?<br>
Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns<br>
Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?<br>
If Henry were recall&#8217;d to life again,<br>
These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">How were they lost? what treachery was used?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">No treachery; but want of men and money.<br>
Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,<br>
That here you maintain several factions,<br>
And whilst a field should be dispatch&#8217;d and fought,<br>
You are disputing of your generals:<br>
One would have lingering wars with little cost;<br>
Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;<br>
A third thinks, without expense at all,<br>
By guileful fair words peace may be obtain&#8217;d.<br>
Awake, awake, English nobility!<br>
Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:<br>
Cropp&#8217;d are the flower-de-luces in your arms;<br>
Of England&#8217;s coat one half is cut away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Were our tears wanting to this funeral,<br>
These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Me they concern; Regent I am of France.<br>
Give me my steeled coat. I&#8217;ll fight for France.<br>
Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!<br>
Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,<br>
To weep their intermissive miseries.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter to them another
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, view these letters full of bad
mischance.<br>
France is revolted from the English quite,<br>
Except some petty towns of no import:<br>
The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;<br>
The Bastard of Orleans with him is join&#8217;d;<br>
Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;<br>
The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!<br>
O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">We will not fly, but to our enemies&#8217;
throats.<br>
Bedford, if thou be slack, I&#8217;ll fight it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, why doubt&#8217;st thou of my
forwardness?<br>
An army have I muster&#8217;d in my thoughts,<br>
Wherewith already France is overrun.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter another
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lords, to add to your laments,<br>
Wherewith you now bedew King Henry&#8217;s hearse,<br>
I must inform you of a dismal fight<br>
Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">What! wherein Talbot overcame? is&#8217;t so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was
o&#8217;erthrown:<br>
The circumstance I&#8217;ll tell you more at large.<br>
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,<br>
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,<br>
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.<br>
By three and twenty thousand of the French<br>
Was round encompassed and set upon.<br>
No leisure had he to enrank his men;<br>
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;<br>
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck&#8217;d out of hedges<br>
They pitched in the ground confusedly,<br>
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.<br>
More than three hours the fight continued;<br>
Where valiant Talbot above human thought<br>
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:<br>
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;<br>
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:<br>
The French exclaim&#8217;d, the devil was in arms;<br>
All the whole army stood agazed on him:<br>
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit<br>
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain<br>
And rush&#8217;d into the bowels of the battle.<br>
Here had the conquest fully been seal&#8217;d up,<br>
If Sir John Fastolfe had not play&#8217;d the coward:<br>
He, being in the vaward, placed behind<br>
With purpose to relieve and follow them,<br>
Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.<br>
Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;<br>
Enclosed were they with their enemies:<br>
A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin&#8217;s grace,<br>
Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,<br>
Whom all France with their chief assembled strength<br>
Durst not presume to look once in the face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,<br>
For living idly here in pomp and ease,<br>
Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,<br>
Unto his dastard foemen is betray&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,<br>
And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:<br>
Most of the rest slaughter&#8217;d or took likewise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">His ransom there is none but I shall pay:<br>
I&#8217;ll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:<br>
His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;<br>
Four of their lords I&#8217;ll change for one of ours.<br>
Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;<br>
Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,<br>
To keep our great Saint George&#8217;s feast withal:<br>
Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,<br>
Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;<br>
The English army is grown weak and faint:<br>
The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,<br>
And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,<br>
Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,<br>
Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,<br>
Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bedford</p>
<p class="speech">I do remember it; and here take my leave,<br>
To go about my preparation.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll to the Tower with all the haste I
can,<br>
To view the artillery and munition;<br>
And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">To Eltham will I, where the young king is,<br>
Being ordain&#8217;d his special governor,<br>
And for his safety there I&#8217;ll best devise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Each hath his place and function to attend:<br>
I am left out; for me nothing remains.<br>
But long I will not be Jack out of office:<br>
The king from Eltham I intend to steal<br>
And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</p>

<h4>Scene II. France. Before Orleans.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sound a flourish. Enter
Charles, Alencon, and Reignier, marching with drum and
Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens<br>
So in the earth, to this day is not known:<br>
Late did he shine upon the English side;<br>
Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.<br>
What towns of any moment but we have?<br>
At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;<br>
Otherwhiles the famish&#8217;d English, like pale ghosts,<br>
Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">They want their porridge and their fat
bull-beeves:<br>
Either they must be dieted like mules<br>
And have their provender tied to their mouths<br>
Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s raise the siege: why live we idly
here?<br>
Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:<br>
Remaineth none but mad-brain&#8217;d Salisbury;<br>
And he may well in fretting spend his gall,<br>
Nor men nor money hath he to make war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.<br>
Now for the honour of the forlorn French!<br>
Him I forgive my death that killeth me<br>
When he sees me go back one foot or fly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here alarum; they are beaten
back by the English with great loss. Re-enter Charles, Alencon, and
Reignier</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Who ever saw the like? what men have I!<br>
Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne&#8217;er have fled,<br>
But that they left me &#8217;midst my enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Salisbury is a desperate homicide;<br>
He fighteth as one weary of his life.<br>
The other lords, like lions wanting food,<br>
Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,<br>
England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,<br>
During the time Edward the Third did reign.<br>
More truly now may this be verified;<br>
For none but Samsons and Goliases<br>
It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!<br>
Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e&#8217;er suppose<br>
They had such courage and audacity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s leave this town; for they are
hare-brain&#8217;d slaves,<br>
And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:<br>
Of old I know them; rather with their teeth<br>
The walls they&#8217;ll tear down than forsake the siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">I think, by some odd gimmors or device<br>
Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;<br>
Else ne&#8217;er could they hold out so as they do.<br>
By my consent, we&#8217;ll even let them alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Be it so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Bastard Of
Orleans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s the Prince Dauphin? I have news for
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard Of Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer
appall&#8217;d:<br>
Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?<br>
Be not dismay&#8217;d, for succor is at hand:<br>
A holy maid hither with me I bring,<br>
Which by a vision sent to her from heaven<br>
Ordained is to raise this tedious siege<br>
And drive the English forth the bounds of France.<br>
The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,<br>
Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:<br>
What&#8217;s past and what&#8217;s to come she can descry.<br>
Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,<br>
For they are certain and unfallible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Go, call her in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bastard Of
Orleans</span></p>
<p class="speech">But first, to try her skill,<br>
Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:<br>
Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:<br>
By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter the Bastard Of
Orleans, with Joan La Pucelle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Fair maid, is&#8217;t thou wilt do these wondrous
feats?</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Reignier, is&#8217;t thou that thinkest to
beguile me?<br>
Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;<br>
I know thee well, though never seen before.<br>
Be not amazed, there&#8217;s nothing hid from me:<br>
In private will I talk with thee apart.<br>
Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">She takes upon her bravely at first dash.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd&#8217;s
daughter,<br>
My wit untrain&#8217;d in any kind of art.<br>
Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased<br>
To shine on my contemptible estate:<br>
Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,<br>
And to sun&#8217;s parching heat display&#8217;d my cheeks,<br>
God&#8217;s mother deigned to appear to me<br>
And in a vision full of majesty<br>
Will&#8217;d me to leave my base vocation<br>
And free my country from calamity:<br>
Her aid she promised and assured success:<br>
In complete glory she reveal&#8217;d herself;<br>
And, whereas I was black and swart before,<br>
With those clear rays which she infused on me<br>
That beauty am I bless&#8217;d with which you see.<br>
Ask me what question thou canst possible,<br>
And I will answer unpremeditated:<br>
My courage try by combat, if thou darest,<br>
And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.<br>
Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,<br>
If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast astonish&#8217;d me with thy high
terms:<br>
Only this proof I&#8217;ll of thy valour make,<br>
In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,<br>
And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;<br>
Otherwise I renounce all confidence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,<br>
Deck&#8217;d with five flower-de-luces on each side;<br>
The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine&#8217;s
churchyard,<br>
Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Then come, o&#8217; God&#8217;s name; I fear no
woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">And while I live, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er fly from
a man.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here they fight, and Joan La
Pucelle overcomes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon<br>
And fightest with the sword of Deborah.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Christ&#8217;s mother helps me, else I were too
weak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Whoe&#8217;er helps thee, &#8217;tis thou that
must help me:<br>
Impatiently I burn with thy desire;<br>
My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.<br>
Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,<br>
Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:<br>
&#8217;Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">I must not yield to any rites of love,<br>
For my profession&#8217;s sacred from above:<br>
When I have chased all thy foes from hence,<br>
Then will I think upon a recompense.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate
thrall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;<br>
Else ne&#8217;er could he so long protract his speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">He may mean more than we poor men do know:<br>
These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, where are you? what devise you on?<br>
Shall we give over Orleans, or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!<br>
Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">What she says I&#8217;ll confirm: we&#8217;ll
fight it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Assign&#8217;d am I to be the English
scourge.<br>
This night the siege assuredly I&#8217;ll raise:<br>
Expect Saint Martin&#8217;s summer, halcyon days,<br>
Since I have entered into these wars.<br>
Glory is like a circle in the water,<br>
Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself<br>
Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.<br>
With Henry&#8217;s death the English circle ends;<br>
Dispersed are the glories it included.<br>
Now am I like that proud insulting ship<br>
Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?<br>
Thou with an eagle art inspired then.<br>
Helen, the mother of great Constantine,<br>
Nor yet Saint Philip&#8217;s daughters, were like thee.<br>
Bright star of Venus, fall&#8217;n down on the earth,<br>
How may I reverently worship thee enough?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alencon</p>
<p class="speech">Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Reignier</p>
<p class="speech">Woman, do what thou canst to save our
honours;<br>
Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charles</p>
<p class="speech">Presently we&#8217;ll try: come, let&#8217;s away
about it:<br>
No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.</p>

here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?<br>
Open the gates; here&#8217;s Gloucester that would enter.</p>

The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:<br>
From him I have express commandment<br>
That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him &#8217;fore
me?<br>
Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,<br>
Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne&#8217;er could brook?<br>
Thou art no friend to God or to the king:<br>
Open the gates, or I&#8217;ll shut thee out shortly.<br>

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Peel&#8217;d priest, dost thou command me to be
shut out?<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">I do, thou most usurping proditor,<br>
And not protector, of the king or realm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,<br>
Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;<br>
Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:<br>
I&#8217;ll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal&#8217;s hat,<br>
If thou proceed in this thy insolence.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a
foot:<br>
This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,<br>
To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I will not slay thee, but I&#8217;ll drive thee
back:<br>
Thy scarlet robes as a child&#8217;s bearing-cloth<br>
I&#8217;ll use to carry thee out of this place.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What! am I dared and bearded to my face?<br>
Draw, men, for all this privileged place;<br>
Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,<br>
I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:<br>
Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal&#8217;s hat:<br>
In spite of pope or dignities of church,<br>
Here by the cheeks I&#8217;ll drag thee up and down.<br>

Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?<br>
Thee I&#8217;ll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep&#8217;s array.<br>
Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here Gloucester&#8217;s men

<p class="speaker">Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, lords! that you, being supreme
magistrates,<br>
Thus contumeliously should break the peace!</p>

<p class="speech">Peace, mayor! thou know&#8217;st little of my
wrongs:<br>
Here&#8217;s Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,<br>
Hath here distrain&#8217;d the Tower to his use.<br>
</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s Gloucester, a foe to citizens,<br>
One that still motions war and never peace,<br>
O&#8217;ercharging your free purses with large fines,<br>
That seeks to overthrow religion,<br>
Because he is protector of the realm,<br>
And would have armour here out of the Tower,<br>
To crown himself king and suppress the prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I will not answer thee with words, but blows.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here they skirmish
again</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife<br>
But to make open proclamation:<br>
Come, officer; as loud as e&#8217;er thou canst,<br>
Cry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">All manner of men assembled here in arms this
day
against God&#8217;s peace and the king&#8217;s, we charge and
command you, in his highness&#8217; name, to repair to
your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,

henceforward, upon pain of death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

Thy heart-blood I will have for this day&#8217;s work.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll call for clubs, if you will not
away.<br>
This cardinal&#8217;s more haughty than the devil.</p>

<p class="speech">Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou

<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Winchester</p>

<h4>Scene IV. Orleans.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, on the walls, a Master
Gunner and his Boy</span></p>
<p class="speech">Master-Gunner Sirrah, thou know&#8217;st how
Orleans is besieged,<br>
And how the English have the suburbs won.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boy</p>
<p class="speech">Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,<br>
Howe&#8217;er unfortunate I miss&#8217;d my aim.<br>
Master-Gunner But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:<br>
Chief master-gunner am I of this town;<br>
Something I must do to procure me grace.<br>
The prince&#8217;s espials have informed me<br>
How the English, in the suburbs close intrench&#8217;d,<br>
Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars<br>
In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,<br>
And thence discover how with most advantage<br>
They may vex us with shot, or with assault.<br>
To intercept this inconvenience,<br>
A piece of ordnance &#8217;gainst it I have placed;<br>
And even these three days have I watch&#8217;d,<br>
If I could see them.<br>
Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.<br>
If thou spy&#8217;st any, run and bring me word;<br>
And thou shalt find me at the governor&#8217;s.</p>

Salisbury and Talbot, Glansdale, Gargrave, and others</span></p>

return&#8217;d!<br>
How wert thou handled being prisoner?<br>
Or by what means got&#8217;st thou to be released?<br>
Discourse, I prithee, on this turret&#8217;s top.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner<br>
Call&#8217;d the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;<br>
For him was I exchanged and ransomed.<br>
But with a baser man of arms by far<br>
Once in contempt they would have barter&#8217;d me:<br>
Which I, disdaining, scorn&#8217;d; and craved death,<br>
Rather than I would be so vile esteem&#8217;d.<br>
In fine, redeem&#8217;d I was as I desired.<br>
But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,<br>
Whom with my bare fists I would execute,<br>
If I now had him brought into my power.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Yet tell&#8217;st thou not how thou wert
entertain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">With scoffs and scorns and contumelious
taunts.<br>
In open market-place produced they me,<br>
To be a public spectacle to all:<br>
Here, said they, is the terror of the French,<br>
The scarecrow that affrights our children so.<br>
Then broke I from the officers that led me,<br>
And with my nails digg&#8217;d stones out of the ground,<br>
To hurl at the beholders of my shame:<br>
My grisly countenance made others fly;<br>
None durst come near for fear of sudden death.<br>
In iron walls they deem&#8217;d me not secure;<br>
So great fear of my name &#8217;mongst them was spread,<br>
That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,<br>
And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:<br>
Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,<br>
That walked about me every minute-while;<br>
And if I did but stir out of my bed,<br>
Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Boy with a
linstock</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">I grieve to hear what torments you endured,<br>
But we will be revenged sufficiently<br>
Now it is supper-time in Orleans:<br>
Here, through this grate, I count each one<br>
And view the Frenchmen how they fortify:<br>
Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.<br>
Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,<br>
Let me have your express opinions<br>
Where is best place to make our battery next.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gargrave</p>
<p class="speech">I think, at the north gate; for there stand
lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Glansdale</p>
<p class="speech">And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">For aught I see, this city must be
famish&#8217;d,<br>
Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here they shoot. Salisbury
and Gargrave fall</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gargrave</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">What chance is this that suddenly hath
cross&#8217;d us?<br>
Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:<br>
How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?<br>
One of thy eyes and thy cheek&#8217;s side struck off!<br>
Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand<br>
That hath contrived this woful tragedy!<br>
In thirteen battles Salisbury o&#8217;ercame;<br>
Henry the Fifth he first train&#8217;d to the wars;<br>
Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,<br>
His sword did ne&#8217;er leave striking in the field.<br>
Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,<br>
One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:<br>
The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.<br>
Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,<br>
If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!<br>
Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.<br>
Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?<br>
Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.<br>
Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;<br>
Thou shalt not die whiles&#8212;<br>
He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.<br>
As who should say &#8216;When I am dead and gone,<br>
Remember to avenge me on the French.&#8217;<br>
Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,<br>
Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:<br>
Wretched shall France be only in my name.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here an alarum, and it
thunders and lightens</span></p>
<p class="speech">What stir is this? what tumult&#8217;s in the
heavens?<br>
Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, my lord, the French have gathered
head:<br>
The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join&#8217;d,<br>
A holy prophetess new risen up,<br>
Is come with a great power to raise the siege.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here Salisbury lifteth
himself up and groans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!<br>
It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.<br>
Frenchmen, I&#8217;ll be a Salisbury to you:<br>
Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,<br>
Your hearts I&#8217;ll stamp out with my horse&#8217;s heels,<br>
And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.<br>
Convey me Salisbury into his tent,<br>
And then we&#8217;ll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.</p>

Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:<br>
A woman clad in armour chaseth them.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Joan La
Pucelle</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here, here she comes. I&#8217;ll have a bout with
thee;<br>
Devil or devil&#8217;s dam, I&#8217;ll conjure thee:<br>
Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,<br>
And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Joan La Pucelle</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, &#8217;tis only I that must disgrace
thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here they fight</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?<br>
My breast I&#8217;ll burst with straining of my courage<br>
And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.<br>
But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.</p>

<p class="speech">Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:<br>
I must go victual Orleans forthwith.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A short alarum; then enter
the town with soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speech">O&#8217;ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy
strength.<br>
Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;<br>
Help Salisbury to make his testament:<br>
This day is ours, as many more shall be.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Talbot</p>
<p class="speech">My thoughts are whirled like a potter&#8217;s
wheel;<br>
I know not where I am, nor what I do;<br>
A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,<br>
Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:<br>
So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench<br>
Are from their hives and houses driven away.<br>
They call&#8217;d us for our fierceness English dogs;<br>
Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A short alarum</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,<br>
Or tear the lions out of England&#8217;s coat;<br>
Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions&#8217; stead:<br>
Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,<br>
Or horse or oxen from the leopard,<br>
As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. Here another
skirmish</span></p>
