<h4>Scene I. The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund&#8217;s.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sound a sennet. Enter King
Henry VI, Queen Margaret, Cardinal, Suffolk, York, Buckingham,
Salisbury and Warwick to the Parliament</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:<br>
&#8217;Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,<br>
Whate&#8217;er occasion keeps him from us now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Can you not see? or will ye not observe<br>
The strangeness of his alter&#8217;d countenance?<br>
With what a majesty he bears himself,<br>
How insolent of late he is become,<br>
How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?<br>
We know the time since he was mild and affable,<br>
And if we did but glance a far-off look,<br>
Immediately he was upon his knee,<br>
That all the court admired him for submission:<br>
But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,<br>
When every one will give the time of day,<br>
He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,<br>
And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,<br>
Disdaining duty that to us belongs.<br>
Small curs are not regarded when they grin;<br>
But great men tremble when the lion roars;<br>
And Humphrey is no little man in England.<br>
First note that he is near you in descent,<br>
And should you fall, he as the next will mount.<br>
Me seemeth then it is no policy,<br>
Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears<br>
And his advantage following your decease,<br>
That he should come about your royal person<br>
Or be admitted to your highness&#8217; council.<br>
By flattery hath he won the commons&#8217; hearts,<br>
And when he please to make commotion,<br>
&#8217;Tis to be fear&#8217;d they all will follow him.<br>
Now &#8217;tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;<br>
Suffer them now, and they&#8217;ll o&#8217;ergrow the garden<br>
And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.<br>
The reverent care I bear unto my lord<br>
Made me collect these dangers in the duke.<br>
If it be fond, call it a woman&#8217;s fear;<br>
Which fear if better reasons can supplant,<br>
I will subscribe and say I wrong&#8217;d the duke.<br>
My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,<br>
Reprove my allegation, if you can;<br>
Or else conclude my words effectual.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Well hath your highness seen into this duke;<br>
And, had I first been put to speak my mind,<br>
I think I should have told your grace&#8217;s tale.<br>
The duchess, by his subornation,<br>
Upon my life, began her devilish practises:<br>
Or, if he were not privy to those faults,<br>
Yet, by reputing of his high descent,<br>
As next the king he was successive heir,<br>
And such high vaunts of his nobility,<br>
Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess<br>
By wicked means to frame our sovereign&#8217;s fall.<br>
Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;<br>
And in his simple show he harbours treason.<br>
The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.<br>
No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man<br>
Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">Did he not, contrary to form of law,<br>
Devise strange deaths for small offences done?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">And did he not, in his protectorship,<br>
Levy great sums of money through the realm<br>
For soldiers&#8217; pay in France, and never sent it?<br>
By means whereof the towns each day revolted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, these are petty faults to faults
unknown.<br>
Which time will bring to light in smooth<br>
Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, at once: the care you have of us,<br>
To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,<br>
Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,<br>
Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent<br>
From meaning treason to our royal person<br>
As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:<br>
The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given<br>
To dream on evil or to work my downfall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, what&#8217;s more dangerous than this fond
affiance!<br>
Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,<br>
For he&#8217;s disposed as the hateful raven:<br>
Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,<br>
For he&#8217;s inclined as is the ravenous wolf.<br>
Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?<br>
Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all<br>
Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Somerset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">All health unto my gracious sovereign!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from
France?</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">That all your interest in those territories<br>
Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God&#8217;s will be
done!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Cold news for
me; for I had hope of France<br>
As firmly as I hope for fertile England.<br>
Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud<br>
And caterpillars eat my leaves away;<br>
But I will remedy this gear ere long,<br>
Or sell my title for a glorious grave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">All happiness unto my lord the king!<br>
Pardon, my liege, that I have stay&#8217;d so long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too
soon,<br>
Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:<br>
I do arrest thee of high treason here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush<br>
Nor change my countenance for this arrest:<br>
A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.<br>
The purest spring is not so free from mud<br>
As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:<br>
Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes
of France,<br>
And, being protector, stayed the soldiers&#8217; pay;<br>
By means whereof his highness hath lost France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Is it but thought so? what are they that think
it?<br>
I never robb&#8217;d the soldiers of their pay,<br>
Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.<br>
So help me God, as I have watch&#8217;d the night,<br>
Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,<br>
That doit that e&#8217;er I wrested from the king,<br>
Or any groat I hoarded to my use,<br>
Be brought against me at my trial-day!<br>
No; many a pound of mine own proper store,<br>
Because I would not tax the needy commons,<br>
Have I disbursed to the garrisons,<br>
And never ask&#8217;d for restitution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I say no more than truth, so help me God!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">In your protectorship you did devise<br>
Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,<br>
That England was defamed by tyranny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis well known that, whiles I was
protector,<br>
Pity was all the fault that was in me;<br>
For I should melt at an offender&#8217;s tears,<br>
And lowly words were ransom for their fault.<br>
Unless it were a bloody murderer,<br>
Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,<br>
I never gave them condign punishment:<br>
Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured<br>
Above the felon or what trespass else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, these faults are easy, quickly
answered:<br>
But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,<br>
Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.<br>
I do arrest you in his highness&#8217; name;<br>
And here commit you to my lord cardinal<br>
To keep, until your further time of trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Gloucester, &#8217;tis my special
hope<br>
That you will clear yourself from all suspect:<br>
My conscience tells me you are innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:<br>
Virtue is choked with foul ambition<br>
And charity chased hence by rancour&#8217;s hand;<br>
Foul subornation is predominant<br>
And equity exiled your highness&#8217; land.<br>
I know their complot is to have my life,<br>
And if my death might make this island happy,<br>
And prove the period of their tyranny,<br>
I would expend it with all willingness:<br>
But mine is made the prologue to their play;<br>
For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,<br>
Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.<br>
Beaufort&#8217;s red sparkling eyes blab his heart&#8217;s
malice,<br>
And Suffolk&#8217;s cloudy brow his stormy hate;<br>
Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue<br>
The envious load that lies upon his heart;<br>
And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,<br>
Whose overweening arm I have pluck&#8217;d back,<br>
By false accuse doth level at my life:<br>
And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,<br>
Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,<br>
And with your best endeavour have stirr&#8217;d up<br>
My liefest liege to be mine enemy:<br>
Ay, all you have laid your heads together&#8212;<br>
Myself had notice of your conventicles&#8212;<br>
And all to make away my guiltless life.<br>
I shall not want false witness to condemn me,<br>
Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;<br>
The ancient proverb will be well effected:<br>
&#8216;A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, his railing is intolerable:<br>
If those that care to keep your royal person<br>
From treason&#8217;s secret knife and traitors&#8217; rage<br>
Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,<br>
And the offender granted scope of speech,<br>
&#8217;Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here<br>
With ignominious words, though clerkly couch&#8217;d,<br>
As if she had suborned some to swear<br>
False allegations to o&#8217;erthrow his state?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">But I can give the loser leave to chide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;<br>
Beshrew the winners, for they play&#8217;d me false!<br>
And well such losers may have leave to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll wrest the sense and hold us here all
day:<br>
Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch<br>
Before his legs be firm to bear his body.<br>
Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,<br>
And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.<br>
Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!<br>
For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, guarded</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,<br>
Do or undo, as if ourself were here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What, will your highness leave the
parliament?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown&#8217;d with
grief,<br>
Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,<br>
My body round engirt with misery,<br>
For what&#8217;s more miserable than discontent?<br>
Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see<br>
The map of honour, truth and loyalty:<br>
And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come<br>
That e&#8217;er I proved thee false or fear&#8217;d thy faith.<br>
What louring star now envies thy estate,<br>
That these great lords and Margaret our queen<br>
Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?<br>
Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;<br>
And as the butcher takes away the calf<br>
And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,<br>
Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,<br>
Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;<br>
And as the dam runs lowing up and down,<br>
Looking the way her harmless young one went,<br>
And can do nought but wail her darling&#8217;s loss,<br>
Even so myself bewails good Gloucester&#8217;s case<br>
With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm&#8217;d eyes<br>
Look after him and cannot do him good,<br>
So mighty are his vowed enemies.<br>
His fortunes I will weep; and, &#8217;twixt each groan<br>
Say &#8216;Who&#8217;s a traitor? Gloucester he is none.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Queen
Margaret, Cardinal, Suffolk, and York; Somerset remains
apart</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun&#8217;s
hot beams.<br>
Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,<br>
Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester&#8217;s show<br>
Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile<br>
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,<br>
Or as the snake roll&#8217;d in a flowering bank,<br>
With shining chequer&#8217;d slough, doth sting a child<br>
That for the beauty thinks it excellent.<br>
Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I&#8212;<br>
And yet herein I judge mine own wit good&#8212;<br>
This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,<br>
To rid us of the fear we have of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">That he should die is worthy policy;<br>
But yet we want a colour for his death:<br>
&#8217;Tis meet he be condemn&#8217;d by course of law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">But, in my mind, that were no policy:<br>
The king will labour still to save his life,<br>
The commons haply rise, to save his life;<br>
And yet we have but trivial argument,<br>
More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">So that, by this, you would not have him die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis York that hath more reason for his
death.<br>
But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,<br>
Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,<br>
Were&#8217;t not all one, an empty eagle were set<br>
To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,<br>
As place Duke Humphrey for the king&#8217;s protector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">So the poor chicken should be sure of death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, &#8217;tis true; and were&#8217;t not
madness, then,<br>
To make the fox surveyor of the fold?<br>
Who being accused a crafty murderer,<br>
His guilt should be but idly posted over,<br>
Because his purpose is not executed.<br>
No; let him die, in that he is a fox,<br>
By nature proved an enemy to the flock,<br>
Before his chaps be stain&#8217;d with crimson blood,<br>
As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.<br>
And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:<br>
Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,<br>
Sleeping or waking, &#8217;tis no matter how,<br>
So he be dead; for that is good deceit<br>
Which mates him first that first intends deceit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Thrice-noble Suffolk, &#8217;tis resolutely
spoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Not resolute, except so much were done;<br>
For things are often spoke and seldom meant:<br>
But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,<br>
Seeing the deed is meritorious,<br>
And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,<br>
Say but the word, and I will be his priest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">But I would have him dead, my Lord of
Suffolk,<br>
Ere you can take due orders for a priest:<br>
Say you consent and censure well the deed,<br>
And I&#8217;ll provide his executioner,<br>
I tender so the safety of my liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And so say I.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">And I and now we three have spoke it,<br>
It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Post</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Post</p>
<p class="speech">Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,<br>
To signify that rebels there are up<br>
And put the Englishmen unto the sword:<br>
Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,<br>
Before the wound do grow uncurable;<br>
For, being green, there is great hope of help.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!<br>
What counsel give you in this weighty cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">That Somerset be sent as regent thither:<br>
&#8217;Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ&#8217;d;<br>
Witness the fortune he hath had in France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">If York, with all his far-fet policy,<br>
Had been the regent there instead of me,<br>
He never would have stay&#8217;d in France so long.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:<br>
I rather would have lost my life betimes<br>
Than bring a burthen of dishonour home<br>
By staying there so long till all were lost.<br>
Show me one scar character&#8217;d on thy skin:<br>
Men&#8217;s flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging
fire,<br>
If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:<br>
No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:<br>
Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,<br>
Might happily have proved far worse than his.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take
all!</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.<br>
The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms<br>
And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:<br>
To Ireland will you lead a band of men,<br>
Collected choicely, from each county some,<br>
And try your hap against the Irishmen?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord, so please his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Why, our authority is his consent,<br>
And what we do establish he confirms:<br>
Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,<br>
Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">A charge, Lord York, that I will see
perform&#8217;d.<br>
But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">No more of him; for I will deal with him<br>
That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.<br>
And so break off; the day is almost spent:<br>
Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days<br>
At Bristol I expect my soldiers;<br>
For there I&#8217;ll ship them all for Ireland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see it truly done, my Lord of
York.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
York</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful
thoughts,<br>
And change misdoubt to resolution:<br>
Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art<br>
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:<br>
Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,<br>
And find no harbour in a royal heart.<br>
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
on thought,<br>
And not a thought but thinks on dignity.<br>
My brain more busy than the labouring spider<br>
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.<br>
Well, nobles, well, &#8217;tis politicly done,<br>
To send me packing with an host of men:<br>
I fear me you but warm the starved snake,<br>
Who, cherish&#8217;d in your breasts, will sting
your hearts.<br>
&#8217;Twas men I lack&#8217;d and you will give them me:<br>
I take it kindly; and yet be well assured<br>
You put sharp weapons in a madman&#8217;s hands.<br>
Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,<br>
I will stir up in England some black storm<br>
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;<br>
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage<br>
Until the golden circuit on my head,<br>
Like to the glorious sun&#8217;s transparent beams,<br>
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.<br>
And, for a minister of my intent,<br>
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,<br>
John Cade of Ashford,<br>
To make commotion, as full well he can,<br>
Under the title of John Mortimer.<br>
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade<br>
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,<br>
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts<br>
Were almost like a sharp-quill&#8217;d porpentine;<br>
And, in the end being rescued, I have seen<br>
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,<br>
Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.<br>
Full often, like a shag-hair&#8217;d crafty kern,<br>
Hath he conversed with the enemy,<br>
And undiscover&#8217;d come to me again<br>
And given me notice of their villanies.<br>
This devil here shall be my substitute;<br>
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,<br>
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:<br>
By this I shall perceive the commons&#8217; mind,<br>
How they affect the house and claim of York.<br>
Say he be taken, rack&#8217;d and tortured,<br>
I know no pain they can inflict upon him<br>
Will make him say I moved him to those arms.<br>
Say that he thrive, as &#8217;tis great like he will,<br>
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength<br>
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow&#8217;d;<br>
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,<br>
And Henry put apart, the next for me.</p>

hastily</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know<br>
We have dispatch&#8217;d the duke, as he commanded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">O that it were to do! What have we done?<br>
Didst ever hear a man so penitent?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Suffolk</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murder</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sirs, have you dispatch&#8217;d this
thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord, he&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s well said. Go, get you to my
house;<br>
I will reward you for this venturous deed.<br>
The king and all the peers are here at hand.<br>
Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,<br>
According as I gave directions?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Away! be gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Murderers</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sound trumpets. Enter King
Henry VI, Queen Margaret, Cardinal, Somerset, with
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;<br>
Say we intend to try his grace to-day.<br>
If he be guilty, as &#8217;tis published.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll call him presently, my noble lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,<br>
Proceed no straiter &#8217;gainst our uncle Gloucester<br>
Than from true evidence of good esteem<br>
He be approved in practise culpable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">God forbid any malice should prevail,<br>
That faultless may condemn a nobleman!<br>
Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, Meg; these words content me
much.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Suffolk</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! why look&#8217;st thou pale? why
tremblest thou?<br>
Where is our uncle? what&#8217;s the matter, Suffolk?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, God forfend!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s secret judgment: I did dream
to-night<br>
The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">King Henry VI
swoons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is
dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">He doth revive again: madam, be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O heavenly God!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">How fares my gracious lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry,
comfort!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?<br>
Came he right now to sing a raven&#8217;s note,<br>
Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;<br>
And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,<br>
By crying comfort from a hollow breast,<br>
Can chase away the first-conceived sound?<br>
Hide not thy poison with such sugar&#8217;d words;<br>
Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;<br>
Their touch affrights me as a serpent&#8217;s sting.<br>
Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!<br>
Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny<br>
Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.<br>
Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:<br>
Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,<br>
And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;<br>
For in the shade of death I shall find joy;<br>
In life but double death, now Gloucester&#8217;s dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?<br>
Although the duke was enemy to him,<br>
Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:<br>
And for myself, foe as he was to me,<br>
Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans<br>
Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,<br>
I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,<br>
Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,<br>
And all to have the noble duke alive.<br>
What know I how the world may deem of me?<br>
For it is known we were but hollow friends:<br>
It may be judged I made the duke away;<br>
So shall my name with slander&#8217;s tongue be wounded,<br>
And princes&#8217; courts be fill&#8217;d with my reproach.<br>
This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!<br>
To be a queen, and crown&#8217;d with infamy!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.<br>
What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?<br>
I am no loathsome leper; look on me.<br>
What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?<br>
Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.<br>
Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester&#8217;s tomb?<br>
Why, then, dame Margaret was ne&#8217;er thy joy.<br>
Erect his statue and worship it,<br>
And make my image but an alehouse sign.<br>
Was I for this nigh wreck&#8217;d upon the sea<br>
And twice by awkward wind from England&#8217;s bank<br>
Drove back again unto my native clime?<br>
What boded this, but well forewarning wind<br>
Did seem to say &#8216;seek not a scorpion&#8217;s nest,<br>
Nor set no footing on this unkind shore&#8217;?<br>
What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts<br>
And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:<br>
And bid them blow towards England&#8217;s blessed shore,<br>
Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock<br>
Yet Aeolus would not be a murderer,<br>
But left that hateful office unto thee:<br>
The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,<br>
Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown&#8217;d on shore,<br>
With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:<br>
The splitting rocks cower&#8217;d in the sinking sands<br>
And would not dash me with their ragged sides,<br>
Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,<br>
Might in thy palace perish Margaret.<br>
As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,<br>
When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,<br>
I stood upon the hatches in the storm,<br>
And when the dusky sky began to rob<br>
My earnest-gaping sight of thy land&#8217;s view,<br>
I took a costly jewel from my neck,<br>
A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,<br>
And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,<br>
And so I wish&#8217;d thy body might my heart:<br>
And even with this I lost fair England&#8217;s view<br>
And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart<br>
And call&#8217;d them blind and dusky spectacles,<br>
For losing ken of Albion&#8217;s wished coast.<br>
How often have I tempted Suffolk&#8217;s tongue,<br>
The agent of thy foul inconstancy,<br>
To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did<br>
When he to madding Dido would unfold<br>
His father&#8217;s acts commenced in burning Troy!<br>
Am I not witch&#8217;d like her? or thou not false like him?<br>
Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!<br>
For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Noise within. Enter Warwick,
Salisbury, and many Commons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">It is reported, mighty sovereign,<br>
That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder&#8217;d<br>
By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort&#8217;s means.<br>
The commons, like an angry hive of bees<br>
That want their leader, scatter up and down<br>
And care not who they sting in his revenge.<br>
Myself have calm&#8217;d their spleenful mutiny,<br>
Until they hear the order of his death.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">That he is dead, good Warwick, &#8217;tis too
true;<br>
But how he died God knows, not Henry:<br>
Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,<br>
And comment then upon his sudden death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,<br>
With the rude multitude till I return.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O Thou that judgest all things, stay my
thoughts,<br>
My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul<br>
Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey&#8217;s life!<br>
If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,<br>
For judgment only doth belong to thee.<br>
Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips<br>
With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain<br>
Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,<br>
To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,<br>
And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:<br>
But all in vain are these mean obsequies;<br>
And to survey his dead and earthly image,<br>
What were it but to make my sorrow greater?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Warwick and others,
bearing Gloucester&#8217;s body on a bed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this
body.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">That is to see how deep my grave is made;<br>
For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,<br>
For seeing him I see my life in death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">As surely as my soul intends to live<br>
With that dread King that took our state upon him<br>
To free us from his father&#8217;s wrathful curse,<br>
I do believe that violent hands were laid<br>
Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!<br>
What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">See how the blood is settled in his face.<br>
Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,<br>
Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,<br>
Being all descended to the labouring heart;<br>
Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,<br>
Attracts the same for aidance &#8217;gainst the enemy;<br>
Which with the heart there cools and ne&#8217;er returneth<br>
To blush and beautify the cheek again.<br>
But see, his face is black and full of blood,<br>
His eye-balls further out than when he lived,<br>
Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;<br>
His hair uprear&#8217;d, his nostrils stretched with
struggling;<br>
His hands abroad display&#8217;d, as one that grasp&#8217;d<br>
And tugg&#8217;d for life and was by strength subdued:<br>
Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;<br>
His well-proportion&#8217;d beard made rough and rugged,<br>
Like to the summer&#8217;s corn by tempest lodged.<br>
It cannot be but he was murder&#8217;d here;<br>
The least of all these signs were probable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to
death?<br>
Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;<br>
And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">But both of you were vow&#8217;d Duke
Humphrey&#8217;s foes,<br>
And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:<br>
&#8217;Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;<br>
And &#8217;tis well seen he found an enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen<br>
As guilty of Duke Humphrey&#8217;s timeless death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh<br>
And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,<br>
But will suspect &#8217;twas he that made the slaughter?<br>
Who finds the partridge in the puttock&#8217;s nest,<br>
But may imagine how the bird was dead,<br>
Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?<br>
Even so suspicious is this tragedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where&#8217;s your
knife?<br>
Is Beaufort term&#8217;d a kite? Where are his talons?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;<br>
But here&#8217;s a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,<br>
That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart<br>
That slanders me with murder&#8217;s crimson badge.<br>
Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,<br>
That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Cardinal, Somerset,
and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">He dares not calm his contumelious spirit<br>
Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,<br>
Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;<br>
For every word you speak in his behalf<br>
Is slander to your royal dignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!<br>
If ever lady wrong&#8217;d her lord so much,<br>
Thy mother took into her blameful bed<br>
Some stern untutor&#8217;d churl, and noble stock<br>
Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,<br>
And never of the Nevils&#8217; noble race.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee<br>
And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,<br>
Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,<br>
And that my sovereign&#8217;s presence makes me mild,<br>
I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee<br>
Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,<br>
And say it was thy mother that thou meant&#8217;st<br>
That thou thyself was born in bastardy;<br>
And after all this fearful homage done,<br>
Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,<br>
Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,<br>
If from this presence thou darest go with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:<br>
Unworthy though thou art, I&#8217;ll cope with thee<br>
And do some service to Duke Humphrey&#8217;s ghost.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Suffolk and
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">What stronger breastplate than a heart
untainted!<br>
Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,<br>
And he but naked, though lock&#8217;d up in steel<br>
Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A noise within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What noise is this?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Suffolk and Warwick,
with their weapons drawn</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons
drawn<br>
Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?<br>
Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury<br>
Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To the Commons,
entering]</span> Sirs, stand apart; the king shall know your mind.<br>
Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,<br>
Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,<br>
Or banished fair England&#8217;s territories,<br>
They will by violence tear him from your palace<br>
And torture him with grievous lingering death.<br>
They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;<br>
They say, in him they fear your highness&#8217; death;<br>
And mere instinct of love and loyalty,<br>
Free from a stubborn opposite intent,<br>
As being thought to contradict your liking,<br>
Makes them thus forward in his banishment.<br>
They say, in care of your most royal person,<br>
That if your highness should intend to sleep<br>
And charge that no man should disturb your rest<br>
In pain of your dislike or pain of death,<br>
Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,<br>
Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,<br>
That slily glided towards your majesty,<br>
It were but necessary you were waked,<br>
Lest, being suffer&#8217;d in that harmful slumber,<br>
The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;<br>
And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,<br>
That they will guard you, whether you will or no,<br>
From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,<br>
With whose envenomed and fatal sting,<br>
Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,<br>
They say, is shamefully bereft of life.</p>

Could send such message to their sovereign:<br>
But you, my lord, were glad to be employ&#8217;d,<br>
To show how quaint an orator you are:<br>

And had I not been cited so by them,<br>

Mischance unto my state by Suffolk&#8217;s means:<br>

If, after three days&#8217; space, thou here be&#8217;st found<br>

And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>

And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!<br>
Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse
them?<br>
Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake&#8217;s groan,<br>
I would invent as bitter-searching terms,<br>
As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,<br>
Deliver&#8217;d strongly through my fixed teeth,<br>
With full as many signs of deadly hate,<br>
As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:<br>
My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;<br>
Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;<br>
Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;<br>
Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:<br>
And even now my burthen&#8217;d heart would break,<br>
Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!<br>
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!<br>
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!<br>
Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!<br>
Their softest touch as smart as lizards&#8217; sting!<br>
Their music frightful as the serpent&#8217;s hiss,<br>
And boding screech-owls make the concert full!<br>
All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment&#8217;st
thyself;<br>
And these dread curses, like the sun &#8217;gainst glass,<br>
Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,<br>
And turn the force of them upon thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?<br>
Now, by the ground that I am banish&#8217;d from,<br>
Well could I curse away a winter&#8217;s night,<br>
Though standing naked on a mountain top,<br>
Where biting cold would never let grass grow,<br>
And think it but a minute spent in sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy
hand,<br>
That I may dew it with my mournful tears;<br>
Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,<br>
To wash away my woful monuments.<br>
O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,<br>
That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,<br>
Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!<br>
So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;<br>
&#8217;Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,<br>
As one that surfeits thinking on a want.<br>
I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,<br>
Adventure to be banished myself:<br>
And banished I am, if but from thee.<br>
Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.<br>
O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn&#8217;d<br>
Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,<br>
Loather a hundred times to part than die.<br>
Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;<br>
Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.<br>
&#8217;Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;<br>
A wilderness is populous enough,<br>
So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:<br>
For where thou art, there is the world itself,<br>
With every several pleasure in the world,<br>
And where thou art not, desolation.<br>
I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;<br>
Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Vaux</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I
prithee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vaux</p>
<p class="speech">To signify unto his majesty<br>
That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;<br>
For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,<br>
That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,<br>
Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.<br>
Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey&#8217;s ghost<br>
Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,<br>
And whispers to his pillow, as to him,<br>
The secrets of his overcharged soul;<br>
And I am sent to tell his majesty<br>
That even now he cries aloud for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Go tell this heavy message to the king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Vaux</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! what is this world! what news are
these!<br>
But wherefore grieve I at an hour&#8217;s poor loss,<br>
Omitting Suffolk&#8217;s exile, my soul&#8217;s treasure?<br>
Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,<br>
And with the southern clouds contend in tears,<br>
Theirs for the earth&#8217;s increase, mine for my sorrows?<br>
Now get thee hence: the king, thou know&#8217;st, is coming;<br>
If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">If I depart from thee, I cannot live;<br>
And in thy sight to die, what were it else<br>
But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?<br>
Here could I breathe my soul into the air,<br>
As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe<br>
Dying with mother&#8217;s dug between its lips:<br>
Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,<br>
And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,<br>
To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;<br>
So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,<br>
Or I should breathe it so into thy body,<br>
And then it lived in sweet Elysium.<br>
To die by thee were but to die in jest;<br>
From thee to die were torture more than death:<br>
O, let me stay, befall what may befall!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,<br>
It is applied to a deathful wound.<br>
To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;<br>
For wheresoe&#8217;er thou art in this world&#8217;s globe,<br>
I&#8217;ll have an Iris that shall find thee out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">I go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And take my heart with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">A jewel, lock&#8217;d into the wofull&#8217;st
cask<br>
That ever did contain a thing of worth.<br>
Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we<br>
This way fall I to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">This way for me.</p>

<h4>Scene III. A bedchamber.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the King, Salisbury,
Warwick, to the Cardinal in bed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to
thy sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">If thou be&#8217;st death, I&#8217;ll give thee
England&#8217;s treasure,<br>
Enough to purchase such another island,<br>
So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,<br>
Where death&#8217;s approach is seen so terrible!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">Bring me unto my trial when you will.<br>
Died he not in his bed? where should he die?<br>
Can I make men live, whether they will or no?<br>
O, torture me no more! I will confess.<br>
Alive again? then show me where he is:<br>
I&#8217;ll give a thousand pound to look upon him.<br>
He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.<br>
Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,<br>
Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.<br>
Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary<br>
Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.<br>
Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!<br>
O, beat away the busy meddling fiend<br>
That lays strong siege unto this wretch&#8217;s soul.<br>
And from his bosom purge this black despair!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Peace to his soul, if God&#8217;s good pleasure
be!<br>
Lord cardinal, if thou think&#8217;st on heaven&#8217;s bliss,<br>
Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.<br>
He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">So bad a death argues a monstrous life.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.<br>
Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;<br>
And let us all to meditation.</p>
