<h4>Scene I. An apartment in the Duke&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Vincentio,
Escalus, Lords and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Escalus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Of government the properties to unfold,<br>
Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;<br>
Since I am put to know that your own science<br>
Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice<br>
My strength can give you: then no more remains,<br>
But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,<br>
And let them work. The nature of our people,<br>
Our city&#8217;s institutions, and the terms<br>
For common justice, you&#8217;re as pregnant in<br>
As art and practise hath enriched any<br>
That we remember. There is our commission,<br>
From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,<br>
I say, bid come before us Angelo.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">What figure of us think you he will bear?<br>
For you must know, we have with special soul<br>
Elected him our absence to supply,<br>
Lent him our terror, dress&#8217;d him with our love,<br>
And given his deputation all the organs<br>
Of our own power: what think you of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">If any in Vienna be of worth<br>
To undergo such ample grace and honour,<br>
It is Lord Angelo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Look where he comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Angelo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Always obedient to your grace&#8217;s will,<br>
I come to know your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Angelo,<br>
There is a kind of character in thy life,<br>
That to the observer doth thy history<br>
Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings<br>
Are not thine own so proper as to waste<br>
Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.<br>
Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,<br>
Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues<br>
Did not go forth of us, &#8217;twere all alike<br>
As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch&#8217;d<br>
But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends<br>
The smallest scruple of her excellence<br>
But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines<br>
Herself the glory of a creditor,<br>
Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech<br>
To one that can my part in him advertise;<br>
Hold therefore, Angelo:&#8212;<br>
In our remove be thou at full ourself;<br>
Mortality and mercy in Vienna<br>
Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,<br>
Though first in question, is thy secondary.<br>
Take thy commission.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Now, good my lord,<br>
Let there be some more test made of my metal,<br>
Before so noble and so great a figure<br>
Be stamp&#8217;d upon it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">No more evasion:<br>
We have with a leaven&#8217;d and prepared choice<br>
Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.<br>
Our haste from hence is of so quick condition<br>
That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion&#8217;d<br>
Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,<br>
As time and our concernings shall importune,<br>
How it goes with us, and do look to know<br>
What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;<br>
To the hopeful execution do I leave you<br>
Of your commissions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Yet give leave, my lord,<br>
That we may bring you something on the way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">My haste may not admit it;<br>
Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do<br>
With any scruple; your scope is as mine own<br>
So to enforce or qualify the laws<br>
As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:<br>
I&#8217;ll privily away. I love the people,<br>
But do not like to stage me to their eyes:<br>
Through it do well, I do not relish well<br>
Their loud applause and Aves vehement;<br>
Nor do I think the man of safe discretion<br>
That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">The heavens give safety to your purposes!</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave<br>
To have free speech with you; and it concerns me<br>
To look into the bottom of my place:<br>
A power I have, but of what strength and nature<br>
I am not yet instructed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so with me. Let us withdraw
together,<br>
And we may soon our satisfaction have<br>
Touching that point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll wait upon your honour.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A Street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucio and two
Gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">If the duke with the other dukes come not to
composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
the dukes fall upon the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King
of<br>
Hungary&#8217;s!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate,
that
went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
one out of the table.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Thou shalt not steal&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that he razed.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;twas a commandment to command the
captain and
all the rest from their functions: they put forth
to steal. There&#8217;s not a soldier of us all, that, in
the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
well that prays for peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I never heard any soldier dislike it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I believe thee; for I think thou never wast
where
grace was said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No? a dozen times at least.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">What, in metre?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">In any proportion or in any language.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I think, or in any religion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
wicked villain, despite of all grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Well, there went but a pair of shears between
us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I grant; as there may between the lists and
the
velvet. Thou art the list.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet;
thou&#8217;rt
a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
feelingly now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most
painful
feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
live, forget to drink after thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or
free.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes!
I
have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come
to&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">To what, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Judge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">To three thousand dolours a year.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">A French crown more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but
thou
art full of error; I am sound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound
as
things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
impiety has made a feast of thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mistress
Overdone</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">How now! which of your hips has the most profound
sciatica?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well; there&#8217;s one yonder arrested and
carried
to prison was worth five thousand of you all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Who&#8217;s that, I pray thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, that&#8217;s Claudio, Signior
Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Claudio to prison? &#8217;tis not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but I know &#8217;tis so: I saw him
arrested, saw
him carried away; and, which is more, within these
three days his head to be chopped off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">But, after all this fooling, I would not have it
so.<br>
Art thou sure of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">I am too sure of it: and it is for getting
Madam<br>
Julietta with child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me
two
hours since, and he was ever precise in
promise-keeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, you know, it draws something near to
the
speech we had to such a purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">But, most of all, agreeing with the
proclamation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Away! let&#8217;s go learn the truth of it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucio and
Gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat,
what
with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
custom-shrunk.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pompey</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! what&#8217;s the news with you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder man is carried to prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Well; what has he done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">A woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">But what&#8217;s his offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">What, is there a maid with child by him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">No, but there&#8217;s a woman with maid by him.
You have
not heard of the proclamation, have you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">What proclamation, man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be
plucked down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">And what shall become of those in the city?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">They shall stand for seed: they had gone down
too,
but that a wise burgher put in for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs
be
pulled down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">To the ground, mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s a change indeed in the
commonwealth!<br>
What shall become of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
clients: though you change your place, you need not
change your trade; I&#8217;ll be your tapster still.
Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
will be considered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s to do here, Thomas tapster?
let&#8217;s withdraw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost
to
prison; and there&#8217;s Madam Juliet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Provost, Claudio,
Juliet, and Officers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the
world?<br>
Bear me to prison, where I am committed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">I do it not in evil disposition,<br>
But from Lord Angelo by special charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus can the demigod Authority<br>
Make us pay down for our offence by weight<br>
The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;<br>
On whom it will not, so; yet still &#8217;tis just.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucio and two
Gentlemen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this
restraint?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:<br>
As surfeit is the father of much fast,<br>
So every scope by the immoderate use<br>
Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,<br>
Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,<br>
A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I
would
send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
as the morality of imprisonment. What&#8217;s thy
offence, Claudio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">What but to speak of would offend again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">What, is&#8217;t murder?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Lechery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Call it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Away, sir! you must go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">A hundred, if they&#8217;ll do you any good.<br>
Is lechery so look&#8217;d after?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract<br>
I got possession of Julietta&#8217;s bed:<br>
You know the lady; she is fast my wife,<br>
Save that we do the denunciation lack<br>
Of outward order: this we came not to,<br>
Only for propagation of a dower<br>
Remaining in the coffer of her friends,<br>
From whom we thought it meet to hide our love<br>
Till time had made them for us. But it chances<br>
The stealth of our most mutual entertainment<br>
With character too gross is writ on Juliet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">With child, perhaps?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappily, even so.<br>
And the new deputy now for the duke&#8212;<br>
Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,<br>
Or whether that the body public be<br>
A horse whereon the governor doth ride,<br>
Who, newly in the seat, that it may know<br>
He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;<br>
Whether the tyranny be in his place,<br>
Or in his emmence that fills it up,<br>
I stagger in:&#8212;but this new governor<br>
Awakes me all the enrolled penalties<br>
Which have, like unscour&#8217;d armour, hung by the wall<br>
So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round<br>
And none of them been worn; and, for a name,<br>
Now puts the drowsy and neglected act<br>
Freshly on me: &#8217;tis surely for a name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle
on
thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I have done so, but he&#8217;s not to be
found.<br>
I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:<br>
This day my sister should the cloister enter<br>
And there receive her approbation:<br>
Acquaint her with the danger of my state:<br>
Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends<br>
To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:<br>
I have great hope in that; for in her youth<br>
There is a prone and speechless dialect,<br>
Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art<br>
When she will play with reason and discourse,<br>
And well she can persuade.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of
the
like, which else would stand under grievous
imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
game of tick-tack. I&#8217;ll to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, good friend Lucio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>

<h4>Scene III. A monastery.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Vincentio and
Friar Thomas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">No, holy father; throw away that thought;<br>
Believe not that the dribbling dart of love<br>
Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee<br>
To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose<br>
More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends<br>
Of burning youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Thomas</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;May your grace speak of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">My holy sir, none better knows than you<br>
How I have ever loved the life removed<br>
And held in idle price to haunt assemblies<br>
Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.<br>
I have deliver&#8217;d to Lord Angelo,<br>
A man of stricture and firm abstinence,<br>
My absolute power and place here in Vienna,<br>
And he supposes me travell&#8217;d to Poland;<br>
For so I have strew&#8217;d it in the common ear,<br>
And so it is received. Now, pious sir,<br>
You will demand of me why I do this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Thomas</p>
<p class="speech">Gladly, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">We have strict statutes and most biting laws.<br>
The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,<br>
Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;<br>
Even like an o&#8217;ergrown lion in a cave,<br>
That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,<br>
Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,<br>
Only to stick it in their children&#8217;s sight<br>
For terror, not to use, in time the rod<br>
Becomes more mock&#8217;d than fear&#8217;d; so our decrees,<br>
Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;<br>
And liberty plucks justice by the nose;<br>
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart<br>
Goes all decorum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Thomas</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;It rested in your grace<br>
To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:<br>
And it in you more dreadful would have seem&#8217;d<br>
Than in Lord Angelo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I do fear, too dreadful:<br>
Sith &#8217;twas my fault to give the people scope,<br>
&#8217;Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them<br>
For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,<br>
When evil deeds have their permissive pass<br>
And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,<br>
I have on Angelo imposed the office;<br>
Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,<br>
And yet my nature never in the fight<br>
To do in slander. And to behold his sway,<br>
I will, as &#8217;twere a brother of your order,<br>
Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,<br>
Supply me with the habit and instruct me<br>
How I may formally in person bear me<br>
Like a true friar. More reasons for this action<br>
At our more leisure shall I render you;<br>
Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;<br>
Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses<br>
That his blood flows, or that his appetite<br>
Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,<br>
If power change purpose, what our seemers be.</p>

<p class="speech">Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets

Not to be weary with you, he&#8217;s in prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Woe me! for what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">For that which, if myself might be his judge,<br>
He should receive his punishment in thanks:<br>
He hath got his friend with child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, make me not your story.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">It is true.<br>
I would not&#8212;though &#8217;tis my familiar sin<br>
With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,<br>
Tongue far from heart&#8212;play with all virgins so:<br>
I hold you as a thing ensky&#8217;d and sainted.<br>
By your renouncement an immortal spirit,<br>
And to be talk&#8217;d with in sincerity,<br>
As with a saint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, &#8217;tis
thus:<br>
Your brother and his lover have embraced:<br>
As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time<br>
That from the seedness the bare fallow brings<br>
To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb<br>
Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Is she your cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names<br>

<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">She it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O, let him marry her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">This is the point.<br>
The duke is very strangely gone from hence;<br>
Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,<br>
In hand and hope of action: but we do learn<br>
By those that know the very nerves of state,<br>
His givings-out were of an infinite distance<br>
From his true-meant design. Upon his place,<br>
And with full line of his authority,<br>
Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood<br>
Is very snow-broth; one who never feels<br>
The wanton stings and motions of the sense,<br>
But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge<br>
With profits of the mind, study and fast.<br>
He&#8212;to give fear to use and liberty,<br>
Which have for long run by the hideous law,<br>
As mice by lions&#8212;hath pick&#8217;d out an act,<br>
Under whose heavy sense your brother&#8217;s life<br>
Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;<br>
And follows close the rigour of the statute,<br>
To make him an example. All hope is gone,<br>
Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer<br>
To soften Angelo: and that&#8217;s my pith of business<br>
&#8217;Twixt you and your poor brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Doth he so seek his life?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Has censured him<br>
Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath<br>
A warrant for his execution.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>

To do him good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Assay the power you have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">My power? Alas, I doubt&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Our doubts are traitors<br>
And make us lose the good we oft might win<br>
By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,<br>
And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,<br>
Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,<br>
All their petitions are as freely theirs<br>
As they themselves would owe them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see what I can do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">But speedily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I will about it straight;<br>
No longer staying but to give the mother<br>
Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:<br>
Commend me to my brother: soon at night<br>

Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">We must not make a scarecrow of the law,<br>
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,<br>
And let it keep one shape, till custom make it<br>
Their perch and not their terror.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but yet<br>
Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,<br>
Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman<br>
Whom I would save, had a most noble father!<br>
Let but your honour know,<br>
Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,<br>
That, in the working of your own affections,<br>
Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,<br>
Or that the resolute acting of your blood<br>
Could have attain&#8217;d the effect of your own purpose,<br>
Whether you had not sometime in your life<br>
Err&#8217;d in this point which now you censure him,<br>
And pull&#8217;d the law upon you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,<br>
Another thing to fall. I not deny,<br>
The jury, passing on the prisoner&#8217;s life,<br>
May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two<br>
Guiltier than him they try. What&#8217;s open made to justice,<br>
That justice seizes: what know the laws<br>
That thieves do pass on thieves? &#8217;Tis very pregnant,<br>
The jewel that we find, we stoop and take&#8217;t<br>
Because we see it; but what we do not see<br>
We tread upon, and never think of it.<br>
You may not so extenuate his offence<br>
For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,<br>
When I, that censure him, do so offend,<br>

what&#8217;s the matter?</p>

constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
honour two notorious benefactors.</p>

are
they not malefactors?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">If it? please your honour, I know not well what

are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
of; and void of all profanation in the world that

<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">What are you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one
that
serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">How know you that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and
your honour,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">How? thy wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest
woman,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou detest her therefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well
as
she, that this house, if it be not a bawd&#8217;s house,
it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou know that, constable?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a
woman
cardinally given, might have been accused in
fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">By the woman&#8217;s means?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone&#8217;s means: but
as she
spit in his face, so she defied him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, if it please your honour, this is not
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Prove it before these varlets here, thou
honourable
man; prove it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear how he misplaces?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, she came in great with child; and
longing,
saving your honour&#8217;s reverence, for stewed prunes;
sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
good dishes,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein
in
the right: but to the point. As I say, this
Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
not give you three-pence again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Very well: you being then, if you be
remembered,
cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so I did indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
good diet, as I told you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">All this is true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well, then,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose.
What
was done to Elbow&#8217;s wife, that he hath cause to
complain of? Come me to what was done to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, nor I mean it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, but you shall come to it, by your
honour&#8217;s
leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
father died at Hallowmas: was&#8217;t not at Hallowmas,
Master Froth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">All-hallond eve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He,
sir,
sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; &#8217;twas in
the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
to sit, have you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">I have so; because it is an open room and good
for winter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">This will last out a night in Russia,<br>
When nights are longest there: I&#8217;ll take my leave.<br>
And leave you to the hearing of the cause;<br>
Hoping you&#8217;ll find good cause to whip them all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">I think no less. Good morrow to your
lordship.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Angelo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow&#8217;s
wife, once more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Once, sir? there was nothing done to her
once.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to
my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your honour, ask me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech you, sir, look in this
gentleman&#8217;s face.
Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; &#8217;tis for a
good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Doth your honour see any harm in his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be supposed upon a book, his face is
the worst
thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
constable&#8217;s wife any harm? I would know that of
your honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s in the right. Constable, what say you
to it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">First, an it like you, the house is a
respected
house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
mistress is a respected woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">By this hand, sir, his wife is a more
respected
person than any of us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet!
the
time has yet to come that she was ever respected
with man, woman, or child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, she was respected with him before he married
with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity?
Is
this true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
with me, let not your worship think me the poor
duke&#8217;s officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
I&#8217;ll have mine action of battery on thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">If he took you a box o&#8217; the ear, you might
have your
action of slander too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What
is&#8217;t
your worship&#8217;s pleasure I shall do with this wicked
caitiff?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in
him
that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest,
thou
wicked varlet, now, what&#8217;s come upon thee: thou art
to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>

<p class="speech">Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
more of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Froth</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your worship. For mine own part, I
never
come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Froth</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come you hither to me, Master tapster.
What&#8217;s your
name, Master tapster?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Pompey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">What else?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Bum, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about
you;
so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would
live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd?
What
do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">If the law would allow it, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it
shall
not be allowed in Vienna.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Does your worship mean to geld and splay all
the
youth of the city?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Pompey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will
to&#8217;t then.
If your worship will take order for the drabs and
the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell
you:
it is but heading and hanging.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">If you head and hang all that offend that way
but
for ten year together, you&#8217;ll be glad to give out a
commission for more heads: if this law hold in
Vienna ten year, I&#8217;ll rent the fairest house in it
after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
come to pass, say Pompey told you so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of
your
prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your worship for your good counsel:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune
shall
better determine.<br>
Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:<br>
The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither,
Master
constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Seven year and a half, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">I thought, by your readiness in the office, you
had
continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">And a half, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do
you
wrong to put you so oft upon &#8217;t: are there not men
in your ward sufficient to serve it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as
they
are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
do it for some piece of money, and go through with
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Look you bring me in the names of some six or
seven,
the most sufficient of your parish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">To your worship&#8217;s house, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">To my house. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Elbow</span></p>

<p class="speech">I pray you home to dinner with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Justice</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly thank you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">It grieves me for the death of Claudio;<br>
But there&#8217;s no remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Justice</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Angelo is severe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">It is but needful:<br>
Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;<br>
Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:<br>
But yet,&#8212;poor Claudio! There is no remedy.<br>
Come, sir.</p>

spare him!<br>
He&#8217;s not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens<br>

With less respect than we do minister<br>
To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;<br>
Who is it that hath died for this offence?<br>

<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Isabella]</span>
Ay, well said.</p>

slept:<br>
Those many had not dared to do that evil,<br>
If the first that did the edict infringe<br>
Had answer&#8217;d for his deed: now &#8217;tis awake<br>
Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,<br>
Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,<br>
Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,<br>
And so in progress to be hatch&#8217;d and born,<br>
Are now to have no successive degrees,<br>
But, ere they live, to end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Yet show some pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I show it most of all when I show justice;<br>
For then I pity those I do not know,<br>
Which a dismiss&#8217;d offence would after gall;<br>
And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,<br>
Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;<br>
Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">So you must be the first that gives this
sentence,<br>
And he, that suffer&#8217;s. O, it is excellent<br>
To have a giant&#8217;s strength; but it is tyrannous<br>
To use it like a giant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Isabella]</span>

<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Could great men thunder<br>
As Jove himself does, Jove would ne&#8217;er be quiet,<br>

Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,<br>
Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt<br>
Split&#8217;st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak<br>
Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,<br>
Drest in a little brief authority,<br>
Most ignorant of what he&#8217;s most assured,<br>
His glassy essence, like an angry ape,<br>
Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven<br>
As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,<br>

<p class="speech">Why do you put these sayings upon me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Because authority, though it err like others,<br>
Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,<br>
That skins the vice o&#8217; the top. Go to your bosom;<br>
Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know<br>
That&#8217;s like my brother&#8217;s fault: if it confess<br>
A natural guiltiness such as is his,<br>

Ha!<br>
Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I<br>
That, lying by the violet in the sun,<br>
Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,<br>
Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be<br>
That modesty may more betray our sense<br>
Than woman&#8217;s lightness? Having waste ground enough,<br>

And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!<br>
What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?<br>
Dost thou desire her foully for those things<br>
That make her good? O, let her brother live!<br>
Thieves for their robbery have authority<br>
When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,<br>
That I desire to hear her speak again,<br>
And feast upon her eyes? What is&#8217;t I dream on?<br>
O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,<br>
With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous<br>
Is that temptation that doth goad us on<br>
To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,<br>
With all her double vigour, art and nature,<br>
Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid<br>
Subdues me quite. Even till now,<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Angelo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">When I would pray and think, I think and pray<br>
To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;<br>
Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,<br>
Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,<br>
As if I did but only chew his name;<br>
And in my heart the strong and swelling evil<br>
Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied<br>
Is like a good thing, being often read,<br>
Grown fear&#8217;d and tedious; yea, my gravity,<br>
Wherein&#8212;let no man hear me&#8212;I take pride,<br>
Could I with boot change for an idle plume,<br>
Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,<br>
How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,<br>
Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls<br>
To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:<br>
Let&#8217;s write good angel on the devil&#8217;s horn:<br>
&#8217;Tis not the devil&#8217;s crest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Teach her the way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">O heavens!<br>
Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,<br>
Making both it unable for itself,<br>
And dispossessing all my other parts<br>
Of necessary fitness?<br>
So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;<br>
Come all to help him, and so stop the air<br>
By which he should revive: and even so<br>
The general, subject to a well-wish&#8217;d king,<br>
Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness<br>
Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love<br>
Must needs appear offence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Isabella</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, fair maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I am come to know your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">That you might know it, would much better please
me<br>
Than to demand what &#8217;tis. Your brother cannot live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Even so. Heaven keep your honour!</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,<br>
As long as you or I; yet he must die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Under your sentence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Yea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,<br>
Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted<br>
That his soul sicken not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good<br>
To pardon him that hath from nature stolen<br>
A man already made, as to remit<br>
Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven&#8217;s image<br>
In stamps that are forbid: &#8217;tis all as easy<br>
Falsely to take away a life true made<br>
As to put metal in restrained means<br>
To make a false one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis set down so in heaven, but not in
earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.<br>
Which had you rather, that the most just law<br>
Now took your brother&#8217;s life; or, to redeem him,<br>
Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness<br>
As she that he hath stain&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, believe this,<br>
I had rather give my body than my soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I talk not of your soul: our compell&#8217;d
sins<br>
Stand more for number than for accompt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">How say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I&#8217;ll not warrant that; for I can
speak<br>
Against the thing I say. Answer to this:<br>
I, now the voice of the recorded law,<br>
Pronounce a sentence on your brother&#8217;s life:<br>
Might there not be a charity in sin<br>
To save this brother&#8217;s life?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Please you to do&#8217;t,<br>
I&#8217;ll take it as a peril to my soul,<br>
It is no sin at all, but charity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Pleased you to do&#8217;t at peril of your
soul,<br>
Were equal poise of sin and charity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">That I do beg his life, if it be sin,<br>
Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,<br>
If that be sin, I&#8217;ll make it my morn prayer<br>
To have it added to the faults of mine,<br>
And nothing of your answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but hear me.<br>
Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,<br>
Or seem so craftily; and that&#8217;s not good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,<br>
But graciously to know I am no better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright<br>
When it doth tax itself; as these black masks<br>
Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder<br>
Than beauty could, display&#8217;d. But mark me;<br>
To be received plain, I&#8217;ll speak more gross:<br>
Your brother is to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">So.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">And his offence is so, as it appears,<br>
Accountant to the law upon that pain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">True.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Admit no other way to save his life,&#8212;<br>
As I subscribe not that, nor any other,<br>
But in the loss of question,&#8212;that you, his sister,<br>
Finding yourself desired of such a person,<br>
Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,<br>
Could fetch your brother from the manacles<br>
Of the all-building law; and that there were<br>
No earthly mean to save him, but that either<br>
You must lay down the treasures of your body<br>
To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;<br>
What would you do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">As much for my poor brother as myself:<br>
That is, were I under the terms of death,<br>
The impression of keen whips I&#8217;ld wear as rubies,<br>
And strip myself to death, as to a bed<br>
That longing have been sick for, ere I&#8217;ld yield<br>
My body up to shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Then must your brother die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">And &#8217;twere the cheaper way:<br>
Better it were a brother died at once,<br>
Than that a sister, by redeeming him,<br>
Should die for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Were not you then as cruel as the sentence<br>
That you have slander&#8217;d so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Ignomy in ransom and free pardon<br>
Are of two houses: lawful mercy<br>
Is nothing kin to foul redemption.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You seem&#8217;d of late to make the law a
tyrant;<br>
And rather proved the sliding of your brother<br>
A merriment than a vice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,<br>
To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:<br>
I something do excuse the thing I hate,<br>
For his advantage that I dearly love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">We are all frail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Else let my brother die,<br>
If not a feodary, but only he<br>
Owe and succeed thy weakness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, women are frail too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, as the glasses where they view
themselves;<br>
Which are as easy broke as they make forms.<br>
Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar<br>
In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;<br>
For we are soft as our complexions are,<br>
And credulous to false prints.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">I think it well:<br>
And from this testimony of your own sex,&#8212;<br>
Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger<br>
Than faults may shake our frames,&#8212;let me be bold;<br>
I do arrest your words. Be that you are,<br>
That is, a woman; if you be more, you&#8217;re none;<br>
If you be one, as you are well express&#8217;d<br>
By all external warrants, show it now,<br>
By putting on the destined livery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,<br>
Let me entreat you speak the former language.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Plainly conceive, I love you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">My brother did love Juliet,<br>
And you tell me that he shall die for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I know your virtue hath a licence in&#8217;t,<br>
Which seems a little fouler than it is,<br>
To pluck on others.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, on mine honour,<br>
My words express my purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! little honour to be much believed,<br>
And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!<br>
I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for&#8217;t:<br>
Sign me a present pardon for my brother,<br>
Or with an outstretch&#8217;d throat I&#8217;ll tell the world
aloud<br>
What man thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Who will believe thee, Isabel?<br>
My unsoil&#8217;d name, the austereness of my life,<br>
My vouch against you, and my place i&#8217; the state,<br>
Will so your accusation overweigh,<br>
That you shall stifle in your own report<br>
And smell of calumny. I have begun,<br>
And now I give my sensual race the rein:<br>
Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;<br>
Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,<br>
That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother<br>
By yielding up thy body to my will;<br>
Or else he must not only die the death,<br>
But thy unkindness shall his death draw out<br>
To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,<br>
Or, by the affection that now guides me most,<br>
I&#8217;ll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,<br>
Say what you can, my false o&#8217;erweighs your true.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,<br>
Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,<br>
That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,<br>
Either of condemnation or approof;<br>
Bidding the law make court&#8217;sy to their will:<br>
Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,<br>
To follow as it draws! I&#8217;ll to my brother:<br>
Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,<br>
Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.<br>
That, had he twenty heads to tender down<br>
On twenty bloody blocks, he&#8217;ld yield them up,<br>
Before his sister should her body stoop<br>
To such abhorr&#8217;d pollution.<br>
Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:<br>
More than our brother is our chastity.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell him yet of Angelo&#8217;s request,<br>
And fit his mind to death, for his soul&#8217;s rest.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Vincentio

<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">The miserable have no other medicine<br>
But only hope:<br>
I&#8217;ve hope to live, and am prepared to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Be absolute for death; either death or life<br>
Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:<br>
If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing<br>
That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,<br>
Servile to all the skyey influences,<br>
That dost this habitation, where thou keep&#8217;st,<br>
Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death&#8217;s fool;<br>
For him thou labour&#8217;st by thy flight to shun<br>
And yet runn&#8217;st toward him still. Thou art not noble;<br>
For all the accommodations that thou bear&#8217;st<br>
Are nursed by baseness. Thou&#8217;rt by no means valiant;<br>
For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork<br>
Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,<br>
And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear&#8217;st<br>
Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;<br>
For thou exist&#8217;st on many a thousand grains<br>
That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;<br>
For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,<br>
And what thou hast, forget&#8217;st. Thou art not certain;<br>
For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,<br>
After the moon. If thou art rich, thou&#8217;rt poor;<br>
For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,<br>
Thou bear&#8217;s thy heavy riches but a journey,<br>
And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;<br>
For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,<br>
The mere effusion of thy proper loins,<br>
Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,<br>
For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,<br>
But, as it were, an after-dinner&#8217;s sleep,<br>
Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth<br>
Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms<br>
Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,<br>
Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,<br>
To make thy riches pleasant. What&#8217;s yet in this<br>
That bears the name of life? Yet in this life<br>
Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,<br>
That makes these odds all even.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>

As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.<br>
Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,<br>
Intends you for his swift ambassador,<br>
Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:<br>
Therefore your best appointment make with speed;<br>
To-morrow you set on.</p>

<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">But is there any?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, brother, you may live:<br>
There is a devilish mercy in the judge,<br>
If you&#8217;ll implore it, that will free your life,<br>
But fetter you till death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Perpetual durance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,<br>
Though all the world&#8217;s vastidity you had,<br>
To a determined scope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">But in what nature?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">In such a one as, you consenting to&#8217;t,<br>
Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,<br>
And leave you naked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Let me know the point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,<br>
Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,<br>
And six or seven winters more respect<br>
Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?<br>
The sense of death is most in apprehension;<br>
And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,<br>
In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great<br>
As when a giant dies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Why give you me this shame?<br>
Think you I can a resolution fetch<br>
From flowery tenderness? If I must die,<br>
I will encounter darkness as a bride,<br>
And hug it in mine arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">There spake my brother; there my father&#8217;s
grave<br>
Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:<br>
Thou art too noble to conserve a life<br>
In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,<br>
Whose settled visage and deliberate word<br>
Nips youth i&#8217; the head and follies doth emmew<br>
As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil<br>
His filth within being cast, he would appear<br>
A pond as deep as hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">The prenzie Angelo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;tis the cunning livery of hell,<br>
The damned&#8217;st body to invest and cover<br>
In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?<br>
If I would yield him my virginity,<br>
Thou mightst be freed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O heavens! it cannot be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, he would give&#8217;t thee, from this rank
offence,<br>
So to offend him still. This night&#8217;s the time<br>
That I should do what I abhor to name,<br>
Or else thou diest to-morrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt not do&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O, were it but my life,<br>
I&#8217;ld throw it down for your deliverance<br>
As frankly as a pin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, dear Isabel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes. Has he affections in him,<br>
That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,<br>
When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,<br>
Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Which is the least?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">If it were damnable, he being so wise,<br>
Why would he for the momentary trick<br>
Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">What says my brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Death is a fearful thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">And shamed life a hateful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;<br>
To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;<br>
This sensible warm motion to become<br>
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit<br>
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside<br>
In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;<br>
To be imprison&#8217;d in the viewless winds,<br>
And blown with restless violence round about<br>
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst<br>
Of those that lawless and incertain thought<br>
Imagine howling: &#8217;tis too horrible!<br>
The weariest and most loathed worldly life<br>
That age, ache, penury and imprisonment<br>
Can lay on nature is a paradise<br>

That it becomes a virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">O you beast!<br>
O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!<br>
Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?<br>
Is&#8217;t not a kind of incest, to take life<br>
From thine own sister&#8217;s shame? What should I think?<br>
Heaven shield my mother play&#8217;d my father fair!<br>
For such a warped slip of wilderness<br>
Ne&#8217;er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!<br>
Die, perish! Might but my bending down<br>
Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:<br>

No word to save thee.</p>

<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Son, I have overheard what hath passed between
you
and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
your knees and make ready.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of
love
with life that I will sue to be rid of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Hold you there: farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Claudio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Provost, a word with you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Provost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your will, father</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave
me
awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
habit no loss shall touch her by my company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">In good time.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Provost. Isabella comes
forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">The hand that hath made you fair hath made you
good:
the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
substitute, and to save your brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I am now going to resolve him: I had rather
my
brother die by the law than my son should be
unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
discover his government.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the
matter
now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
person; and much please the absent duke, if
peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
this business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to
do
anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful.
Have
you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard of the lady, and good words went
with her name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">She should this Angelo have married; was
affianced
to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
which time of the contract and limit of the
solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Left her in her tears, and dried not one of
them
with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
is washed with them, but relents not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">What a merit were it in death to take this poor
maid
from the world! What corruption in this life, that
it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and
the
cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
you from dishonour in doing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Show me how, good father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">This forenamed maid hath yet in her the
continuance
of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
like an impediment in the current, made it more
violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
This being granted in course,&#8212;and now follows
all,&#8212;we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
What think you of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">The image of it gives me content already; and
I
trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">It lies much in your holding up. Haste you
speedily
to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
presently to Saint Luke&#8217;s: there, at the moated
grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
it may be quickly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good
father.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas never merry world since, of two

<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>

this man made you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir,
we
take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
sent to the deputy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!<br>
The evil that thou causest to be done,<br>
That is thy means to live. Do thou but think<br>
What &#8217;tis to cram a maw or clothe a back<br>
From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,<br>
From their abominable and beastly touches<br>
I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.<br>
Canst thou believe thy living is a life,<br>
So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</p>

yet,
sir, I would prove&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for
sin,<br>
Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:<br>
Correction and instruction must both work<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
none of Pygmalion&#8217;s images, newly made woman, to be
had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
extracting it clutch&#8217;d? What reply, ha? What
sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is&#8217;t
not drowned i&#8217; the last rain, ha? What sayest
thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
trick of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Still thus, and thus; still worse!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures
she
still, ha?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and
she
is herself in the tub.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis good; it is the right of it; it
must be
so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
to prison, Pompey?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8217;tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go,
say I
sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Elbow</p>
<p class="speech">For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be
the
due of a bawd, why, &#8217;tis his right: bawd is he
doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
will keep the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">I hope, sir, your good worship will be my
bail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the
wear.
I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. &#8217;Bless you, friar.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Elbow, Pompey and
Officers</span></p>
<p class="speech">What news, friar, of the duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I know none. Can you tell me of any?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia;
other
some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him
well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal
from
the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
puts transgression to &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">He does well in &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm
in
him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">It is too general a vice, and severity must cure
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great
kindred;
it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
woman after this downright way of creation: is it
true, think you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">How should he be made, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that
he
was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
certain that when he makes water his urine is
congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
motion generative; that&#8217;s infallible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for
the
rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I never heard the absent duke much detected
for
women; he was not inclined that way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, you are deceived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not possible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty;
and
his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
that let me inform you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">You do him wrong, surely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was
the
duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
withdrawing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">What, I prithee, might be the cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">No, pardon; &#8217;tis a secret must be locked
within the
teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
understand, the greater file of the subject held the
duke to be wise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Wise! why, no question but he was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing
fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Either this is the envy in you, folly, or
mistaking:
the very stream of his life and the business he hath
helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I know him, and I love him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge
with
dearer love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, I know what I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I can hardly believe that, since you know not
what
you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
upon you; and, I pray you, your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the
duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">He shall know you better, sir, if I may live
to
report you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I fear you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">O, you hope the duke will return no more; or
you
imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
can do you little harm; you&#8217;ll forswear this again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be hanged first: thou art deceived in
me,
friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
Claudio die to-morrow or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Why should he die, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I
would
the duke we talk of were returned again: the
ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
continency; sparrows must not build in his
house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
never bring them to light: would he were returned!
Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
Fridays. He&#8217;s not past it yet, and I say to thee,
he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mistress Overdone</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, this is one Lucio&#8217;s information
against me.
Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
duke&#8217;s time; he promised her marriage: his child
is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>

Overdone</span></p>
<p class="speech">Provost, my brother Angelo will not be
altered;
Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished

if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
so with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">So please you, this friar hath been with him,

<p class="speech">Bliss and goodness on you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Of whence are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Not of this country, though my chance is now<br>
To use it for my time: I am a brother<br>
Of gracious order, late come from the See<br>
In special business from his holiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">What news abroad i&#8217; the world?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">None, but that there is so great a fever on
goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
news is old enough, yet it is every day&#8217;s news. I
pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">One that, above all other strifes, contended
especially to know himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">What pleasure was he given to?</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry
at
any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
prepared. I am made to understand that you have
lent him visitation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">He professes to have received no sinister
measure
from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
resolved to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">You have paid the heavens your function, and
the
prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
he is indeed Justice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">If his own life answer the straitness of his
proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Vincentio
disguised as before</span></p>
<p class="speech">I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish<br>
You had not found me here so musical:<br>
Let me excuse me, and believe me so,<br>
My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis good; though music oft hath such a
charm
To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
for me here to-day? much upon this time have
I promised here to meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">You have not been inquired after:<br>
I have sat here all day.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Isabella</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I do constantly believe you. The time is come
even
now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may

<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">I am always bound to you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Very well met, and well come.<br>
What is the news from this good deputy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">He hath a garden circummured with brick,<br>
Whose western side is with a vineyard back&#8217;d;<br>
And to that vineyard is a planched gate,<br>
That makes his opening with this bigger key:<br>
This other doth command a little door<br>
Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;<br>
There have I made my promise<br>
Upon the heavy middle of the night<br>
To call upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">But shall you on your knowledge find this
way?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I have ta&#8217;en a due and wary note
upon&#8217;t:<br>
With whispering and most guilty diligence,<br>
In action all of precept, he did show me<br>
The way twice o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Are there no other tokens<br>
Between you &#8217;greed concerning her observance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">No, none, but only a repair i&#8217; the
dark;<br>
And that I have possess&#8217;d him my most stay<br>
Can be but brief; for I have made him know<br>
I have a servant comes with me along,<br>
That stays upon me, whose persuasion is<br>
I come about my brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well borne up.<br>
I have not yet made known to Mariana<br>
A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Mariana</span></p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;<br>
She comes to do you good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">I do desire the like.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Take, then, this your companion by the hand,<br>
Who hath a story ready for your ear.<br>
I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;<br>
The vaporous night approaches.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please you walk aside?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mariana and
Isabella</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">O place and greatness! millions of false eyes<br>
Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report<br>
Run with these false and most contrarious quests<br>
Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit<br>
Make thee the father of their idle dreams<br>
And rack thee in their fancies.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Mariana and
Isabella</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, how agreed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;ll take the enterprise upon her,
father,<br>
If you advise it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;It is not my consent,<br>
But my entreaty too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">Little have you to say<br>
When you depart from him, but, soft and low,<br>
&#8216;Remember now my brother.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Fear me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.<br>
He is your husband on a pre-contract:<br>
To bring you thus together, &#8217;tis no sin,<br>
Sith that the justice of your title to him<br>
Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:<br>
Our corn&#8217;s to reap, for yet our tithe&#8217;s to sow.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A room in the prison.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Provost and
Pompey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a
man&#8217;s head?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he
be a
married man, he&#8217;s his wife&#8217;s head, and I can never
cut off a woman&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me
a
direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
notorious bawd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of
mind;
but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
would be glad to receive some instruction from my
fellow partner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">What, ho! Abhorson! Where&#8217;s Abhorson,
there?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Abhorson</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">Do you call, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, here&#8217;s a fellow will help you
to-morrow in
your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our
mystery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will
turn
the scale.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, sir, by your good favour,&#8212;for surely,
sir, a
good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
look,&#8212;do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; a mystery</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery;
and
your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
should be hanged, I cannot imagine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is a mystery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Proof?</p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">Every true man&#8217;s apparel fits your thief:
if it be
too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
thief thinks it little enough: so every true man&#8217;s
apparel fits your thief.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Provost</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Are you agreed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman
is
a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
oftener ask forgiveness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
to-morrow four o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abhorson</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade;
follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pompey</p>

have
occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
a good turn.</p>

<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>

<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">It is a bitter deputy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, not so; his life is parallel&#8217;d<br>
Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:<br>
He doth with holy abstinence subdue<br>
That in himself which he spurs on his power<br>
To qualify in others: were he meal&#8217;d with that<br>
Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;<br>
But this being so, he&#8217;s just.</p>

You shall hear more ere morning.</p>

You something know; yet I believe there comes<br>
No countermand; no such example have we:<br>
Besides, upon the very siege of justice<br>
Lord Angelo hath to the public ear<br>

My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
further charge, that you swerve not from the
smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
it is almost day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>

For which the pardoner himself is in.<br>
Hence hath offence his quick celerity,<br>
When it is born in high authority:<br>
When vice makes mercy, mercy&#8217;s so extended,<br>
That for the fault&#8217;s love is the offender friended.<br>
Now, sir, what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me
remiss
in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, let&#8217;s hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
let me have Claudio&#8217;s head sent me by five. Let
this be duly performed; with a thought that more
depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
not to do your office, as you will answer it at your
peril.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">
What say you to this, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in
the
afternoon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred;
one
that is a prisoner nine years old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">How came it that the absent duke had not
either
delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
have heard it was ever his manner to do so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">His friends still wrought reprieves for him:
and,
indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">It is now apparent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Most manifest, and not denied by himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he born himself penitently in prison?
how
seems he to be touched?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully
but
as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
of what&#8217;s past, present, or to come; insensible of
mortality, and desperately mortal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">He wants advice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">He will hear none: he hath evermore had the
liberty
of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">More of him anon. There is written in your
brow,
provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
manifested effect, I crave but four days&#8217; respite;
for the which you are to do me both a present and a
dangerous courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, sir, in what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">In the delaying death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">A lack, how may I do it, having the hour
limited,
and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
as Claudio&#8217;s, to cross this in the smallest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the
favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">O, death&#8217;s a great disguiser; and you may
add to it.
Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
death: you know the course is common. If any thing
fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
against it with my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, good father; it is against my
oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">To him, and to his substitutes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">You will think you have made no offence, if the
duke
avouch the justice of your dealing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">But what likelihood is in that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I
see
you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
signet is not strange to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">I know them both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">The contents of this is the return of the duke:
you
shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
shall find, within these two days he will be here.
This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
very day receives letters of strange tenor;
perchance of the duke&#8217;s death; perchance entering
into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
things should be: all difficulties are but easy
when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
with Barnardine&#8217;s head: I will give him a present
shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
Come away; it is almost clear dawn.</p>

There died this morning of a cruel fever<br>
One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,<br>
A man of Claudio&#8217;s years; his beard and head<br>
Just of his colour. What if we do omit<br>
This reprobate till he were well inclined;<br>
And satisfy the deputy with the visage<br>
Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>

Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on<br>

If he were known alive?</p>

One of our convent, and his confessor,<br>

<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to
see
thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
me to &#8217;t. But they say the duke will be here
to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:

I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.</p>

<p class="speech">You have told me too many of him already, sir,
if
they be true; if not true, none were enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I was once before him for getting a wench with
child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Did you such a thing?</p>

<p class="speech">O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest<br>
There is another comfort than this world,<br>
That thou neglect me not, with that opinion<br>
That I am touch&#8217;d with madness! Make not impossible<br>
That which but seems unlike: &#8217;tis not impossible<br>
But one, the wicked&#8217;st caitiff on the ground,<br>
May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute<br>
As Angelo; even so may Angelo,<br>
In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,<br>

<p class="speech">O gracious duke,<br>
Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason<br>

To make the truth appear where it seems hid,<br>
And hide the false seems true.</p>

<p class="speech">Mended again. The matter; proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">In brief, to set the needless process by,<br>
How I persuaded, how I pray&#8217;d, and kneel&#8217;d,<br>
How he refell&#8217;d me, and how I replied,&#8212;<br>
For this was of much length,&#8212;the vile conclusion<br>
I now begin with grief and shame to utter:<br>
He would not, but by gift of my chaste body<br>
To his concupiscible intemperate lust,<br>
Release my brother; and, after much debatement,<br>
My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,<br>
And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,<br>
His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant<br>
For my poor brother&#8217;s head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>

<p class="speech">By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what
thou speak&#8217;st,<br>
Or else thou art suborn&#8217;d against his honour<br>
In hateful practise. First, his integrity<br>
Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason<br>
That with such vehemency he should pursue<br>
Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,<br>
He would have weigh&#8217;d thy brother by himself<br>
And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:<br>
Confess the truth, and say by whose advice<br>
Thou camest here to complain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Isabella</p>
<p class="speech">And is this all?<br>
Then, O you blessed ministers above,<br>
Keep me in patience, and with ripen&#8217;d time<br>
Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up<br>
In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,<br>
As I, thus wrong&#8217;d, hence unbelieved go!</p>

A very scurvy fellow.</p>

<p class="speech">I know him for a man divine and holy;<br>
Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,<br>
As he&#8217;s reported by this gentleman;<br>
And, on my trust, a man that never yet<br>
Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, most villanously; believe it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Well, he in time may come to clear himself;<br>
But at this instant he is sick my lord,<br>
Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,<br>
Being come to knowledge that there was complaint<br>
Intended &#8217;gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,<br>
To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know<br>
Is true and false; and what he with his oath<br>
And all probation will make up full clear,<br>
Whensoever he&#8217;s convented. First, for this woman.<br>
To justify this worthy nobleman,<br>
So vulgarly and personally accused,<br>
Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,<br>
Till she herself confess it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Good friar, let&#8217;s hear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Isabella is carried off
guarded; and Mariana comes forward</span></p>
<p class="speech">Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?<br>
O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!<br>
Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;<br>
In this I&#8217;ll be impartial; be you judge<br>
Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?<br>
First, let her show her face, and after speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face<br>
Until my husband bid me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">What, are you married?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Are you a maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">A widow, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Neither, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow,
nor wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them
are
neither maid, widow, nor wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Silence that fellow: I would he had some
cause<br>
To prattle for himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">My lord; I do confess I ne&#8217;er was
married;<br>
And I confess besides I am no maid:<br>
I have known my husband; yet my husband<br>
Knows not that ever he knew me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no
better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so
too!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">This is no witness for Lord Angelo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Now I come to&#8217;t my lord<br>
She that accuses him of fornication,<br>
In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,<br>
And charges him my lord, with such a time<br>
When I&#8217;ll depose I had him in mine arms<br>
With all the effect of love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Charges she more than me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Not that I know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">No? you say your husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,<br>
Who thinks he knows that he ne&#8217;er knew my body,<br>
But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">This is a strange abuse. Let&#8217;s see thy
face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">My husband bids me; now I will unmask.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Unveiling</span></p>
<p class="speech">This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,<br>
Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;<br>
This is the hand which, with a vow&#8217;d contract,<br>
Was fast belock&#8217;d in thine; this is the body<br>
That took away the match from Isabel,<br>
And did supply thee at thy garden-house<br>
In her imagined person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Know you this woman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Carnally, she says.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, no more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I must confess I know this woman:<br>
And five years since there was some speech of marriage<br>
Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,<br>
Partly for that her promised proportions<br>
Came short of composition, but in chief<br>
For that her reputation was disvalued<br>
In levity: since which time of five years<br>
I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,<br>
Upon my faith and honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mariana</p>
<p class="speech">Noble prince,<br>
As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,<br>
As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,<br>
I am affianced this man&#8217;s wife as strongly<br>
As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,<br>
But Tuesday night last gone in&#8217;s garden-house<br>
He knew me as a wife. As this is true,<br>
Let me in safety raise me from my knees<br>
Or else for ever be confixed here,<br>
A marble monument!</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;I did but smile till now:<br>
Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice<br>
My patience here is touch&#8217;d. I do perceive<br>
These poor informal women are no more<br>
But instruments of some more mightier member<br>
That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,<br>
To find this practise out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, with my heart<br>
And punish them to your height of pleasure.<br>
Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,<br>
Compact with her that&#8217;s gone, think&#8217;st thou thy
oaths,<br>
Though they would swear down each particular saint,<br>
Were testimonies against his worth and credit<br>
That&#8217;s seal&#8217;d in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,<br>
Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains<br>
To find out this abuse, whence &#8217;tis derived.<br>
There is another friar that set them on;<br>
Let him be sent for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed<br>
Hath set the women on to this complaint:<br>
Your provost knows the place where he abides<br>
And he may fetch him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Go do it instantly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Provost</span></p>
<p class="speech">And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,<br>
Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,<br>
Do with your injuries as seems you best,<br>
In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;<br>
But stir not you till you have well determined<br>
Upon these slanderers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we&#8217;ll do it throughly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Duke</span></p>
<p class="speech">Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that<br>
Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Cucullus non facit monachum:&#8217; honest
in nothing
but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
villanous speeches of the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">We shall entreat you to abide here till he come
and
enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
notable fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">As any in Vienna, on my word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Call that same Isabel here once again; I would
speak with her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question;
you
shall see how I&#8217;ll handle her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Not better than he, by her own report.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her
privately,
she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
she&#8217;ll be ashamed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">I will go darkly to work with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s the way; for women are light at
midnight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Officers with
Isabella; and Provost with the Duke Vincentio in his friar&#8217;s
habit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, mistress: here&#8217;s a gentlewoman
denies all
that you have said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here
with
the provost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">In very good time: speak not you to him till
we
call upon you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Mum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir: did you set these women on to
slander<br>
Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">How! know you where you are?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Respect to your great place! and let the
devil<br>
Be sometime honour&#8217;d for his burning throne!<br>
Where is the duke? &#8217;tis he should hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">The duke&#8217;s in us; and we will hear you
speak:<br>
Look you speak justly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,<br>
Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?<br>
Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?<br>
Then is your cause gone too. The duke&#8217;s unjust,<br>
Thus to retort your manifest appeal,<br>
And put your trial in the villain&#8217;s mouth<br>
Which here you come to accuse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou unreverend and unhallow&#8217;d
friar,<br>
Is&#8217;t not enough thou hast suborn&#8217;d these women<br>
To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth<br>
And in the witness of his proper ear,<br>
To call him villain? and then to glance from him<br>
To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?<br>
Take him hence; to the rack with him! We&#8217;ll touse you<br>
Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.<br>
What &#8217;unjust&#8217;!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;&#8195;Be not so hot; the duke<br>
Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he<br>
Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,<br>
Nor here provincial. My business in this state<br>
Made me a looker on here in Vienna,<br>
Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble<br>
Till it o&#8217;er-run the stew; laws for all faults,<br>
But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes<br>
Stand like the forfeits in a barber&#8217;s shop,<br>
As much in mock as mark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Slander to the state! Away with him to
prison!</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">What can you vouch against him, Signior
Lucio?<br>
Is this the man that you did tell us of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman
baldpate:
do you know me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice:
I
met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">O, did you so? And do you remember what you said
of the duke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Most notedly, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger,
a
fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you
make
that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
much more, much worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by
the
nose for thy speeches?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">I protest I love the duke as I love myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, how the villain would close now, after
his
treasonable abuses!</p>
<p class="speaker">Escalus</p>
<p class="speech">Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away
with
him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
with the other confederate companion!</p>

you
bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
you? Show your knave&#8217;s visage, with a pox to you!
show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!

And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.<br>
Your brother&#8217;s death, I know, sits at your heart;<br>
And you may marvel why I obscured myself,<br>
Labouring to save his life, and would not rather<br>
Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power<br>
Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,<br>
It was the swift celerity of his death,<br>
Which I did think with slower foot came on,<br>
That brain&#8217;d my purpose. But, peace be with him!<br>
That life is better life, past fearing death,<br>

Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;<br>
Like doth quit like, and Measure still For Measure.<br>
Then, Angelo, thy fault&#8217;s thus manifested;<br>

That apprehends no further than this world,<br>
And squarest thy life according. Thou&#8217;rt condemn&#8217;d:<br>
But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;<br>
And pray thee take this mercy to provide<br>
For better times to come. Friar, advise him;<br>
I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Provost</p>
<p class="speech">This is another prisoner that I saved.<br>
Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;<br>
As like almost to Claudio as himself.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Unmuffles Claudio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Isabella]</span> If he be
like your brother, for his sake<br>
Is he pardon&#8217;d; and, for your lovely sake,<br>
Give me your hand and say you will be mine.<br>
He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.<br>
By this Lord Angelo perceives he&#8217;s safe;<br>
Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.<br>
Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:<br>
Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.<br>
I find an apt remission in myself;<br>
And yet here&#8217;s one in place I cannot pardon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lucio</span></p>
<p class="speech">You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a
coward,<br>
One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;<br>
Wherein have I so deserved of you,<br>
That you extol me thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according
to the
trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
had rather it would please you I might be whipt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.<br>
Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.<br>
Is any woman wrong&#8217;d by this lewd fellow,<br>
As I have heard him swear himself there&#8217;s one<br>
Whom he begot with child, let her appear,<br>
And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish&#8217;d,<br>
Let him be whipt and hang&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a
whore.
Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.<br>
Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal<br>
Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;<br>
And see our pleasure herein executed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucio</p>
<p class="speech">Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to
death,
whipping, and hanging.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Slandering a prince deserves it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Officers with
Lucio</span></p>
<p class="speech">She, Claudio, that you wrong&#8217;d, look you
restore.<br>
Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:<br>
I have confess&#8217;d her and I know her virtue.<br>
Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:<br>
There&#8217;s more behind that is more gratulate.<br>
Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:<br>
We shill employ thee in a worthier place.<br>
Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home<br>
The head of Ragozine for Claudio&#8217;s:<br>
The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,<br>
I have a motion much imports your good;<br>
Whereto if you&#8217;ll a willing ear incline,<br>
What&#8217;s mine is yours and what is yours is mine.<br>
So, bring us to our palace; where we&#8217;ll show<br>
What&#8217;s yet behind, that&#8217;s meet you all should know.</p>
