<h4>Scene I. Britain. The Roman camp.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Posthumus, with a
bloody handkerchief</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, bloody cloth, I&#8217;ll keep thee, for I
wish&#8217;d<br>
Thou shouldst be colour&#8217;d thus. You married ones,<br>
If each of you should take this course, how many<br>
Must murder wives much better than themselves<br>
For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!<br>
Every good servant does not all commands:<br>
No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you<br>
Should have ta&#8217;en vengeance on my faults, I never<br>
Had lived to put on this: so had you saved<br>
The noble Imogen to repent, and struck<br>
Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,<br>
You snatch some hence for little faults; that&#8217;s love,<br>
To have them fall no more: you some permit<br>
To second ills with ills, each elder worse,<br>
And make them dread it, to the doers&#8217; thrift.<br>
But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,<br>
And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither<br>
Among the Italian gentry, and to fight<br>
Against my lady&#8217;s kingdom: &#8217;tis enough<br>
That, Britain, I have kill&#8217;d thy mistress; peace!<br>
I&#8217;ll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,<br>
Hear patiently my purpose: I&#8217;ll disrobe me<br>
Of these Italian weeds and suit myself<br>
As does a Briton peasant: so I&#8217;ll fight<br>
Against the part I come with; so I&#8217;ll die<br>
For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life<br>
Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,<br>
Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril<br>
Myself I&#8217;ll dedicate. Let me make men know<br>
More valour in me than my habits show.<br>
Gods, put the strength o&#8217; the Leonati in me!<br>
To shame the guise o&#8217; the world, I will begin<br>
The fashion, less without and more within.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Field of battle between the British and Roman
camps.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, from one side, Lucius,
Iachimo, and the Roman Army: from the other side, the British Army;
Posthumus Leonatus following, like a poor soldier. They march over
and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, Iachimo and Posthumus
Leonatus he vanquisheth and disarmeth Iachimo, and then leaves
him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">The heaviness and guilt within my bosom<br>
Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,<br>
The princess of this country, and the air on&#8217;t<br>
Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,<br>
A very drudge of nature&#8217;s, have subdued me<br>
In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne<br>
As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.<br>
If that thy gentry, Britain, go before<br>
This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds<br>
Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The battle continues; the
Britons fly; Cymbeline is taken: then enter, to his rescue,
Belarius, Guiderius, and Arviragus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the
ground;<br>
The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but<br>
The villany of our fears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, stand, and fight!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Posthumus Leonatus,
and seconds the Britons: they rescue Cymbeline, and exeunt. Then
re-enter Lucius, and Iachimo, with Imogen</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;<br>
For friends kill friends, and the disorder&#8217;s such<br>
As war were hoodwink&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis their fresh supplies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">It is a day turn&#8217;d strangely: or
betimes<br>
Let&#8217;s reinforce, or fly.</p>

<h4>Scene III. Another part of the field.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Posthumus Leonatus and
a British Lord</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Camest thou from where they made the stand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I did.<br>
Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,<br>
But that the heavens fought: the king himself<br>
Of his wings destitute, the army broken,<br>
And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying<br>
Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,<br>
Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work<br>
More plentiful than tools to do&#8217;t, struck down<br>
Some mortally, some slightly touch&#8217;d, some falling<br>
Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm&#8217;d<br>
With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living<br>
To die with lengthen&#8217;d shame.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Where was this lane?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Close by the battle, ditch&#8217;d, and
wall&#8217;d with turf;<br>
Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,<br>
An honest one, I warrant; who deserved<br>
So long a breeding as his white beard came to,<br>
In doing this for&#8217;s country: athwart the lane,<br>
He, with two striplings-lads more like to run<br>
The country base than to commit such slaughter<br>
With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer<br>
Than those for preservation cased, or shame&#8212;<br>
Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,<br>
&#8216;Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:<br>
To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;<br>
Or we are Romans and will give you that<br>
Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,<br>
But to look back in frown: stand, stand.&#8217;<br>
These three,<br>
Three thousand confident, in act as many&#8212;<br>
For three performers are the file when all<br>
The rest do nothing&#8212;with this word &#8216;stand,
stand,&#8217;<br>
Accommodated by the place, more charming<br>
With their own nobleness, which could have turn&#8217;d<br>
A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,<br>
Part shame, part spirit renew&#8217;d; that some, turn&#8217;d
coward<br>
But by example&#8212;O, a sin in war,<br>
Damn&#8217;d in the first beginners!&#8212;gan to look<br>
The way that they did, and to grin like lions<br>
Upon the pikes o&#8217; the hunters. Then began<br>
A stop i&#8217; the chaser, a retire, anon<br>
A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly<br>
Chickens, the way which they stoop&#8217;d eagles; slaves,<br>
The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,<br>
Like fragments in hard voyages, became<br>
The life o&#8217; the need: having found the backdoor open<br>
Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!<br>
Some slain before; some dying; some their friends<br>
O&#8217;er borne i&#8217; the former wave: ten, chased by one,<br>
Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:<br>
Those that would die or ere resist are grown<br>
The mortal bugs o&#8217; the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">This was strange chance<br>
A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made<br>
Rather to wonder at the things you hear<br>
Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon&#8217;t,<br>
And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:<br>
&#8216;Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,<br>
Preserved the Britons, was the Romans&#8217; bane.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, be not angry, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Lack, to what end?<br>
Who dares not stand his foe, I&#8217;ll be his friend;<br>
For if he&#8217;ll do as he is made to do,<br>
I know he&#8217;ll quickly fly my friendship too.<br>
You have put me into rhyme.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell; you&#8217;re angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Still going?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Lord</span></p>
<p class="speech">This is a lord! O noble misery,<br>
To be i&#8217; the field, and ask &#8216;what news?&#8217; of
me!<br>
To-day how many would have given their honours<br>
To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do&#8217;t,<br>
And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm&#8217;d,<br>
Could not find death where I did hear him groan,<br>
Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,<br>
&#8217;Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,<br>
Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we<br>
That draw his knives i&#8217; the war. Well, I will find him<br>
For being now a favourer to the Briton,<br>
No more a Briton, I have resumed again<br>
The part I came in: fight I will no more,<br>
But yield me to the veriest hind that shall<br>
Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is<br>
Here made by the Roman; great the answer be<br>
Britons must take. For me, my ransom&#8217;s death;<br>
On either side I come to spend my breath;<br>
Which neither here I&#8217;ll keep nor bear again,<br>
But end it by some means for Imogen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two British Captains
and Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.<br>
&#8217;Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Captain</p>
<p class="speech">There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,<br>
That gave the affront with them.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Captain</p>
<p class="speech">So &#8217;tis reported:<br>
But none of &#8217;em can be found. Stand! who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">A Roman,<br>
Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds<br>
Had answer&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Captain</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Lay hands on him; a dog!<br>
A leg of Rome shall not return to tell<br>
What crows have peck&#8217;d them here. He brags his service<br>
As if he were of note: bring him to the king.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cymbeline, Belarius,
Guiderius, Arviragus, Pisanio, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman
Captives. The Captains present Posthumus Leonatus to Cymbeline, who
delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes</span></p>

<h4>Scene IV. A British prison.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Posthumus Leonatus and
two Gaolers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not now be stol&#8217;n, you have locks
upon you;<br>
So graze as you find pasture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or a stomach.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gaolers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,<br>
I think, to liberty: yet am I better<br>
Than one that&#8217;s sick o&#8217; the gout; since he had
rather<br>
Groan so in perpetuity than be cured<br>
By the sure physician, death, who is the key<br>
To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter&#8217;d<br>
More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me<br>
The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,<br>
Then, free for ever! Is&#8217;t enough I am sorry?<br>
So children temporal fathers do appease;<br>
Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?<br>
I cannot do it better than in gyves,<br>
Desired more than constrain&#8217;d: to satisfy,<br>
If of my freedom &#8217;tis the main part, take<br>
No stricter render of me than my all.<br>
I know you are more clement than vile men,<br>
Who of their broken debtors take a third,<br>
A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again<br>
On their abatement: that&#8217;s not my desire:<br>
For Imogen&#8217;s dear life take mine; and though<br>
&#8217;Tis not so dear, yet &#8217;tis a life; you coin&#8217;d
it:<br>
&#8217;Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;<br>
Though light, take pieces for the figure&#8217;s sake:<br>
You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,<br>
If you will take this audit, take this life,<br>
And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!<br>
I&#8217;ll speak to thee in silence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Solemn music. Enter, as in an
apparition, Sicilius Leonatus, father to Posthumus Leonatus, an old
man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron,
his wife, and mother to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:
then, after other music, follow the two young Leonati, brothers to
Posthumus Leonatus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They
circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sicilius Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">No more, thou thunder-master, show<br>
Thy spite on mortal flies:<br>
With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,<br>
That thy adulteries<br>
Rates and revenges.<br>
Hath my poor boy done aught but well,<br>
Whose face I never saw?<br>
I died whilst in the womb he stay&#8217;d<br>
Attending nature&#8217;s law:<br>
Whose father then, as men report<br>
Thou orphans&#8217; father art,<br>
Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him<br>
From this earth-vexing smart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mother</p>
<p class="speech">Lucina lent not me her aid,<br>
But took me in my throes;<br>
That from me was Posthumus ript,<br>
Came crying &#8217;mongst his foes,<br>
A thing of pity!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicilius Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Great nature, like his ancestry,<br>
Moulded the stuff so fair,<br>
That he deserved the praise o&#8217; the world,<br>
As great Sicilius&#8217; heir.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Brother</p>
<p class="speech">When once he was mature for man,<br>
In Britain where was he<br>
That could stand up his parallel;<br>
Or fruitful object be<br>
In eye of Imogen, that best<br>
Could deem his dignity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mother</p>
<p class="speech">With marriage wherefore was he mock&#8217;d,<br>
To be exiled, and thrown<br>
From Leonati seat, and cast<br>
From her his dearest one,<br>
Sweet Imogen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicilius Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Why did you suffer Iachimo,<br>
Slight thing of Italy,<br>
To taint his nobler heart and brain<br>
With needless jealosy;<br>
And to become the geck and scorn<br>

Fell bravely and were slain,<br>
Our fealty and Tenantius&#8217; right<br>
With honour to maintain.</p>

The graces for his merits due,<br>
Being all to dolours turn&#8217;d?</p>

<p class="speech">Thy crystal window ope; look out;<br>
No longer exercise<br>
Upon a valiant race thy harsh<br>
And potent injuries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mother</p>
<p class="speech">Since, Jupiter, our son is good,<br>
Take off his miseries.</p>

Or we poor ghosts will cry<br>
To the shining synod of the rest<br>
Against thy deity.</p>

Our Jovial star reign&#8217;d at his birth, and in<br>
Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.<br>
He shall be lord of lady Imogen,<br>
And happier much by his affliction made.<br>
This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein<br>
Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:<br>
And so, away: no further with your din<br>

A father to me; and thou hast created<br>

Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:<br>
And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend<br>
On greatness&#8217; favour dream as I have done,<br>
Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:<br>
Many dream not to find, neither deserve,<br>
And yet are steep&#8217;d in favours: so am I,<br>
That have this golden chance and know not why.<br>
What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!<br>

Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.&#8217;</p>

<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">Hanging is the word, sir: if
you be ready for that, you are well cooked.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">So, if I prove a good repast to the
spectators, the dish pays the shot.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort
is,
you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
light, the purse too light, being drawn of
heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
creditor but it; of what&#8217;s past, is, and to come,
the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
counters; so the acquittance follows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I am merrier to die than thou art to live.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
would change places with his officer; for, look you,
sir, you know not which way you shall go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, indeed do I, fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Gaoler</p>
<p class="speech">Your death has eyes in &#8217;s head then; I have
not seen
him so pictured: you must either be directed by
some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
you shall speed in your journey&#8217;s end, I think
you&#8217;ll
never return to tell one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes
to

<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made<br>
Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart<br>
That the poor soldier that so richly fought,<br>
Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast<br>
Stepp&#8217;d before larges of proof, cannot be found:<br>
He shall be happy that can find him, if<br>
Our grace can make him so.</p>

Such noble fury in so poor a thing;<br>

To sour your happiness, I must report<br>
The queen is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Who worse than a physician<br>
Would this report become? But I consider,<br>
By medicine life may be prolong&#8217;d, yet death<br>
Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">With horror, madly dying, like her life,<br>
Which, being cruel to the world, concluded<br>
Most cruel to herself. What she confess&#8217;d<br>
I will report, so please you: these her women<br>
Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks<br>
Were present when she finish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">First, she confess&#8217;d she never loved you,
only<br>
Affected greatness got by you, not you:<br>
Married your royalty, was wife to your place;<br>
Abhorr&#8217;d your person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">She alone knew this;<br>
And, but she spoke it dying, I would not<br>
Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love<br>
With such integrity, she did confess<br>
Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,<br>
But that her flight prevented it, she had<br>
Ta&#8217;en off by poison.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O most delicate fiend!<br>
Who is &#8217;t can read a woman? Is there more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had<br>
For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,<br>
Should by the minute feed on life and lingering<br>
By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,<br>
By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to<br>
O&#8217;ercome you with her show, and in time,<br>
When she had fitted you with her craft, to work<br>
Her son into the adoption of the crown:<br>
But, failing of her end by his strange absence,<br>
Grew shameless-desperate; open&#8217;d, in despite<br>
Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented<br>
The evils she hatch&#8217;d were not effected; so<br>
Despairing died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Heard you all this, her women?</p>

<p class="speech">We did, so please your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eyes<br>
Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;<br>
Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,<br>
That thought her like her seeming; it had been vicious<br>
To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!<br>
That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,<br>
And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius, Iachimo, the
Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; Posthumus Leonatus

<p class="speech">Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that<br>
The Britons have razed out, though with the loss<br>
Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit<br>
That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter<br>
Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:<br>
So think of your estate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day<br>
Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,<br>
We should not, when the blood was cool, have threaten&#8217;d<br>
Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods<br>
Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives<br>
May be call&#8217;d ransom, let it come: sufficeth<br>
A Roman with a Roman&#8217;s heart can suffer:<br>
Augustus lives to think on&#8217;t: and so much<br>
For my peculiar care. This one thing only<br>
I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,<br>
Let him be ransom&#8217;d: never master had<br>
A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,<br>
So tender over his occasions, true,<br>
So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join<br>
With my request, which I make bold your highness<br>
Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,<br>
Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,<br>
And spare no blood beside.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I have surely seen him:<br>
His favour is familiar to me. Boy,<br>
Thou hast look&#8217;d thyself into my grace,<br>
And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,<br>
To say &#8216;live, boy:&#8217; ne&#8217;er thank thy master;
live:<br>
And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,<br>
Fitting my bounty and thy state, I&#8217;ll give it;<br>
Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,<br>
The noblest ta&#8217;en.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>

<p class="speech">I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;<br>
And yet I know thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No, no: alack,<br>
There&#8217;s other work in hand: I see a thing<br>
Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,<br>
Must shuffle for itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">The boy disdains me,<br>
He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys<br>
That place them on the truth of girls and boys.<br>
Why stands he so perplex&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou, boy?<br>
I love thee more and more: think more and more<br>
What&#8217;s best to ask. Know&#8217;st him thou look&#8217;st on?
speak,<br>
Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">He is a Roman; no more kin to me<br>
Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,<br>
Am something nearer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore eyest him so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell you, sir, in private, if you

To give me hearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, with all my heart,<br>
And lend my best attention. What&#8217;s thy name?</p>

<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou&#8217;rt my good youth, my

<p class="speech">The same dead thing alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>

Creatures may be alike: were &#8217;t he, I am sure<br>
He would have spoke to us.</p>

<p class="speech">But we saw him dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>

<p class="speaker">Pisanio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> It is my

Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;<br>
Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,<br>
Which is our honour, bitter torture shall<br>
Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">My boon is, that this gentleman may render<br>
Of whom he had this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>

<p class="speech">Thou&#8217;lt torture me to leave unspoken

<p class="speech">How! me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad to be constrain&#8217;d to utter
that<br>
Which torments me to conceal. By villany<br>
I got this ring: &#8217;twas Leonatus&#8217; jewel;<br>
Whom thou didst banish; and&#8212;which more may grieve thee,<br>
As it doth me&#8212;a nobler sir ne&#8217;er lived<br>
&#8217;Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">All that belongs to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">That paragon, thy daughter,&#8212;<br>
For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits<br>
Quail to remember&#8212;Give me leave; I faint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:<br>
I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will<br>
Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Upon a time,&#8212;unhappy was the clock<br>
That struck the hour!&#8212;it was in Rome,&#8212;accursed<br>
The mansion where!&#8212;&#8217;twas at a feast,&#8212;O, would<br>
Our viands had been poison&#8217;d, or at least<br>
Those which I heaved to head!&#8212;the good Posthumus&#8212;<br>
What should I say? he was too good to be<br>
Where ill men were; and was the best of all<br>
Amongst the rarest of good ones,&#8212;sitting sadly,<br>
Hearing us praise our loves of Italy<br>
For beauty that made barren the swell&#8217;d boast<br>
Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming<br>
The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.<br>
Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,<br>
A shop of all the qualities that man<br>
Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,<br>
Fairness which strikes the eye&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I stand on fire:<br>
Come to the matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">All too soon I shall,<br>
Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,<br>
Most like a noble lord in love and one<br>
That had a royal lover, took his hint;<br>
And, not dispraising whom we praised,&#8212;therein<br>
He was as calm as virtue&#8212;he began<br>
His mistress&#8217; picture; which by his tongue being made,<br>
And then a mind put in&#8217;t, either our brags<br>
Were crack&#8217;d of kitchen-trolls, or his description<br>
Proved us unspeaking sots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, nay, to the purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech">Your daughter&#8217;s chastity&#8212;there it
begins.<br>
He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,<br>
And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,<br>
Made scruple of his praise; and wager&#8217;d with him<br>
Pieces of gold &#8217;gainst this which then he wore<br>
Upon his honour&#8217;d finger, to attain<br>
In suit the place of&#8217;s bed and win this ring<br>
By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,<br>
No lesser of her honour confident<br>
Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;<br>
And would so, had it been a carbuncle<br>
Of Phoebus&#8217; wheel, and might so safely, had it<br>
Been all the worth of&#8217;s car. Away to Britain<br>
Post I in this design: well may you, sir,<br>
Remember me at court; where I was taught<br>
Of your chaste daughter the wide difference<br>
&#8217;Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench&#8217;d<br>
Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain<br>
&#8217;Gan in your duller Britain operate<br>
Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:<br>
And, to be brief, my practise so prevail&#8217;d,<br>
That I return&#8217;d with simular proof enough<br>
To make the noble Leonatus mad,<br>
By wounding his belief in her renown<br>
With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes<br>
Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,&#8212;<br>
O cunning, how I got it!&#8212;nay, some marks<br>
Of secret on her person, that he could not<br>
But think her bond of chastity quite crack&#8217;d,<br>
I having ta&#8217;en the forfeit. Whereupon&#8212;<br>
Methinks, I see him now&#8212;</p>

With language that would make me spurn the sea,<br>
If it could so roar to me: I cut off&#8217;s head;<br>
And am right glad he is not standing here<br>
To tell this tale of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry for thee:<br>
By thine own tongue thou art condemn&#8217;d, and must<br>
Endure our law: thou&#8217;rt dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">That headless man<br>
I thought had been my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Bind the offender,<br>
And take him from our presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, sir king:<br>
This man is better than the man he slew,<br>
As well descended as thyself; and hath<br>
More of thee merited than a band of Clotens<br>
Had ever scar for.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To the Guard</span></p>
<p class="speech">Let his arms alone;<br>
They were not born for bondage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Why, old soldier,<br>
Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,<br>
By tasting of our wrath? How of descent<br>
As good as we?</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In that he spake too far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">And thou shalt die for&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">We will die all three:<br>
But I will prove that two on&#8217;s are as good<br>
As I have given out him. My sons, I must,<br>
For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,<br>
Though, haply, well for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">Your danger&#8217;s ours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speech">And our good his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Have at it then, by leave.<br>
Thou hadst, great king, a subject who<br>
Was call&#8217;d Belarius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">What of him? he is<br>
A banish&#8217;d traitor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">He it is that hath<br>
Assumed this age; indeed a banish&#8217;d man;<br>
I know not how a traitor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Take him hence:<br>
The whole world shall not save him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Not too hot:<br>
First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;<br>
And let it be confiscate all, so soon<br>
As I have received it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nursing of my sons!</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">I am too blunt and saucy: here&#8217;s my
knee:<br>
Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;<br>
Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,<br>
These two young gentlemen, that call me father<br>
And think they are my sons, are none of mine;<br>
They are the issue of your loins, my liege,<br>
And blood of your begetting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">How! my issue!</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">So sure as you your father&#8217;s. I, old
Morgan,<br>
Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish&#8217;d:<br>
Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment<br>
Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer&#8217;d<br>
Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes&#8212;<br>
For such and so they are&#8212;these twenty years<br>
Have I train&#8217;d up: those arts they have as I<br>
Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as<br>
Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,<br>
Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children<br>
Upon my banishment: I moved her to&#8217;t,<br>
Having received the punishment before,<br>
For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty<br>
Excited me to treason: their dear loss,<br>
The more of you &#8217;twas felt, the more it shaped<br>
Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,<br>
Here are your sons again; and I must lose<br>
Two of the sweet&#8217;st companions in the world.<br>
The benediction of these covering heavens<br>
Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy<br>
To inlay heaven with stars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Thou weep&#8217;st, and speak&#8217;st.<br>
The service that you three have done is more<br>
Unlike than this thou tell&#8217;st. I lost my children:<br>
If these be they, I know not how to wish<br>
A pair of worthier sons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">Be pleased awhile.<br>
This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,<br>
Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:<br>
This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,<br>
Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp&#8217;d<br>
In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand<br>
Of his queen mother, which for more probation<br>
I can with ease produce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Guiderius had<br>
Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;<br>
It was a mark of wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Belarius</p>
<p class="speech">This is he;<br>
Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:<br>
It was wise nature&#8217;s end in the donation,<br>
To be his evidence now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O, what, am I<br>
A mother to the birth of three? Ne&#8217;er mother<br>
Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,<br>
That, after this strange starting from your orbs,<br>
May reign in them now! O Imogen,<br>
Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord;<br>
I have got two worlds by &#8217;t. O my gentle brothers,<br>
Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter<br>
But I am truest speaker you call&#8217;d me brother,<br>
When I was but your sister; I you brothers,<br>
When ye were so indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Did you e&#8217;er meet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Guiderius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And at first meeting loved;<br>
Continued so, until we thought he died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornelius</p>
<p class="speech">By the queen&#8217;s dram she
swallow&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">O rare instinct!<br>
When shall I hear all through? This fierce abridgement<br>
Hath to it circumstantial branches, which<br>
Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?<br>
And when came you to serve our Roman captive?<br>
How parted with your brothers? how first met them?<br>
Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,<br>
And your three motives to the battle, with<br>
I know not how much more, should be demanded;<br>
And all the other by-dependencies,<br>
From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place<br>
Will serve our long inter&#8217;gatories. See,<br>
Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,<br>
And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye<br>
On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting<br>
Each object with a joy: the counterchange<br>
Is severally in all. Let&#8217;s quit this ground,<br>
And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Belarius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou art my brother; so we&#8217;ll hold thee
ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">You are my father too, and did relieve me,<br>
To see this gracious season.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">All o&#8217;erjoy&#8217;d,<br>
Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,<br>
For they shall taste our comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Imogen</p>
<p class="speech">My good master,<br>
I will yet do you service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Happy be you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,<br>
He would have well becomed this place, and graced<br>
The thankings of a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">I am, sir,<br>
The soldier that did company these three<br>
In poor beseeming; &#8217;twas a fitment for<br>
The purpose I then follow&#8217;d. That I was he,<br>
Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might<br>
Have made you finish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iachimo</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> I am down
again:<br>
But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,<br>
As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,<br>
Which I so often owe: but your ring first;<br>
And here the bracelet of the truest princess<br>
That ever swore her faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Kneel not to me:<br>
The power that I have on you is, to spare you;<br>
The malice towards you to forgive you: live,<br>
And deal with others better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Nobly doom&#8217;d!<br>
We&#8217;ll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;<br>
Pardon&#8217;s the word to all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arviragus</p>
<p class="speech">You holp us, sir,<br>
As you did mean indeed to be our brother;<br>
Joy&#8217;d are we that you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Posthumus Leonatus</p>
<p class="speech">Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,<br>
Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought<br>
Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back&#8217;d,<br>
Appear&#8217;d to me, with other spritely shows<br>
Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found<br>
This label on my bosom; whose containing<br>
Is so from sense in hardness, that I can<br>
Make no collection of it: let him show<br>
His skill in the construction.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Philarmonus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Here, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caius Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Read, and declare the meaning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> &#8216;When as
a lion&#8217;s whelp shall, to himself
unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
peace and plenty.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, Leonatus, art the lion&#8217;s whelp;<br>
The fit and apt construction of thy name,<br>
Being Leonatus, doth import so much.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Cymbeline</span></p>
<p class="speech">The piece of tender air, thy virtuous
daughter,<br>
Which we call &#8216;mollis aer;&#8217; and &#8216;mollis
aer&#8217;<br>
We term it &#8216;mulier:&#8217; which &#8216;mulier&#8217; I
divine<br>
Is this most constant wife; who, even now,<br>
Answering the letter of the oracle,<br>
Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp&#8217;d about<br>
With this most tender air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">This hath some seeming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,<br>
Personates thee: and thy lopp&#8217;d branches point<br>
Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol&#8217;n,<br>
For many years thought dead, are now revived,<br>
To the majestic cedar join&#8217;d, whose issue<br>
Promises Britain peace and plenty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Well<br>
My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,<br>
Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,<br>
And to the Roman empire; promising<br>
To pay our wonted tribute, from the which<br>
We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;<br>
Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,<br>
Have laid most heavy hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">The fingers of the powers above do tune<br>
The harmony of this peace. The vision<br>
Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke<br>
Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant<br>
Is full accomplish&#8217;d; for the Roman eagle,<br>
From south to west on wing soaring aloft,<br>
Lessen&#8217;d herself, and in the beams o&#8217; the sun<br>
So vanish&#8217;d: which foreshow&#8217;d our princely eagle,<br>
The imperial Caesar, should again unite<br>
His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,<br>
Which shines here in the west.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cymbeline</p>
<p class="speech">Laud we the gods;<br>
And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils<br>
From our blest altars. Publish we this peace<br>
To all our subjects. Set we forward: let<br>
A Roman and a British ensign wave<br>
Friendly together: so through Lud&#8217;s-town march:<br>
And in the temple of great Jupiter<br>
Our peace we&#8217;ll ratify; seal it with feasts.<br>
Set on there! Never was a war did cease,<br>
Ere bloody hands were wash&#8217;d, with such a peace.</p>
