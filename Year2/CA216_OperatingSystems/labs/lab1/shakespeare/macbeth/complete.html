Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding
Sergeant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">What bloody man is that? He can report,<br>
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt<br>
The newest state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;This is the sergeant<br>
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought<br>
&#8217;Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!<br>
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil<br>
As thou didst leave it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sergeant</p>
<p class="speech">Doubtful it stood;<br>
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together<br>
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald&#8212;<br>
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<br>
The multiplying villanies of nature<br>
Do swarm upon him&#8212;from the western isles<br>
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<br>
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<br>
Show&#8217;d like a rebel&#8217;s whore: but all&#8217;s too
weak:<br>
For brave Macbeth&#8212;well he deserves that name&#8212;<br>
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish&#8217;d steel,<br>
Which smoked with bloody execution,<br>
Like valour&#8217;s minion carved out his passage<br>
Till he faced the slave;<br>
Which ne&#8217;er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<br>
Till he unseam&#8217;d him from the nave to the chaps,<br>
And fix&#8217;d his head upon our battlements.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sergeant</p>
<p class="speech">As whence the sun &#8217;gins his reflection<br>
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,<br>
So from that spring whence comfort seem&#8217;d to come<br>
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:<br>
No sooner justice had with valour arm&#8217;d<br>
Compell&#8217;d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<br>
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,<br>
With furbish&#8217;d arms and new supplies of men<br>
Began a fresh assault.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">Dismay&#8217;d not this<br>
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sergeant</p>
<p class="speech">Yes;<br>
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<br>
If I say sooth, I must report they were<br>
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they<br>
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<br>
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<br>
Or memorise another Golgotha,<br>
I cannot tell.<br>
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;<br>
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.</p>

attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Who comes here?</p>

<p class="speaker">Lennox</p>
<p class="speech">What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he
look<br>
That seems to speak things strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">God save the king!</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">From Fife, great king;<br>
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky<br>
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,<br>
With terrible numbers,<br>
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor<br>
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;<br>
Till that Bellona&#8217;s bridegroom, lapp&#8217;d in proof,<br>
Confronted him with self-comparisons,<br>
Point against point rebellious, arm &#8217;gainst arm.<br>
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,<br>
The victory fell on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">Great happiness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">That now<br>
Sweno, the Norways&#8217; king, craves composition:<br>
Nor would we deign him burial of his men<br>
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme&#8217;s inch<br>
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>
<p class="speech">No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive<br>
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,<br>
And with his former title greet Macbeth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>

&#8216;Aroint thee, witch!&#8217; the rump-fed ronyon cries.<br>
Her husband&#8217;s to Aleppo gone, master o&#8217; the Tiger:<br>
But in a sieve I&#8217;ll thither sail,<br>
And, like a rat without a tail,<br>
I&#8217;ll do, I&#8217;ll do, and I&#8217;ll do.</p>

Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:<br>
Though his bark cannot be lost,<br>

<p class="speech">How far is&#8217;t call&#8217;d to Forres? What
are these<br>
So wither&#8217;d and so wild in their attire,<br>
That look not like the inhabitants o&#8217; the earth,<br>
And yet are on&#8217;t? Live you? or are you aught<br>
That man may question? You seem to understand me,<br>
By each at once her chappy finger laying<br>
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,<br>
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<br>
That you are so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Speak, if you can: what are
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Witch</p>

Cawdor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Witch</p>
<p class="speech">All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king
hereafter!</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear<br>
Things that do sound so fair? I&#8217; the name of truth,<br>
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed<br>
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner<br>
You greet with present grace and great prediction<br>
Of noble having and of royal hope,<br>
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.<br>
If you can look into the seeds of time,<br>
And say which grain will grow and which will not,<br>
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear<br>
Your favours nor your hate.</p>

<p class="speech">Hail!</p>

So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Witch</p>
<p class="speech">Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:<br>
By Sinel&#8217;s death I know I am thane of Glamis;<br>
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,<br>
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king<br>
Stands not within the prospect of belief,<br>
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence<br>
You owe this strange intelligence? or why<br>
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way<br>
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Witches vanish</span></p>

And these are of them. Whither are they vanish&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Into the air; and what seem&#8217;d corporal
melted<br>
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>

Or have we eaten on the insane root<br>
That takes the reason prisoner?</p>

<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be king.</p>

here?</p>

Angus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">The king hath happily received, Macbeth,<br>
The news of thy success; and when he reads<br>
Thy personal venture in the rebels&#8217; fight,<br>
His wonders and his praises do contend<br>
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,<br>
In viewing o&#8217;er the rest o&#8217; the selfsame day,<br>
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,<br>
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,<br>
Strange images of death. As thick as hail<br>
Came post with post; and every one did bear<br>
Thy praises in his kingdom&#8217;s great defence,<br>
And pour&#8217;d them down before him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angus</p>
<p class="speech">We are sent<br>
To give thee from our royal master thanks;<br>
Only to herald thee into his sight,<br>
Not pay thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">And, for an earnest of a greater honour,<br>
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:<br>
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!<br>
For it is thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What, can the devil speak true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress
me<br>
In borrow&#8217;d robes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Who was the thane lives yet;<br>
But under heavy judgment bears that life<br>
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined<br>
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel<br>
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both<br>
He labour&#8217;d in his country&#8217;s wreck, I know not;<br>
But treasons capital, confess&#8217;d and proved,<br>
Have overthrown him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Glamis, and
thane of Cawdor!<br>
The greatest is behind.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Ross and Angus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thanks for your pains.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Banquo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Do you not hope your children shall be kings,<br>
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me<br>
Promised no less to them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">That trusted home<br>
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,<br>
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But &#8217;tis strange:<br>
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<br>
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<br>
Win us with honest trifles, to betray&#8217;s<br>
In deepest consequence.<br>
Cousins, a word, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Two truths are
told,<br>
As happy prologues to the swelling act<br>
Of the imperial theme.&#8212;I thank you, gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,<br>
Why hath it given me earnest of success,<br>
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:<br>
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion<br>
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair<br>
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<br>
Against the use of nature? Present fears<br>
Are less than horrible imaginings:<br>
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,<br>
Shakes so my single state of man that function<br>
Is smother&#8217;d in surmise, and nothing is<br>
But what is not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Look, how our partner&#8217;s
rapt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If chance will
have me king, why, chance may crown me,<br>
Without my stir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;New horrors come upon him,<br>
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould<br>
But with the aid of use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Come what come
may,<br>
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banquo</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your favour: my dull brain was
wrought<br>
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains<br>

They are not yet come back. But I have spoke<br>
With one that saw him die: who did report<br>
That very frankly he confess&#8217;d his treasons,<br>
Implored your highness&#8217; pardon and set forth<br>
A deep repentance: nothing in his life<br>
Became him like the leaving it; he died<br>

To throw away the dearest thing he owed,<br>
As &#8217;twere a careless trifle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duncan</p>

The sin of my ingratitude even now<br>
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before<br>
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow<br>
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,<br>
That the proportion both of thanks and payment<br>
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,<br>
More is thy due than more than all can pay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">The service and the loyalty I owe,<br>
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness&#8217; part<br>

Are to your throne and state children and servants,<br>
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing<br>
Safe toward your love and honour.</p>

<p class="speech">Welcome hither:<br>
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour<br>
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,<br>

No less to have done so, let me enfold thee<br>

In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,<br>

We will establish our estate upon<br>
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter<br>
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must<br>
Not unaccompanied invest him only,<br>

<p class="speech">&#8216;They met me in the day of success: and I
have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
all-hailed me &#8216;Thane of Cawdor;&#8217; by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with &#8216;Hail, king that
shalt be!&#8217; This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech">
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be<br>
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;<br>
It is too full o&#8217; the milk of human kindness<br>
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;<br>
Art not without ambition, but without<br>
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,<br>
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,<br>
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou&#8217;ldst have, great
Glamis,<br>
That which cries &#8216;Thus thou must do, if thou have it;<br>
And that which rather thou dost fear to do<br>
Than wishest should be undone.&#8217; Hie thee hither,<br>
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;<br>
And chastise with the valour of my tongue<br>
All that impedes thee from the golden round,<br>
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<br>
To have thee crown&#8217;d withal.</p>

And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<br>
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;<br>
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,<br>
That no compunctious visitings of nature<br>
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between<br>
The effect and it! Come to my woman&#8217;s breasts,<br>
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,<br>
Wherever in your sightless substances<br>
You wait on nature&#8217;s mischief! Come, thick night,<br>
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,<br>

Golden opinions from all sorts of people,<br>

Not cast aside so soon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Was the hope drunk<br>
Wherein you dress&#8217;d yourself? hath it slept since?<br>
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale<br>
At what it did so freely? From this time<br>
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard<br>
To be the same in thine own act and valour<br>
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that<br>
Which thou esteem&#8217;st the ornament of life,<br>
And live a coward in thine own esteem,<br>

That made you break this enterprise to me?<br>
When you durst do it, then you were a man;<br>
And, to be more than what you were, you would<br>
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place<br>
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:<br>
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now<br>
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know<br>
How tender &#8217;tis to love the babe that milks me:<br>
I would, while it was smiling in my face,<br>
Have pluck&#8217;d my nipple from his boneless gums,<br>

Have done to this.</p>

A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep<br>
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,<br>

His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt<br>
Of our great quell?</p>

Nothing but males. Will it not be received,<br>

<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s one did laugh in&#8217;s sleep, and
one cried<br>
&#8216;Murder!&#8217;<br>
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:<br>
But they did say their prayers, and address&#8217;d them<br>
Again to sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;There are two lodged together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">One cried &#8216;God bless us!&#8217; and
&#8216;Amen&#8217; the other;<br>
As they had seen me with these hangman&#8217;s hands.<br>
Listening their fear, I could not say &#8216;Amen,&#8217;<br>
When they did say &#8216;God bless us!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Consider it not so deeply.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">But wherefore could not I pronounce
&#8216;Amen&#8217;?<br>
I had most need of blessing, and &#8216;Amen&#8217;<br>
Stuck in my throat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">These deeds must not be thought<br>
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Methought I heard a voice cry &#8216;sleep no
more!<br>
Macbeth does murder sleep&#8217;, the innocent sleep,<br>
Sleep that knits up the ravell&#8217;d sleeve of care,<br>
The death of each day&#8217;s life, sore labour&#8217;s bath,<br>
Balm of hurt minds, great nature&#8217;s second course,<br>
Chief nourisher in life&#8217;s feast,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Still it cried &#8216;sleep no more!&#8217; to
all the house:<br>
&#8216;Glamis hath murder&#8217;d sleep, and therefore Cawdor<br>
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy
thane,<br>
You do unbend your noble strength, to think<br>
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,<br>
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.<br>
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?<br>
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear<br>
The sleepy grooms with blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll go no more:<br>
I am afraid to think what I have done;<br>
Look on&#8217;t again I dare not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Infirm of purpose!<br>
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead<br>
Are but as pictures: &#8217;tis the eye of childhood<br>
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,<br>
I&#8217;ll gild the faces of the grooms withal;<br>
For it must seem their guilt.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit. Knocking
within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Whence is that knocking?<br>
How is&#8217;t with me, when every noise appals me?<br>
What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.<br>
Will all great Neptune&#8217;s ocean wash this blood<br>
Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather<br>
The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,<br>
Making the green one red.</p>

Hath left you unattended.</p>

knock, knock! Who&#8217;s there, i&#8217; the name of
Beelzebub? Here&#8217;s a farmer, that hanged
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in

knock! Who&#8217;s there, in the other devil&#8217;s

swear in both the scales against either scale;
who committed treason enough for God&#8217;s sake,
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
in, equivocator.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Knocking within</span></p>

<p class="speech">Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,<br>
That you do lie so late?</p>
<p class="speaker">Porter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith sir, we were carousing till the
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
provoker of three things.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">What three things does drink especially
provoke?</p>
<p class="speaker">Porter</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
it provokes the desire, but it takes
away the performance: therefore, much drink
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Porter</p>
<p class="speech">That it did, sir, i&#8217; the very throat on
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
think, being too strong for him, though he took
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
him.</p>

And prophesying with accents terrible<br>

&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;<br>
And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Banquo</span></p>
<p class="speech">Let every man be master of his time<br>
Till seven at night: to make society<br>
The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself<br>
Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Macbeth, and
an attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men<br>
Our pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">They are, my lord, without the palace gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Bring them before us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">To be thus is nothing;<br>
But to be safely thus.&#8212;Our fears in Banquo<br>
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<br>
Reigns that which would be fear&#8217;d: &#8217;tis much he
dares;<br>
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<br>
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<br>
To act in safety. There is none but he<br>
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<br>
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,<br>
Mark Antony&#8217;s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<br>
When first they put the name of king upon me,<br>
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<br>
They hail&#8217;d him father to a line of kings:<br>
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<br>
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<br>
Thence to be wrench&#8217;d with an unlineal hand,<br>
No son of mine succeeding. If &#8217;t be so,<br>
For Banquo&#8217;s issue have I filed my mind;<br>
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder&#8217;d;<br>
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<br>
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<br>
Given to the common enemy of man,<br>
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<br>
Rather than so, come fate into the list.<br>
And champion me to the utterance! Who&#8217;s there!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendant, with two
Murderers</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now go to the door, and stay there till we
call.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Was it not yesterday we spoke together?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">It was, so please your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Well then, now<br>
Have you consider&#8217;d of my speeches? Know<br>
That it was he in the times past which held you<br>
So under fortune, which you thought had been<br>
Our innocent self: this I made good to you<br>
In our last conference, pass&#8217;d in probation with you,<br>
How you were borne in hand, how cross&#8217;d,
the instruments,<br>
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might<br>
To half a soul and to a notion crazed<br>
Say &#8216;Thus did Banquo.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">You made it known to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">I did so, and went further, which is now<br>
Our point of second meeting. Do you find<br>
Your patience so predominant in your nature<br>
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell&#8217;d<br>
To pray for this good man and for his issue,<br>
Whose heavy hand hath bow&#8217;d you to the grave<br>
And beggar&#8217;d yours for ever?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">We are men, my liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;<br>
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<br>
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept<br>
All by the name of dogs: the valued file<br>
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,<br>
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one<br>
According to the gift which bounteous nature<br>
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive<br>
Particular addition. from the bill<br>
That writes them all alike: and so of men.<br>
Now, if you have a station in the file,<br>
Not i&#8217; the worst rank of manhood, say &#8217;t;<br>
And I will put that business in your bosoms,<br>
Whose execution takes your enemy off,<br>
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,<br>
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,<br>
Which in his death were perfect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I am one, my liege,<br>
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<br>
Have so incensed that I am reckless what<br>
I do to spite the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And I another<br>
So weary with disasters, tugg&#8217;d with fortune,<br>
That I would set my lie on any chance,<br>
To mend it, or be rid on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Both of you<br>
Know Banquo was your enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both Murderers</p>
<p class="speech">True, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,<br>
That every minute of his being thrusts<br>
Against my near&#8217;st of life: and though I could<br>
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight<br>
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,<br>
For certain friends that are both his and mine,<br>
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall<br>
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,<br>
That I to your assistance do make love,<br>
Masking the business from the common eye<br>
For sundry weighty reasons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">We shall, my lord,<br>
Perform what you command us.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Though our lives&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour
at most<br>
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;<br>
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o&#8217; the time,<br>
The moment on&#8217;t; for&#8217;t must be done to-night,<br>
And something from the palace; always thought<br>
That I require a clearness: and with him&#8212;<br>
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&#8212;<br>
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,<br>
Whose absence is no less material to me<br>
Than is his father&#8217;s, must embrace the fate<br>
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:<br>
I&#8217;ll come to you anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both Murderers</p>
<p class="speech">We are resolved, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll call upon you straight: abide
within.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Murderers</span></p>
<p class="speech">It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul&#8217;s

If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.</p>

<p class="speech">Is Banquo gone from court?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.</p>

<p class="speech">Nought&#8217;s had, all&#8217;s spent,<br>
Where our desire is got without content:<br>
&#8217;Tis safer to be that which we destroy<br>
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Macbeth</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,<br>
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,<br>
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died<br>
With them they think on? Things without all remedy<br>
Should be without regard: what&#8217;s done is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">We have scotch&#8217;d the snake, not
kill&#8217;d it:<br>
She&#8217;ll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice<br>
Remains in danger of her former tooth.<br>
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
worlds suffer,<br>
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep<br>
In the affliction of these terrible dreams<br>
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,<br>
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<br>
Than on the torture of the mind to lie<br>
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<br>
After life&#8217;s fitful fever he sleeps well;<br>
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,<br>
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,<br>
Can touch him further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Come on;<br>
Gentle my lord, sleek o&#8217;er your rugged looks;<br>
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:<br>
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;<br>
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:<br>
Unsafe the while, that we<br>
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,<br>
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,<br>
Disguising what they are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">You must leave this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!<br>
Thou know&#8217;st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">But in them nature&#8217;s copy&#8217;s not
eterne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s comfort yet; they are
assailable;<br>
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown<br>
His cloister&#8217;d flight, ere to black Hecate&#8217;s
summons<br>
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums<br>
Hath rung night&#8217;s yawning peal, there shall be done<br>
A deed of dreadful note.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s to be done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Macbeth</p>
<p class="speech">Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,<br>
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,<br>
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;<br>
And with thy bloody and invisible hand<br>
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond<br>
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow<br>
Makes wing to the rooky wood:<br>
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;<br>
While night&#8217;s black agents to their preys do rouse.<br>
Thou marvell&#8217;st at my words: but hold thee still;<br>
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.<br>
So, prithee, go with me.</p>

I keep a servant fee&#8217;d. I will to-morrow,<br>
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:<br>
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,<br>
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,<br>
All causes shall give way: I am in blood<br>
Stepp&#8217;d in so far that, should I wade no more,<br>
Returning were as tedious as go o&#8217;er:<br>

Lord</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lennox</p>
<p class="speech">My former speeches have but hit your
thoughts,<br>
Which can interpret further: only, I say,<br>
Things have been strangely borne. The
gracious Duncan<br>
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:<br>
And the right-valiant Banquo walk&#8217;d too late;<br>
Whom, you may say, if&#8217;t please you, Fleance kill&#8217;d,<br>
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.<br>
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous<br>
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<br>
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<br>
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight<br>
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,<br>
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<br>
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<br>
For &#8217;twould have anger&#8217;d any heart alive<br>
To hear the men deny&#8217;t. So that, I say,<br>
He has borne all things well: and I do think<br>
That had he Duncan&#8217;s sons under his key&#8212;<br>
As, an&#8217;t please heaven, he shall not&#8212;they
should find<br>
What &#8217;twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<br>
But, peace! for from broad words and &#8217;cause he
fail&#8217;d<br>
His presence at the tyrant&#8217;s feast, I hear<br>
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell<br>
Where he bestows himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The son of Duncan,<br>
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth<br>
Lives in the English court, and is received<br>
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<br>
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<br>
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff<br>
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<br>
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:<br>
That, by the help of these&#8212;with Him above<br>
To ratify the work&#8212;we may again<br>
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,<br>
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<br>
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:<br>
All which we pine for now: and this report<br>
Hath so exasperate the king that he<br>
Prepares for some attempt of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lennox</p>
<p class="speech">Sent he to Macduff?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He did: and with an absolute &#8216;sir, not
I,&#8217;<br>
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,<br>
And hums, as who should say &#8216;You&#8217;ll rue the time<br>
That clogs me with this answer.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lennox</p>
<p class="speech">And that well might<br>
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance<br>
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel<br>
Fly to the court of England and unfold<br>
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing<br>
May soon return to this our suffering country<br>
Under a hand accursed!</p>

I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:<br>
If you will take a homely man&#8217;s advice,<br>
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.<br>
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;<br>
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,<br>
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!<br>

I am in this earthly world; where to do harm<br>
Is often laudable, to do good sometime<br>
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,<br>
Do I put up that womanly defence,<br>
To say I have done no harm?</p>

<h4>Scene III. England. Before the King&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Malcolm and
Macduff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Let us seek out some desolate shade, and
there<br>
Weep our sad bosoms empty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Let us rather<br>
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men<br>
Bestride our down-fall&#8217;n birthdom: each new morn<br>
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows<br>
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds<br>
As if it felt with Scotland and yell&#8217;d out<br>
Like syllable of dolour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">What I believe I&#8217;ll wail,<br>
What know believe, and what I can redress,<br>
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.<br>
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.<br>
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<br>
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.<br>
He hath not touch&#8217;d you yet. I am young;
but something<br>
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom<br>
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb<br>
To appease an angry god.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">I am not treacherous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">But Macbeth is.<br>
A good and virtuous nature may recoil<br>
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
your pardon;<br>
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:<br>
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;<br>
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<br>
Yet grace must still look so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">I have lost my hopes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance even there where I did find my
doubts.<br>
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,<br>
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,<br>
Without leave-taking? I pray you,<br>
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,<br>
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,<br>
Whatever I shall think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Bleed, bleed, poor country!<br>
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,<br>
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
thy wrongs;<br>
The title is affeer&#8217;d! Fare thee well, lord:<br>
I would not be the villain that thou think&#8217;st<br>
For the whole space that&#8217;s in the tyrant&#8217;s grasp,<br>
And the rich East to boot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Be not offended:<br>
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<br>
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;<br>
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash<br>
Is added to her wounds: I think withal<br>
There would be hands uplifted in my right;<br>
And here from gracious England have I offer<br>
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<br>
When I shall tread upon the tyrant&#8217;s head,<br>
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country<br>
Shall have more vices than it had before,<br>
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,<br>
By him that shall succeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">What should he be?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">It is myself I mean: in whom I know<br>
All the particulars of vice so grafted<br>
That, when they shall be open&#8217;d, black Macbeth<br>
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state<br>
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared<br>
With my confineless harms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Not in the legions<br>
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn&#8217;d<br>
In evils to top Macbeth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">I grant him bloody,<br>
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<br>
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<br>
That has a name: but there&#8217;s no bottom, none,<br>
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<br>
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<br>
The cistern of my lust, and my desire<br>
All continent impediments would o&#8217;erbear<br>
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth<br>
Than such an one to reign.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Boundless intemperance<br>
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<br>
The untimely emptying of the happy throne<br>
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<br>
To take upon you what is yours: you may<br>
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<br>
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.<br>
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be<br>
That vulture in you, to devour so many<br>
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<br>
Finding it so inclined.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">With this there grows<br>
In my most ill-composed affection such<br>
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,<br>
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,<br>
Desire his jewels and this other&#8217;s house:<br>
And my more-having would be as a sauce<br>
To make me hunger more; that I should forge<br>
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<br>
Destroying them for wealth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">This avarice<br>
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root<br>
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been<br>
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<br>
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.<br>
Of your mere own: all these are portable,<br>
With other graces weigh&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<br>
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,<br>
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<br>
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<br>
I have no relish of them, but abound<br>
In the division of each several crime,<br>
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<br>
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<br>
Uproar the universal peace, confound<br>
All unity on earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">O Scotland, Scotland!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<br>
I am as I have spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Fit to govern!<br>
No, not to live. O nation miserable,<br>
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter&#8217;d,<br>
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<br>
Since that the truest issue of thy throne<br>
By his own interdiction stands accursed,<br>
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<br>
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,<br>
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,<br>
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<br>
These evils thou repeat&#8217;st upon thyself<br>
Have banish&#8217;d me from Scotland. O my breast,<br>
Thy hope ends here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Macduff, this noble passion,<br>
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<br>
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts<br>
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<br>
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<br>
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<br>
From over-credulous haste: but God above<br>
Deal between thee and me! for even now<br>
I put myself to thy direction, and<br>
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure<br>
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<br>
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<br>
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,<br>
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,<br>
At no time broke my faith, would not betray<br>
The devil to his fellow and delight<br>
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<br>
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,<br>
Is thine and my poor country&#8217;s to command:<br>
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,<br>
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<br>
Already at a point, was setting forth.<br>
Now we&#8217;ll together; and the chance of goodness<br>
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<br>
&#8217;Tis hard to reconcile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Doctor</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Well; more anon.&#8212;Comes the king forth, I
pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls<br>
That stay his cure: their malady convinces<br>
The great assay of art; but at his touch&#8212;<br>
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand&#8212;<br>
They presently amend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Doctor</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the disease he means?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis call&#8217;d the evil:<br>
A most miraculous work in this good king;<br>
Which often, since my here-remain in England,<br>
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,<br>
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,<br>
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,<br>
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,<br>
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,<br>
Put on with holy prayers: and &#8217;tis spoken,<br>
To the succeeding royalty he leaves<br>
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,<br>
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,<br>
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,<br>
That speak him full of grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ross</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">See, who comes here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">My countryman; but yet I know him not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">I know him now. Good God, betimes remove<br>
The means that makes us strangers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Stands Scotland where it did?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor country!<br>
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot<br>
Be call&#8217;d our mother, but our grave; where nothing,<br>
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;<br>
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air<br>
Are made, not mark&#8217;d; where violent sorrow seems<br>
A modern ecstasy; the dead man&#8217;s knell<br>
Is there scarce ask&#8217;d for who; and good men&#8217;s lives<br>
Expire before the flowers in their caps,<br>
Dying or ere they sicken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">O, relation<br>
Too nice, and yet too true!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the newest grief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">That of an hour&#8217;s age doth hiss the
speaker:<br>
Each minute teems a new one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">How does my wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Why, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And all my children?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Well too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">The tyrant has not batter&#8217;d at their
peace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">No; they were well at peace when I did leave
&#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">But not a niggard of your speech: how
goes&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">When I came hither to transport the tidings,<br>
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<br>
Of many worthy fellows that were out;<br>
Which was to my belief witness&#8217;d the rather,<br>
For that I saw the tyrant&#8217;s power a-foot:<br>
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland<br>
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<br>
To doff their dire distresses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Be&#8217;t their comfort<br>
We are coming thither: gracious England hath<br>
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<br>
An older and a better soldier none<br>
That Christendom gives out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Would I could answer<br>
This comfort with the like! But I have words<br>
That would be howl&#8217;d out in the desert air,<br>
Where hearing should not latch them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">What concern they?<br>
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<br>
Due to some single breast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">No mind that&#8217;s honest<br>
But in it shares some woe; though the main part<br>
Pertains to you alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">If it be mine,<br>
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<br>
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<br>
That ever yet they heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">Hum! I guess at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes<br>
Savagely slaughter&#8217;d: to relate the manner,<br>
Were, on the quarry of these murder&#8217;d deer,<br>
To add the death of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Merciful heaven!<br>
What, man! ne&#8217;er pull your hat upon your brows;<br>
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak<br>
Whispers the o&#8217;er-fraught heart and bids it break.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">My children too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Wife, children, servants, all<br>
That could be found.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">And I must be from thence!<br>
My wife kill&#8217;d too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ross</p>
<p class="speech">I have said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Be comforted:<br>
Let&#8217;s make us medicines of our great revenge,<br>
To cure this deadly grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">He has no children. All my pretty ones?<br>
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?<br>
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<br>
At one fell swoop?</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Dispute it like a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">I shall do so;<br>
But I must also feel it as a man:<br>
I cannot but remember such things were,<br>
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,<br>
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<br>
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,<br>
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<br>
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">Be this the whetstone of your sword: let
grief<br>
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Macduff</p>
<p class="speech">O, I could play the woman with mine eyes<br>
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,<br>
Cut short all intermission; front to front<br>
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<br>
Within my sword&#8217;s length set him; if he &#8217;scape,<br>
Heaven forgive him too!</p>
<p class="speaker">Malcolm</p>
<p class="speech">This tune goes manly.<br>
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;<br>
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth<br>
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<br>
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:<br>
The night is long that never finds the day.</p>

her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
