<h4>Scene I. A room in Lucullus&#8217; house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flaminius waiting. Enter a
Servant to him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucullus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> One of Lord
Timon&#8217;s men? a gift, I
warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver
basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.
Fill me some wine.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servants</span></p>
<p class="speech">And how does that honourable, complete,
free-hearted
gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
and master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">His health is well sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">I am right glad that his health is well, sir:
and
what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir;
which, in my
lord&#8217;s behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
supply; who, having great and instant occasion to
use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
furnish him, nothing doubting your present
assistance therein.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">La, la, la, la! &#8216;nothing doubting,&#8217;
says he? Alas,
good lord! a noble gentleman &#8217;tis, if he would not
keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha&#8217;
dined with him, and told him on&#8217;t, and come again to
supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty
is his: I ha&#8217; told him on&#8217;t, but I could ne&#8217;er
get
him from&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Servant, with
wine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Please your lordship, here is the wine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise.
Here&#8217;s to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship speaks your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">I have observed thee always for a towardly
prompt
spirit&#8212;give thee thy due&#8212;and one that knows what
belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
the time use thee well: good parts in thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Get you gone, sirrah.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord&#8217;s
a
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
bare friendship, without security. Here&#8217;s three
solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible the world should so much
differ,<br>
And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,<br>
To him that worships thee!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throwing the money
back</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy
master.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">May these add to the number that may scald
thee!<br>
Let moulten coin be thy damnation,<br>
Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!<br>
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,<br>
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,<br>
I feel master&#8217;s passion! this slave,<br>
Unto his honour, has my lord&#8217;s meat in him:<br>
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,<br>
When he is turn&#8217;d to poison?<br>
O, may diseases only work upon&#8217;t!<br>
And, when he&#8217;s sick to death, let not that part of nature<br>
Which my lord paid for, be of any power<br>
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</p>

<h4>Scene II. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucilius, with three
Strangers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend,
and
an honourable gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">We know him for no less, though we are but
strangers
to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon&#8217;s
happy hours are done and past, and his estate
shrinks from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for
money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">But believe you this, my lord, that, not long
ago,
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
so many talents, nay, urged extremely for&#8217;t and
showed what necessity belonged to&#8217;t, and yet was denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">How!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you, denied, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">What a strange case was that! now, before the
gods,
I am ashamed on&#8217;t. Denied that honourable man!
there was very little honour showed in&#8217;t. For my own
part, I must needs confess, I have received some
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
ne&#8217;er have denied his occasion so many talents.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Servilius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">See, by good hap, yonder&#8217;s my lord;<br>
I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee
well:
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
exquisite friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">May it please your honour, my lord hath
sent&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared
to
that lord; he&#8217;s ever sending: how shall I thank
him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Has only sent his present occasion now, my
lord;
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">I know his lordship is but merry with me;<br>
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.<br>
If his occasion were not virtuous,<br>
I should not urge it half so faithfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my soul,&#8217;tis true, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish
myself
against such a good time, when I might ha&#8217; shown
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
should purchase the day before for a little part,
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
before the gods, I am not able to do,&#8212;the more
beast, I say:&#8212;I was sending to use Lord Timon
myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done&#8217;t now.
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
this from me, I count it one of my greatest
afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir, I shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll look you out a good turn,
Servilius.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servilius</span></p>
<p class="speech">True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;<br>
And he that&#8217;s once denied will hardly speed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Do you observe this, Hostilius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, too well.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is the world&#8217;s soul; and just of
the
same piece<br>
Is every flatterer&#8217;s spirit. Who can call him<br>
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in<br>
My knowing, Timon has been this lord&#8217;s father,<br>
And kept his credit with his purse,<br>
Supported his estate; nay, Timon&#8217;s money<br>
Has paid his men their wages: he ne&#8217;er drinks,<br>
But Timon&#8217;s silver treads upon his lip;<br>
And yet&#8212;O, see the monstrousness of man<br>
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&#8212;<br>
He does deny him, in respect of his,<br>
What charitable men afford to beggars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Religion groans at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">For mine own part,<br>
I never tasted Timon in my life,<br>
Nor came any of his bounties over me,<br>
To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,<br>
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue<br>
And honourable carriage,<br>
Had his necessity made use of me,<br>
I would have put my wealth into donation,<br>
And the best half should have return&#8217;d to him,<br>
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,<br>
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;<br>
For policy sits above conscience.</p>

<h4>Scene III. A room in Sempronius&#8217; house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sempronius, and a
Servant of Timon&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sempronius</p>
<p class="speech">Must he needs trouble me in
&#8217;t,&#8212;hum!&#8212;&#8217;bove
all others?<br>
He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;<br>
And now Ventidius is wealthy too,<br>
Whom he redeem&#8217;d from prison: all these<br>
Owe their estates unto him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
They have all been touch&#8217;d and found base metal, for<br>
They have au denied him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sempronius</p>
<p class="speech">How! have they denied him?<br>
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?<br>
And does he send to me? Three? hum!<br>
It shows but little love or judgment in him:<br>
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
physicians,<br>
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?<br>
Has much disgraced me in&#8217;t; I&#8217;m angry at him,<br>
That might have known my place: I see no sense for&#8217;t,<br>
But his occasion might have woo&#8217;d me first;<br>
For, in my conscience, I was the first man<br>
That e&#8217;er received gift from him:<br>
And does he think so backwardly of me now,<br>
That I&#8217;ll requite its last? No:<br>
So it may prove an argument of laughter<br>
To the rest, and &#8217;mongst lords I be thought a fool.<br>
I&#8217;ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,<br>
Had sent to me first, but for my mind&#8217;s sake;<br>
I&#8217;d such a courage to do him good. But now return,<br>
And with their faint reply this answer join;<br>
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent! Your lordship&#8217;s a goodly
villain. The
devil knew not what he did when he made man
politic; he crossed himself by &#8217;t: and I cannot
think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
politic love.<br>
This was my lord&#8217;s best hope; now all are fled,<br>
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,<br>
Doors, that were ne&#8217;er acquainted with their wards<br>
Many a bounteous year must be employ&#8217;d<br>
Now to guard sure their master.<br>
And this is all a liberal course allows;<br>
Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.</p>

What, do we meet together?<br>
Lucilius&#8217; Servant Ay, and I think<br>
One business does command us all; for mine Is money.</p>

<p class="speech">So is theirs and ours.</p>

Lucilius&#8217; Servant So much?</p>

Lucilius&#8217; Servant Not yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philotus</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder on&#8217;t; he was wont to shine at
seven.<br>
Lucilius&#8217; Servant Ay, but the days are wax&#8217;d shorter
with him:<br>
You must consider that a prodigal course<br>
Is like the sun&#8217;s; but not, like his, recoverable.<br>
I fear &#8217;tis deepest winter in Lord Timon&#8217;s purse;<br>
That is one may reach deep enough, and yet<br>
Find little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Philotus</p>
<p class="speech">I am of your fear for that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll show you how to observe a strange
event.<br>
Your lord sends now for money.</p>

<p class="speech">Most true, he does.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus</p>
<p class="speech">And he wears jewels now of Timon&#8217;s
gift,<br>
For which I wait for money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensius</p>
<p class="speech">It is against my heart.<br>
Lucilius&#8217; Servant Mark, how strange it shows,<br>
Timon in this should pay more than he owes:<br>
And e&#8217;en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,<br>
And send for money for &#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensius</p>

Why then preferr&#8217;d you not your sums and bills,<br>

gluttonous maws.<br>

some
other hour, I should derive much from&#8217;t; for,
take&#8217;t of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
he&#8217;s much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
Lucilius&#8217; Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not
sick:<br>
And, if it be so far beyond his health,<br>
Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,<br>
And make a clear way to the gods.</p>

<h4>Scene V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.</h4>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you have my voice to it; the
fault&#8217;s<br>
Bloody; &#8217;tis necessary he should die:<br>
Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Most true; the law shall bruise him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alcibiades, with
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Now, captain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I am an humble suitor to your virtues;<br>
For pity is the virtue of the law,<br>
And none but tyrants use it cruelly.<br>
It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy<br>
Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,<br>
Hath stepp&#8217;d into the law, which is past depth<br>
To those that, without heed, do plunge into &#8217;t.<br>
He is a man, setting his fate aside,<br>
Of comely virtues:<br>
Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice&#8212;<br>
An honour in him which buys out his fault&#8212;<br>
But with a noble fury and fair spirit,<br>
Seeing his reputation touch&#8217;d to death,<br>
He did oppose his foe:<br>
And with such sober and unnoted passion<br>
He did behave his anger, ere &#8217;twas spent,<br>
As if he had but proved an argument.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">You undergo too strict a paradox,<br>
Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:<br>
Your words have took such pains as if they labour&#8217;d<br>
To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling<br>
Upon the head of valour; which indeed<br>
Is valour misbegot and came into the world<br>
When sects and factions were newly born:<br>
He&#8217;s truly valiant that can wisely suffer<br>
The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs<br>
His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
carelessly,<br>
And ne&#8217;er prefer his injuries to his heart,<br>
To bring it into danger.<br>
If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,<br>
What folly &#8217;tis to hazard life for ill!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You cannot make gross sins look
clear:<br>
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,<br>
If I speak like a captain.<br>
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,<br>
And not endure all threats? sleep upon&#8217;t,<br>
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,<br>
Without repugnancy? If there be<br>
Such valour in the bearing, what make we<br>
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant<br>
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,<br>
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon<br>
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,<br>
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,<br>
As you are great, be pitifully good:<br>
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?<br>
To kill, I grant, is sin&#8217;s extremest gust;<br>
But, in defence, by mercy, &#8217;tis most just.<br>
To be in anger is impiety;<br>
But who is man that is not angry?<br>
Weigh but the crime with this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">You breathe in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">In vain! his service done<br>
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium<br>
Were a sufficient briber for his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I say, my lords, he has done fair service,<br>
And slain in fight many of your enemies:<br>
How full of valour did he bear himself<br>
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">He has made too much plenty with &#8217;em;<br>
He&#8217;s a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often<br>
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:<br>
If there were no foes, that were enough<br>
To overcome him: in that beastly fury<br>
He has been known to commit outrages,<br>
And cherish factions: &#8217;tis inferr&#8217;d to us,<br>
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">He dies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Hard fate! he might have died in war.<br>
My lords, if not for any parts in him&#8212;<br>
Though his right arm might purchase his own time<br>
And be in debt to none&#8212;yet, more to move you,<br>
Take my deserts to his, and join &#8217;em both:<br>
And, for I know your reverend ages love<br>
Security, I&#8217;ll pawn my victories, all<br>
My honours to you, upon his good returns.<br>
If by this crime he owes the law his life,<br>
Why, let the war receive &#8217;t in valiant gore<br>
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,<br>
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,<br>
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,<br>
I do beseech you, know me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">How!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Call me to your remembrances.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot think but your age has forgot me;<br>
It could not else be, I should prove so base,<br>
To sue, and be denied such common grace:<br>
My wounds ache at you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Do you dare our anger?<br>
&#8217;Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;<br>
We banish thee for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Banish me!<br>
Banish your dotage; banish usury,<br>
That makes the senate ugly.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">If, after two days&#8217; shine, Athens contain
thee,<br>
Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
our spirit,<br>
He shall be executed presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Senators</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may
live<br>
Only in bone, that none may look on you!<br>
I&#8217;m worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,<br>
While they have told their money and let out<br>
Their coin upon large interest, I myself<br>
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?<br>
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate<br>
Pours into captains&#8217; wounds? Banishment!<br>
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish&#8217;d;<br>
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,<br>
That I may strike at Athens. I&#8217;ll cheer up<br>
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.<br>
&#8217;Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;<br>
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.</p>

<p class="speech">I also wish it to you. I think this honourable
lord
did but try us this other day.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">It should not be, by the persuasion of his new
feasting.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
I must needs appear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">In like manner was I in debt to my
importunate
business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am
sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
provision was out.</p>

things go.</p>

I was so unfortunate a beggar.</p>

<p class="speaker">Third Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I do conceive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would
to
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
one need not lend to another; for, were your
godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
the table, let a dozen of them be&#8212;as they are. The
rest of your fees, O gods&#8212;the senators of Athens,
together with the common lag of people&#8212;what is
amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
destruction. For these my present friends, as they
are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
nothing are they welcome.
Uncover, dogs, and lap.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The dishes are uncovered and

<p class="speech">What does his lordship mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Some Others</p>
<p class="speech">I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">May you a better feast never behold,<br>
You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water<br>
Is your perfection. This is Timon&#8217;s last;<br>
Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,<br>
Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces<br>
Your reeking villany.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throwing the water in their
faces</span></p>
<p class="speech">Live loathed and long,<br>
Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,<br>
Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,<br>
You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time&#8217;s flies,<br>
Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!<br>
Of man and beast the infinite malady<br>
Crust you quite o&#8217;er! What, dost thou go?<br>
