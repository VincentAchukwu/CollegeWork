<h4>Scene I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles&#8217; tent.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Achilles and
Patroclus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll heat his blood with Greekish wine
to-night,<br>
Which with my scimitar I&#8217;ll cool to-morrow.<br>
Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Thersites.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thersites</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">How now, thou core of envy!<br>
Thou crusty batch of nature, what&#8217;s the news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and
idol
of idiot worshippers, here&#8217;s a letter for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">From whence, fragment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Who keeps the tent now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">The surgeon&#8217;s box, or the patient&#8217;s
wound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, adversity! and what need these
tricks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy
talk:
thou art thought to be Achilles&#8217; male varlet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Male varlet, you rogue! what&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten
diseases
of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
loads o&#8217; gravel i&#8217; the back, lethargies, cold
palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
limekilns i&#8217; the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
again such preposterous discoveries!</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what
meanest
thou to curse thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Do I curse thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
indistinguishable cur, no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal&#8217;s
purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!</p>
<p class="speaker">Patroclus</p>
<p class="speech">Out, gall!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Finch-egg!</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite<br>
From my great purpose in to-morrow&#8217;s battle.<br>
Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,<br>
A token from her daughter, my fair love,<br>
Both taxing me and gaging me to keep<br>
An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:<br>
Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;<br>
My major vow lies here, this I&#8217;ll obey.<br>
Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:<br>
This night in banqueting must all be spent.<br>
Away, Patroclus!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Achilles and
Patroclus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">With too much blood and too little brain, these
two
may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
little blood they do, I&#8217;ll be a curer of madmen.
Here&#8217;s Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
there, his brother, the bull,&#8212;the primitive statue,
and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother&#8217;s
leg,&#8212;to what form but that he is, should wit larded
with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
spirits and fires!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hector, Troilus, Ajax,
Agamemnon, Ulysses, Nestor, Menelaus, and Diomedes, with
lights</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">We go wrong, we go wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">No, yonder &#8217;tis;<br>
There, where we see the lights.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">I trouble you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ajax</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a whit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Here comes himself to guide
you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Achilles</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good
night.<br>
Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks and good night to the Greeks&#8217;
general.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menelaus</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet draught: &#8216;sweet&#8217; quoth
&#8217;a! sweet sink,
sweet sewer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Good night and welcome, both at once, to
those<br>
That go or tarry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agamemnon</p>
<p class="speech">Good night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Agamemnon and
Menelaus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,<br>
Keep Hector company an hour or two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot, lord; I have important business,<br>
The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Troilus]</span>
Follow his torch; he goes to<br>
Calchas&#8217; tent:<br>
I&#8217;ll keep you company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet sir, you honour me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">And so, good night.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Diomedes; Ulysses and
Troilus following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, enter my tent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Achilles, Hector,
Ajax, and Nestor</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">That same Diomed&#8217;s a false-hearted rogue, a
most
unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
drab, and uses the traitor Calchas&#8217; tent: I&#8217;ll
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!</p>

<p class="speech">Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with
you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Whispers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, so familiar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">She will sing any man at first sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">And any man may sing her, if he can take her
cliff;
she&#8217;s noted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Will you remember?</p>

<p class="speech">Remember! yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but do, then;<br>
And let your mind be coupled with your words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">What should she remember?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">List.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Roguery!</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I cannot: what would you have me
do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">A juggling trick,&#8212;to be secretly open.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">What did you swear you would bestow on me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>

<p class="speech">Thy better must.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, one word in your ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O plague and madness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray
you,<br>
Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself<br>
To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;<br>
The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Behold, I pray you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good my lord, go off:<br>
You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You have not patience; come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell&#8217;s
torments<br>
I will not speak a word!</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>

<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but you part in anger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Doth that grieve thee?<br>
O wither&#8217;d truth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, how now, lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">By Jove,<br>
I will be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Guardian!&#8212;why, Greek!</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I do not: come hither once again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">You shake, my lord, at something: will you
go?<br>
You will break out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">She strokes his cheek!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:<br>
There is between my will and all offences<br>
A guard of patience: stay a little while.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!</p>

<p class="speech">But will you, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Give me some token for the surety of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll fetch you one.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">You have sworn patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Fear me not, sweet lord;<br>
I will not be myself, nor have cognition<br>
Of what I feel: I am all patience.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Cressida</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Now the pledge; now, now, now!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">O beauty! where is thy faith?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I will be patient; outwardly I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.<br>
He loved me&#8212;O false wench!&#8212;Give&#8217;t me again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Whose was&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">It is no matter, now I have&#8217;t again.<br>
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:<br>
I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">I shall have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What, this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!<br>
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed<br>
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,<br>
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,<br>
As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;<br>
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">I had your heart before, this follows it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">I did swear patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall
not;<br>
I&#8217;ll give you something else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">I will have this: whose was it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">It is no matter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Come, tell me whose it was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas one&#8217;s that loved me better than
you will.<br>
But, now you have it, take it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Whose was it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">By all Diana&#8217;s waiting-women yond,<br>
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,<br>
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy
horn,<br>
It should be challenged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, &#8217;tis done, &#8217;tis past: and
yet it is not;<br>
I will not keep my word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, farewell;<br>
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,<br>
But it straight starts you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">I do not like this fooling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you
pleases me best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall I come? the hour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, come:&#8212;O Jove!&#8212;do come:&#8212;I
shall be plagued.</p>
<p class="speaker">Diomedes</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell till then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cressida</p>
<p class="speech">Good night: I prithee, come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Diomedes</span></p>
<p class="speech">Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee<br>
But with my heart the other eye doth see.<br>
Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,<br>
The error of our eye directs our mind:<br>
What error leads must err; O, then conclude<br>
Minds sway&#8217;d by eyes are full of turpitude.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">A proof of strength she could not publish
more,<br>
Unless she said &#8216;My mind is now turn&#8217;d
whore.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">All&#8217;s done, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">It is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Why stay we, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">To make a recordation to my soul<br>
Of every syllable that here was spoke.<br>
But if I tell how these two did co-act,<br>
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?<br>
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,<br>
An esperance so obstinately strong,<br>
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,<br>
As if those organs had deceptious functions,<br>
Created only to calumniate.<br>
Was Cressid here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot conjure, Trojan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">She was not, sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Most sure she was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Let it not be believed for womanhood!<br>
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage<br>
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,<br>
For depravation, to square the general sex<br>
By Cressid&#8217;s rule: rather think this not Cressid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ulysses</p>
<p class="speech">What hath she done, prince, that can soil our
mothers?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at all, unless that this were she.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thersites</p>
<p class="speech">Will he swagger himself out on&#8217;s own
eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">This she? no, this is Diomed&#8217;s
Cressida:<br>
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;<br>
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,<br>
If sanctimony be the gods&#8217; delight,<br>
If there be rule in unity itself,<br>
This is not she. O madness of discourse,<br>
That cause sets up with and against itself!<br>
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt<br>
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason<br>
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.<br>
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight<br>
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate<br>
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,<br>
And yet the spacious breadth of this division<br>
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle<br>
As Ariachne&#8217;s broken woof to enter.<br>

So much by weight hate I her Diomed:<br>
That sleeve is mine that he&#8217;ll bear on his helm;<br>
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan&#8217;s skill,<br>
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout<br>

his shield behind him</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Achilles and
Myrmidons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;<br>
How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:<br>
Even with the vail and darking of the sun,<br>
To close the day up, Hector&#8217;s life is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hector</p>
<p class="speech">I am unarm&#8217;d; forego this vantage,
Greek.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I
seek.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hector falls</span></p>
<p class="speech">So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink
down!<br>
Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.<br>
On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,<br>
&#8216;Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A retreat sounded</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Myrmidons</p>
<p class="speech">The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Achilles</p>
<p class="speech">The dragon wing of night o&#8217;erspreads the
earth,<br>
And, stickler-like, the armies separates.<br>
My half-supp&#8217;d sword, that frankly would have fed,<br>
Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sheathes his sword</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, tie his body to my horse&#8217;s tail;<br>
Along the field I will the Trojan trail.</p>

Menelaus, Nestor, Diomedes, and others, marching. Shouts
within</span></p>

Achilles.</p>

Achilles.</p>

<p class="speech">If it be so, yet bragless let it be;<br>
Great Hector was a man as good as he.</p>

Never go home; here starve we out the night.</p>

<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>

<p class="speech">He&#8217;s dead; and at the murderer&#8217;s
horse&#8217;s tail,<br>
In beastly sort, dragg&#8217;d through the shameful field.<br>
Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!<br>
Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!<br>
I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,<br>
And linger not our sure destructions on!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aeneas</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you do discomfort all the host!</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">You understand me not that tell me so:<br>
I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,<br>
But dare all imminence that gods and men<br>
Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:<br>
Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?<br>
Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call&#8217;d,<br>
Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector&#8217;s dead:<br>
There is a word will Priam turn to stone;<br>
Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,<br>
Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,<br>
Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:<br>
Hector is dead; there is no more to say.<br>
Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,<br>
Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,<br>
Let Titan rise as early as he dare,<br>
I&#8217;ll through and through you! and, thou great-sized
coward,<br>
No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:<br>
I&#8217;ll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,<br>
That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy&#8217;s thoughts.<br>
Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:<br>
Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Aeneas and
Trojans</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">As Troilus is going out,
enter, from the other side, Pandarus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">But hear you, hear you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Troilus</p>
<p class="speech">Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame<br>
Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pandarus</p>
<p class="speech">A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O
world!
world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:<br>
Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,<br>
Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;<br>
And being once subdued in armed tail,<br>
Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.<br>
Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
painted cloths.<br>
As many as be here of pander&#8217;s hall,<br>
Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar&#8217;s fall;<br>
Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,<br>
Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.<br>
Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,<br>
Some two months hence my will shall here be made:<br>
It should be now, but that my fear is this,<br>
Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:<br>
Till then I&#8217;ll sweat and seek about for eases,<br>
And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.</p>
