<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p class="speech">Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
A pair of star-cross&#8217;d lovers take their life;<br>
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
Do with their death bury their parents&#8217; strife.<br>
The fearful passage of their death-mark&#8217;d love,<br>
And the continuance of their parents&#8217; rage,<br>
Which, but their children&#8217;s end, nought could remove,<br>
Is now the two hours&#8217; traffic of our stage;<br>
The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.</p>

<h4>Scene I. Verona. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sampson and Gregory, of
the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Gregory, o&#8217; my word, we&#8217;ll not carry
coals.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I mean, an we be in choler, we&#8217;ll draw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o&#8217;
the collar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I strike quickly, being moved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">But thou art not quickly moved to strike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">A dog of the house of Montague moves me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to
stand:
therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn&#8217;st away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I
will
take the wall of any man or maid of Montague&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest
goes
to the wall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">True; and therefore women, being the weaker
vessels,
are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
Montague&#8217;s men from the wall, and thrust his maids
to the wall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">The quarrel is between our masters and us their
men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant:
when I
have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
maids, and cut off their heads.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">The heads of the maids?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the heads of the maids, or their
maidenheads;
take it in what sense thou wilt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">They must take it in sense that feel it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Me they shall feel while I am able to stand:
and<br>
&#8217;tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst,
thou
hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
two of the house of the Montagues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">How! turn thy back and run?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Fear me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No, marry; I fear thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Let us take the law of our sides; let them
begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it
as
they list.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at
them;
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Abraham and
Balthasar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">I do bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gregory]</span> Is
the law of our side, if I say
ay?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but
I
bite my thumb, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Do you quarrel, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">Quarrel sir! no, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a
man as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">No better.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gregory</p>
<p class="speech">Say &#8216;better:&#8217; here comes one of my
master&#8217;s kinsmen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, better, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Abraham</p>
<p class="speech">You lie.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sampson</p>
<p class="speech">Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy
swashing blow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Part, fools!<br>
Put up your swords; you know not what you do.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats down their
swords</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tybalt</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou drawn among these heartless
hinds?<br>
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,<br>
Or manage it to part these men with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the
word,<br>
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:<br>
Have at thee, coward!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, several of both
houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with
clubs</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them
down!<br>
Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Capulet in his gown,
and Lady Capulet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">What noise is this? Give me my long sword,
ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,<br>
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Montague and Lady
Montague</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Thou villain Capulet,&#8212;Hold me not, let me
go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince, with
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,<br>
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,&#8212;<br>
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,<br>
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage<br>
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,<br>
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands<br>
Throw your mistemper&#8217;d weapons to the ground,<br>
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.<br>
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,<br>
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,<br>
Have thrice disturb&#8217;d the quiet of our streets,<br>
And made Verona&#8217;s ancient citizens<br>
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,<br>
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,<br>
Canker&#8217;d with peace, to part your canker&#8217;d hate:<br>
If ever you disturb our streets again,<br>
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.<br>
For this time, all the rest depart away:<br>
You Capulet; shall go along with me:<br>
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,<br>
To know our further pleasure in this case,<br>
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.<br>
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Montague, Lady
Montague, and Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?<br>
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Here were the servants of your adversary,<br>
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:<br>
I drew to part them: in the instant came<br>
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,<br>
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,<br>
He swung about his head and cut the winds,<br>
Who nothing hurt withal hiss&#8217;d him in scorn:<br>
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,<br>
Came more and more and fought on part and part,<br>
Till the prince came, who parted either part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Montague</p>
<p class="speech">O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?<br>
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, an hour before the worshipp&#8217;d
sun<br>
Peer&#8217;d forth the golden window of the east,<br>
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;<br>
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore<br>
That westward rooteth from the city&#8217;s side,<br>
So early walking did I see your son:<br>
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me<br>
And stole into the covert of the wood:<br>
I, measuring his affections by my own,<br>
That most are busied when they&#8217;re most alone,<br>
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,<br>
And gladly shunn&#8217;d who gladly fled from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Many a morning hath he there been seen,<br>
With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.<br>
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;<br>
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun<br>
Should in the furthest east begin to draw<br>
The shady curtains from Aurora&#8217;s bed,<br>
Away from the light steals home my heavy son,<br>
And private in his chamber pens himself,<br>
Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out<br>
And makes himself an artificial night:<br>
Black and portentous must this humour prove,<br>
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">My noble uncle, do you know the cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">I neither know it nor can learn of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Have you importuned him by any means?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Both by myself and many other friends:<br>
But he, his own affections&#8217; counsellor,<br>
Is to himself&#8212;I will not say how true&#8212;<br>
But to himself so secret and so close,<br>
So far from sounding and discovery,<br>
As is the bud bit with an envious worm,<br>
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,<br>
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.<br>
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.<br>
We would as willingly give cure as know.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">See, where he comes: so please you, step
aside;<br>
I&#8217;ll know his grievance, or be much denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,<br>
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let&#8217;s away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Montague and Lady
Montague</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Good-morrow, cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is the day so young?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">But new struck nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! sad hours seem long.<br>
Was that my father that went hence so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo&#8217;s
hours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Not having that, which, having, makes them
short.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">In love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Out&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Of love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Out of her favour, where I am in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,<br>
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,<br>
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!<br>
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?<br>
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.<br>
Here&#8217;s much to do with hate, but more with love.<br>
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!<br>
O any thing, of nothing first create!<br>
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!<br>
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!<br>
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!<br>
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!<br>
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.<br>
Dost thou not laugh?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">No, coz, I rather weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good heart, at what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">At thy good heart&#8217;s oppression.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Why, such is love&#8217;s transgression.<br>
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,<br>
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest<br>
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown<br>
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.<br>
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;<br>
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers&#8217; eyes;<br>
Being vex&#8217;d a sea nourish&#8217;d with lovers&#8217;
tears:<br>
What is it else? a madness most discreet,<br>
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.<br>
Farewell, my coz.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Soft! I will go along;<br>
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;<br>
This is not Romeo, he&#8217;s some other where.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall I groan and tell thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Groan! why, no.<br>
But sadly tell me who.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:<br>
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!<br>
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I aim&#8217;d so near, when I supposed you
loved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A right good mark-man! And she&#8217;s fair I
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, in that hit you miss: she&#8217;ll not be
hit<br>
With Cupid&#8217;s arrow; she hath Dian&#8217;s wit;<br>
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm&#8217;d,<br>
From love&#8217;s weak childish bow she lives unharm&#8217;d.<br>
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,<br>
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,<br>
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:<br>
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,<br>
That when she dies with beauty dies her store.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Then she hath sworn that she will still live
chaste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">She hath, and in that sparing makes huge
waste,<br>
For beauty starved with her severity<br>
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.<br>
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,<br>
To merit bliss by making me despair:<br>
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow<br>
Do I live dead that live to tell it now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>

These happy masks that kiss fair ladies&#8217; brows<br>

The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:<br>
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,<br>
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note<br>

My child is yet a stranger in the world;<br>

She is the hopeful lady of my earth:<br>
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,<br>
My will to her consent is but a part;<br>
An she agree, within her scope of choice<br>
Lies my consent and fair according voice.<br>
This night I hold an old accustom&#8217;d feast,<br>
Whereto I have invited many a guest,<br>
Such as I love; and you, among the store,<br>
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.<br>
At my poor house look to behold this night<br>
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:<br>
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel<br>
When well-apparell&#8217;d April on the heel<br>
Of limping winter treads, even such delight<br>
Among fresh female buds shall you this night<br>
Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,<br>
And like her most whose merit most shall be:<br>

I have remember&#8217;d me, thou&#8217;s hear our counsel.<br>
Thou know&#8217;st my daughter&#8217;s of a pretty age.</p>

She is not fourteen. How long is it now<br>

Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.<br>
Susan and she&#8212;God rest all Christian souls!&#8212;<br>
Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;<br>
She was too good for me: but, as I said,<br>
On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;<br>
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.<br>
&#8217;Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;<br>
And she was wean&#8217;d,&#8212;I never shall forget it,&#8212;<br>
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:<br>
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,<br>
Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;<br>
My lord and you were then at Mantua:&#8212;<br>
Nay, I do bear a brain:&#8212;but, as I said,<br>
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple<br>
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,<br>
To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!<br>
Shake quoth the dove-house: &#8217;twas no need, I trow,<br>
To bid me trudge:<br>
And since that time it is eleven years;<br>
For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,<br>
She could have run and waddled all about;<br>
For even the day before, she broke her brow:<br>
And then my husband&#8212;God be with his soul!<br>
A&#8217; was a merry man&#8212;took up the child:<br>
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; quoth he, &#8216;dost thou fall upon thy
face?<br>
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; and, by my holidame,<br>
The pretty wretch left crying and said &#8216;Ay.&#8217;<br>
To see, now, how a jest shall come about!<br>
I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,<br>
I never should forget it: &#8216;Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; quoth
he;<br>
And, pretty fool, it stinted and said &#8216;Ay.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,<br>
To think it should leave crying and say &#8216;Ay.&#8217;<br>
And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow<br>
A bump as big as a young cockerel&#8217;s stone;<br>
A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:<br>
&#8216;Yea,&#8217; quoth my husband,&#8217;fall&#8217;st upon thy

Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;<br>
Wilt thou not, Jule?&#8217; it stinted and said

Thou wast the prettiest babe that e&#8217;er I nursed:<br>
An I might live to see thee married once,<br>
I have my wish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that &#8216;marry&#8217; is the very

How stands your disposition to be married?</p>

I would say thou hadst suck&#8217;d wisdom from thy teat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, think of marriage now; younger than
you,<br>
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,<br>
Are made already mothers: by my count,<br>
I was your mother much upon these years<br>
That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:<br>
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">A man, young lady! lady, such a man<br>
As all the world&#8212;why, he&#8217;s a man of wax.</p>

This night you shall behold him at our feast;<br>

And find delight writ there with beauty&#8217;s pen;<br>
Examine every married lineament,<br>
And see how one another lends content<br>
And what obscured in this fair volume lies<br>
Find written in the margent of his eyes.<br>
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,<br>
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:<br>
The fish lives in the sea, and &#8217;tis much pride<br>
For fair without the fair within to hide:<br>
That book in many&#8217;s eyes doth share the glory,<br>
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;<br>
So shall you share all that he doth possess,<br>
By having him, making yourself no less.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.</p>

Or shall we on without a apology?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">The date is out of such prolixity:<br>
We&#8217;ll have no Cupid hoodwink&#8217;d with a scarf,<br>
Bearing a Tartar&#8217;s painted bow of lath,<br>
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;<br>
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke<br>
After the prompter, for our entrance:<br>
But let them measure us by what they will;<br>
We&#8217;ll measure them a measure, and be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>

With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead<br>
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">You are a lover; borrow Cupid&#8217;s wings,<br>
And soar with them above a common bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I am too sore enpierced with his shaft<br>
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,<br>
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:<br>
Under love&#8217;s heavy burden do I sink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">And, to sink in it, should you burden love;<br>
Too great oppression for a tender thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,<br>
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">If love be rough with you, be rough with
love;<br>
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.<br>
Give me a case to put my visage in:<br>
A visor for a visor! what care I<br>
What curious eye doth quote deformities?<br>
Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.</p>

But every man betake him to his legs.</p>

Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,<br>
For I am proverb&#8217;d with a grandsire phrase;<br>

Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!</p>

Five times in that ere once in our five wits.</p>

<p class="speech">In bed asleep, while they do dream things
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.<br>
She is the fairies&#8217; midwife, and she comes<br>
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone<br>
On the fore-finger of an alderman,<br>
Drawn with a team of little atomies<br>
Athwart men&#8217;s noses as they lie asleep;<br>
Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders&#8217; legs,<br>
The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,<br>
The traces of the smallest spider&#8217;s web,<br>
The collars of the moonshine&#8217;s watery beams,<br>
Her whip of cricket&#8217;s bone, the lash of film,<br>
Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,<br>
Not so big as a round little worm<br>
Prick&#8217;d from the lazy finger of a maid;<br>
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut<br>
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,<br>
Time out o&#8217; mind the fairies&#8217; coachmakers.<br>
And in this state she gallops night by night<br>
Through lovers&#8217; brains, and then they dream of love;<br>
O&#8217;er courtiers&#8217; knees, that dream on court&#8217;sies
straight,<br>
O&#8217;er lawyers&#8217; fingers, who straight dream on fees,<br>
O&#8217;er ladies&#8217; lips, who straight on kisses dream,<br>
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,<br>
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:<br>
Sometime she gallops o&#8217;er a courtier&#8217;s nose,<br>
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;<br>
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig&#8217;s tail<br>
Tickling a parson&#8217;s nose as a&#8217; lies asleep,<br>
Then dreams, he of another benefice:<br>
Sometime she driveth o&#8217;er a soldier&#8217;s neck,<br>
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,<br>
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,<br>
Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon<br>
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,<br>
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two<br>
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab<br>
That plats the manes of horses in the night,<br>
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,<br>
Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:<br>
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,<br>
That presses them and learns them first to bear,<br>
Making them women of good carriage:<br>
This is she&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!<br>
Thou talk&#8217;st of nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">True, I talk of dreams,<br>
Which are the children of an idle brain,<br>
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,<br>
Which is as thin of substance as the air<br>
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes<br>
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,<br>
And, being anger&#8217;d, puffs away from thence,<br>
Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">This wind, you talk of, blows us from
ourselves;<br>
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I fear, too early: for my mind misgives<br>
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars<br>
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date<br>
With this night&#8217;s revels and expire the term<br>
Of a despised life closed in my breast<br>
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.<br>
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,<br>
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.</p>

The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.<br>
I conjure thee by Rosaline&#8217;s bright eyes,<br>

What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!<br>
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say &#8216;Ay,&#8217;<br>
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear&#8217;st,<br>
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers&#8217; perjuries<br>
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,<br>
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:<br>
Or if thou think&#8217;st I am too quickly won,<br>

So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.<br>
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,<br>
And therefore thou mayst think my &#8217;havior light:<br>
But trust me, gentleman, I&#8217;ll prove more true<br>
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.<br>
I should have been more strange, I must confess,<br>
But that thou overheard&#8217;st, ere I was ware,<br>

If that thy bent of love be honourable,<br>
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,<br>
By one that I&#8217;ll procure to come to thee,<br>
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;<br>
And all my fortunes at thy foot I&#8217;ll lay<br>
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>

I do beseech thee&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">By and by, I come:&#8212;<br>
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:<br>
To-morrow will I send.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>

voice,<br>
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!<br>
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;<br>
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,<br>
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,<br>
With repetition of my Romeo&#8217;s name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">It is my soul that calls upon my name:<br>
How silver-sweet sound lovers&#8217; tongues by night,<br>

Shall I send to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">At the hour of nine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I will not fail: &#8217;tis twenty years till
then.<br>
I have forgot why I did call thee back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Let me stand here till thou remember it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I shall forget, to have thee still stand
there,<br>
Remembering how I love thy company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And I&#8217;ll still stay, to have thee still
forget,<br>
Forgetting any other home but this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis almost morning; I would have thee
gone:<br>
And yet no further than a wanton&#8217;s bird;<br>
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,<br>
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,<br>
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,<br>
So loving-jealous of his liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were thy bird.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet, so would I:<br>
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.<br>
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,<br>
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy
breast!<br>
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!<br>
Hence will I to my ghostly father&#8217;s cell,<br>
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning
night,<br>
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,<br>
And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels<br>
From forth day&#8217;s path and Titan&#8217;s fiery wheels:<br>
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,<br>
The day to cheer and night&#8217;s dank dew to dry,<br>
I must up-fill this osier cage of ours<br>
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.<br>
The earth that&#8217;s nature&#8217;s mother is her tomb;<br>
What is her burying grave that is her womb,<br>
And from her womb children of divers kind<br>
We sucking on her natural bosom find,<br>
Many for many virtues excellent,<br>
None but for some and yet all different.<br>
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies<br>
In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:<br>
For nought so vile that on the earth doth live<br>
But to the earth some special good doth give,<br>
Nor aught so good but strain&#8217;d from that fair use<br>
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:<br>
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;<br>
And vice sometimes by action dignified.<br>
Within the infant rind of this small flower<br>
Poison hath residence and medicine power:<br>
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;<br>
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.<br>
Two such opposed kings encamp them still<br>
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;<br>
And where the worser is predominant,<br>
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Benedicite!<br>
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?<br>
Young son, it argues a distemper&#8217;d head<br>
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:<br>
Care keeps his watch in every old man&#8217;s eye,<br>
And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;<br>
But where unbruised youth with unstuff&#8217;d brain<br>
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:<br>
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure<br>
Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;<br>
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,<br>
Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;<br>
I have forgot that name, and that name&#8217;s woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s my good son: but where hast thou
been, then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell thee, ere thou ask it me
again.<br>
I have been feasting with mine enemy,<br>
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,<br>
That&#8217;s by me wounded: both our remedies<br>
Within thy help and holy physic lies:<br>
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,<br>
My intercession likewise steads my foe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;<br>
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Then plainly know my heart&#8217;s dear love is
set<br>
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:<br>
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;<br>
And all combined, save what thou must combine<br>
By holy marriage: when and where and how<br>
We met, we woo&#8217;d and made exchange of vow,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,<br>
That thou consent to marry us to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!<br>
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,<br>
So soon forsaken? young men&#8217;s love then lies<br>
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.<br>
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine<br>
Hath wash&#8217;d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!<br>
How much salt water thrown away in waste,<br>
To season love, that of it doth not taste!<br>
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,<br>
Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;<br>
Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit<br>
Of an old tear that is not wash&#8217;d off yet:<br>
If e&#8217;er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,<br>
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:<br>
And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,<br>
Women may fall, when there&#8217;s no strength in men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou chid&#8217;st me oft for loving
Rosaline.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And bad&#8217;st me bury love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Not in a grave,<br>
To lay one in, another out to have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now<br>
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;<br>
The other did not so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">O, she knew well<br>
Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.<br>
But come, young waverer, come, go with me,<br>
In one respect I&#8217;ll thy assistant be;<br>
For this alliance may so happy prove,<br>
To turn your households&#8217; rancour to pure love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Where the devil should this Romeo be?<br>
Came he not home to-night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Not to his father&#8217;s; I spoke with his
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that
Rosaline.<br>
Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,<br>
Hath sent a letter to his father&#8217;s house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">A challenge, on my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo will answer it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Any man that can write may answer a letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he will answer the letter&#8217;s master,
how he
dares, being dared.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with
a
white wench&#8217;s black eye; shot through the ear with a
love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
blind bow-boy&#8217;s butt-shaft: and is he a man to
encounter Tybalt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what is Tybalt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he
is
the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
very first house, of the first and second cause:
ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
hai!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">The what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! &#8216;By Jesu,
a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
whore!&#8217; Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
perdona-mi&#8217;s, who stand so much on the new form,
that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
bones, their bones!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh,
flesh,
how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bon jour! there&#8217;s a French salutation
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I
give you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">The ship, sir, the slip; can you not
conceive?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and
in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as much as to say, such a case as
yours
constrains a man to bow in the hams.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Meaning, to court&#8217;sy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast most kindly hit it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A most courteous exposition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Pink for flower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then is my pump well flowered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Well said: follow me this jest now till thou
hast
worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits
faint.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I&#8217;ll
cry a match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I
have
done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
was I with you there for the goose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou
wast
not there for the goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good goose, bite not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a
most
sharp sauce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And is it not well served in to a sweet
goose?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O here&#8217;s a wit of cheveril, that stretches
from an
inch narrow to an ell broad!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I stretch it out for that word
&#8216;broad;&#8217; which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, is not this better now than groaning for
love?
now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Stop there, stop there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the
hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou art deceived; I would have made it
short:
for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.</p>

quoth a&#8217;? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
may find the young Romeo?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older
when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">You say well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i&#8217;
faith;
wisely, wisely.</p>

you.</p>

<p class="speech">A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What hast thou found?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten
pie,
that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">An old hare hoar,<br>
And an old hare hoar,<br>
&emsp;Is very good meat in lent<br>
But a hare that is hoar<br>

&emsp;When it hoars ere it be spent.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself
talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">An a&#8217; speak any thing against me,
I&#8217;ll take him
down, an a&#8217; were lustier than he is, and twenty such
Jacks; and if I cannot, I&#8217;ll find those that shall.
Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my
weapon
should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
good quarrel, and the law on my side.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part
about
me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
a fool&#8217;s paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Good heart, and, i&#8217; faith, I will tell her
as much:<br>
Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not
mark me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which,
as<br>
I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Bid her devise<br>
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;<br>
And there she shall at Friar Laurence&#8217; cell<br>
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">No truly sir; not a penny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Go to; I say you shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be
there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:<br>
Within this hour my man shall be with thee<br>
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;<br>
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy<br>
Must be my convoy in the secret night.<br>
Farewell; be trusty, and I&#8217;ll quit thy pains:<br>
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, my dear nurse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Is your man secret? Did you ne&#8217;er hear
say,<br>
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant thee, my man&#8217;s as true as
steel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest
lady&#8212;Lord,
Lord! when &#8217;twas a little prating thing:&#8212;O, there
is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain

see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
man; but, I&#8217;ll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?</p>

it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good

In half an hour she promised to return.<br>
Perchance she cannot meet him: that&#8217;s not so.<br>
O, she is lame! love&#8217;s heralds should be thoughts,<br>
Which ten times faster glide than the sun&#8217;s beams,<br>
Driving back shadows over louring hills:<br>
Therefore do nimble-pinion&#8217;d doves draw love,<br>
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.<br>
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill<br>
Of this day&#8217;s journey, and from nine till twelve<br>
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.<br>
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,<br>
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;<br>
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,<br>
And his to me:<br>
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;<br>
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.<br>
O God, she comes!</p>

Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;<br>
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news<br>
By playing it to me with so sour a face.</p>

Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!</p>

Do you not see that I am out of breath?</p>

<p class="speech">How art thou out of breath, when thou hast
breath<br>
To say to me that thou art out of breath?<br>
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay<br>
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.<br>
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;<br>
Say either, and I&#8217;ll stay the circumstance:<br>
Let me be satisfied, is&#8217;t good or bad?</p>

<p class="speech">Well, you have made a simple choice; you know
not
how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
face be better than any man&#8217;s, yet his leg excels
all men&#8217;s; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
but, I&#8217;ll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?</p>

<p class="speech">No, no: but all this did I know before.<br>
What says he of our marriage? what of that?</p>

It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.<br>
My back o&#8217; t&#8217; other side,&#8212;O, my back, my

There stays a husband to make you a wife:<br>
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,<br>
They&#8217;ll be in scarlet straight at any news.<br>
Hie you to church; I must another way,<br>
To fetch a ladder, by the which your love<br>
Must climb a bird&#8217;s nest soon when it is dark:<br>
I am the drudge and toil in your delight,<br>

Then love-devouring death do what he dare;<br>
It is enough I may but call her mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>

And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,<br>
Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey<br>

Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;<br>

Be heap&#8217;d like mine and that thy skill be more<br>
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath<br>
This neighbour air, and let rich music&#8217;s tongue<br>

I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.</p>

And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;<br>
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</p>

he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says &#8216;God send me no need of
thee!&#8217; and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, an there were two such, we should have
none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</p>

<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&#8217;s hand did
slay;<br>
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink<br>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br>
Your high displeasure: all this uttered<br>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow&#8217;d,<br>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&#8217;s breast,<br>
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,<br>
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,<br>
&#8216;Hold, friends! friends, part!&#8217; and, swifter than
his tongue,<br>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>
And &#8217;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<br>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br>
Who had but newly entertain&#8217;d revenge,<br>
And to &#8217;t they go like lightning, for, ere I<br>
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.<br>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">He is a kinsman to the Montague;<br>
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:<br>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br>
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;<br>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;<br>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio&#8217;s
friend;<br>
His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br>
The life of Tybalt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">And for that offence<br>
Immediately we do exile him hence:<br>
I have an interest in your hate&#8217;s proceeding,<br>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;<br>
But I&#8217;ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:<br>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:<br>
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,<br>
Else, when he&#8217;s found, that hour is his last.<br>
Bear hence this body and attend our will:<br>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</p>

Play&#8217;d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:<br>
Hood my unmann&#8217;d blood, bating in my cheeks,<br>
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,<br>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br>
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br>
Whiter than new snow on a raven&#8217;s back.<br>
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow&#8217;d night,<br>
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,<br>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br>
That all the world will be in love with night<br>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<br>
But not possess&#8217;d it, and, though I am sold,<br>
Not yet enjoy&#8217;d: so tedious is this day<br>
As is the night before some festival<br>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<br>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<br>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<br>
But Romeo&#8217;s name speaks heavenly eloquence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Nurse, with
cords</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the
cords<br>
That Romeo bid thee fetch?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, the cords.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throws them down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy
hands?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, well-a-day! he&#8217;s dead, he&#8217;s dead,
he&#8217;s dead!<br>
We are undone, lady, we are undone!<br>
Alack the day! he&#8217;s gone, he&#8217;s kill&#8217;d, he&#8217;s
dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Can heaven be so envious?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo can,<br>
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!<br>
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What devil art thou, that dost torment me
thus?<br>
This torture should be roar&#8217;d in dismal hell.<br>
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but &#8216;I,&#8217;<br>
And that bare vowel &#8216;I&#8217; shall poison more<br>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:<br>
I am not I, if there be such an I;<br>
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer &#8216;I.&#8217;<br>
If he be slain, say &#8216;I&#8217;; or if not, no:<br>
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I saw the wound, I saw it with mine
eyes,&#8212;<br>
God save the mark!&#8212;here on his manly breast:<br>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<br>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub&#8217;d in blood,<br>
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at
once!<br>
To prison, eyes, ne&#8217;er look on liberty!<br>
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;<br>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<br>
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!<br>
That ever I should live to see thee dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br>
Is Romeo slaughter&#8217;d, and is Tybalt dead?<br>
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?<br>
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!<br>
For who is living, if those two are gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;<br>
Romeo that kill&#8217;d him, he is banished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O God! did Romeo&#8217;s hand shed Tybalt&#8217;s
blood?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">It did, it did; alas the day, it did!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!<br>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br>
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!<br>
Dove-feather&#8217;d raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!<br>
Despised substance of divinest show!<br>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem&#8217;st,<br>
A damned saint, an honourable villain!<br>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,<br>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br>
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?<br>
Was ever book containing such vile matter<br>
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell<br>
In such a gorgeous palace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no trust,<br>
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,<br>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br>
Ah, where&#8217;s my man? give me some aqua vitae:<br>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<br>
Shame come to Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Blister&#8217;d be thy tongue<br>
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:<br>
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;<br>
For &#8217;tis a throne where honour may be crown&#8217;d<br>
Sole monarch of the universal earth.<br>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Will you speak well of him that kill&#8217;d your
cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,<br>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br>
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br>
That villain cousin would have kill&#8217;d my husband:<br>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;<br>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<br>
And Tybalt&#8217;s dead, that would have slain my husband:<br>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt&#8217;s death,<br>
That murder&#8217;d me: I would forget it fain;<br>
But, O, it presses to my memory,<br>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners&#8217; minds:<br>
&#8216;Tybalt is dead, and Romeo&#8212;banished;&#8217;<br>
That &#8216;banished,&#8217; that one word
&#8216;banished,&#8217;<br>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt&#8217;s death<br>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:<br>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br>
And needly will be rank&#8217;d with other griefs,<br>
Why follow&#8217;d not, when she said &#8216;Tybalt&#8217;s
dead,&#8217;<br>
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br>
Which modern lamentations might have moved?<br>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt&#8217;s death,<br>
&#8216;Romeo is banished,&#8217; to speak that word,<br>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br>
All slain, all dead. &#8216;Romeo is banished!&#8217;<br>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br>
In that word&#8217;s death; no words can that woe sound.<br>
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Weeping and wailing over Tybalt&#8217;s
corse:<br>
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be
spent,<br>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo&#8217;s banishment.<br>
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,<br>
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:<br>
He made you for a highway to my bed;<br>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br>
Come, cords, come, nurse; I&#8217;ll to my wedding-bed;<br>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Hie to your chamber: I&#8217;ll find Romeo<br>
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.<br>
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:<br>
I&#8217;ll to him; he is hid at Laurence&#8217; cell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, find him! give this ring to my true

<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>

Affliction is enamour&#8217;d of thy parts,<br>
And thou art wedded to calamity.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Father, what news? what is the prince&#8217;s
doom?<br>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,<br>
That I yet know not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Too familiar<br>
Is my dear son with such sour company:<br>
I bring thee tidings of the prince&#8217;s doom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What less than dooms-day is the prince&#8217;s
doom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">A gentler judgment vanish&#8217;d from his
lips,<br>
Not body&#8217;s death, but body&#8217;s banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, banishment! be merciful, say
&#8216;death;&#8217;<br>
For exile hath more terror in his look,<br>
Much more than death: do not say &#8216;banishment.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hence from Verona art thou banished:<br>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">There is no world without Verona walls,<br>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>
Hence-banished is banish&#8217;d from the world,<br>
And world&#8217;s exile is death: then banished,<br>
Is death mis-term&#8217;d: calling death banishment,<br>
Thou cutt&#8217;st my head off with a golden axe,<br>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!<br>
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,<br>
Taking thy part, hath rush&#8217;d aside the law,<br>
And turn&#8217;d that black word death to banishment:<br>
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is
here,<br>
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<br>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>
Live here in heaven and may look on her;<br>
But Romeo may not: more validity,<br>
More honourable state, more courtship lives<br>
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize<br>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet&#8217;s hand<br>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,<br>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>
But Romeo may not; he is banished:<br>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:<br>
They are free men, but I am banished.<br>
And say&#8217;st thou yet that exile is not death?<br>
Hadst thou no poison mix&#8217;d, no sharp-ground knife,<br>
No sudden mean of death, though ne&#8217;er so mean,<br>
But &#8216;banished&#8217; to kill
me?&#8212;&#8217;banished&#8217;?<br>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<br>
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,<br>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess&#8217;d,<br>
To mangle me with that word &#8216;banished&#8217;?</p>

<p class="speech">O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>

Adversity&#8217;s sweet milk, philosophy,<br>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Yet &#8216;banished&#8217;? Hang up
philosophy!<br>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br>
Displant a town, reverse a prince&#8217;s doom,<br>
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.</p>

An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br>
Doting like me and like me banished,<br>

Just in her case! O woful sympathy!<br>
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,<br>

Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:<br>
For Juliet&#8217;s sake, for her sake, rise and stand;<br>
Why should you fall into so deep an O?</p>

<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?<br>
Doth she not think me an old murderer,<br>
Now I have stain&#8217;d the childhood of our joy<br>
With blood removed but little from her own?<br>
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says<br>
My conceal&#8217;d lady to our cancell&#8217;d love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and
weeps;<br>
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,<br>

And then down falls again.</p>

Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br>
Did murder her; as that name&#8217;s cursed hand<br>
Murder&#8217;d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br>

Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:<br>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<br>
The unreasonable fury of a beast:<br>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<br>
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,<br>
I thought thy disposition better temper&#8217;d.<br>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?<br>
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,<br>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br>
Why rail&#8217;st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<br>
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet<br>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;<br>
Which, like a usurer, abound&#8217;st in all,<br>
And usest none in that true use indeed<br>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:<br>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br>
Digressing from the valour of a man;<br>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>
Killing that love which thou hast vow&#8217;d to cherish;<br>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>
Like powder in a skitless soldier&#8217;s flask,<br>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br>
And thou dismember&#8217;d with thine own defence.<br>
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,<br>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;<br>
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,<br>
But thou slew&#8217;st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:<br>
The law that threaten&#8217;d death becomes thy friend<br>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:<br>
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;<br>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<br>
Thou pout&#8217;st upon thy fortune and thy love:<br>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<br>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:<br>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;<br>
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time<br>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back<br>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>
Than thou went&#8217;st forth in lamentation.<br>

Therefore stay yet; thou need&#8217;st not to be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Let me be ta&#8217;en, let me be put to
death;<br>
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<br>
I&#8217;ll say yon grey is not the morning&#8217;s eye,<br>
&#8217;Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia&#8217;s brow;<br>
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat<br>
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:<br>
I have more care to stay than will to go:<br>
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.<br>
How is&#8217;t, my soul? let&#8217;s talk; it is not day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!<br>
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,<br>
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.<br>
Some say the lark makes sweet division;<br>
This doth not so, for she divideth us:<br>
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,<br>
O, now I would they had changed voices too!<br>
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,<br>
Hunting thee hence with hunt&#8217;s-up to the day,<br>
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">More light and light; more dark and dark our
woes!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Nurse, to the
chamber</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Madam!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Nurse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:<br>
The day is broke; be wary, look about.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Then, window, let day in, and let life out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I&#8217;ll
descend.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He goeth down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband,
friend!<br>
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,<br>
For in a minute there are many days:<br>
O, by this count I shall be much in years<br>
Ere I again behold my Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell!<br>
I will omit no opportunity<br>
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O think&#8217;st thou we shall ever meet
again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt it not; and all these woes shall
serve<br>
For sweet discourses in our time to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O God, I have an ill-divining soul!<br>
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,<br>
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:<br>
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look&#8217;st pale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:<br>
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:<br>
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.<br>
That is renown&#8217;d for faith? Be fickle, fortune;<br>
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,<br>
But send him back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Ho, daughter!
are you up?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Who is&#8217;t that calls? is it my lady
mother?<br>
Is she not down so late, or up so early?<br>
What unaccustom&#8217;d cause procures her hither?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lady Capulet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Juliet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I am not well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Evermore weeping for your cousin&#8217;s
death?<br>
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?<br>
An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;<br>
Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;<br>
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">So shall you feel the loss, but not the
friend<br>
Which you weep for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Feeling so the loss,<br>
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, girl, thou weep&#8217;st not so much for
his death,<br>
As that the villain lives which slaughter&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What villain madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">That same villain, Romeo.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Villain and he
be many miles asunder.&#8212;<br>
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;<br>
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">That is, because the traitor murderer lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:<br>
Would none but I might venge my cousin&#8217;s death!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:<br>
Then weep no more. I&#8217;ll send to one in Mantua,<br>
Where that same banish&#8217;d runagate doth live,<br>
Shall give him such an unaccustom&#8217;d dram,<br>
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:<br>
And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I never shall be satisfied<br>
With Romeo, till I behold him&#8212;dead&#8212;<br>
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex&#8217;d.<br>
Madam, if you could find out but a man<br>
To bear a poison, I would temper it;<br>
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,<br>
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors<br>
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.<br>
To wreak the love I bore my cousin<br>
Upon his body that slaughter&#8217;d him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Find thou the means, and I&#8217;ll find such a
man.<br>
But now I&#8217;ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">And joy comes well in such a needy time:<br>
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, thou hast a careful father,
child;<br>
One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,<br>
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,<br>
That thou expect&#8217;st not nor I look&#8217;d not for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, in happy time, what day is that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,<br>
The gallant, young and noble gentleman,<br>
The County Paris, at Saint Peter&#8217;s Church,<br>
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Saint Peter&#8217;s Church and Peter
too,<br>
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.<br>
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed<br>
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.<br>
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<br>
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,<br>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,<br>
And see how he will take it at your hands.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Capulet and
Nurse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;<br>
But for the sunset of my brother&#8217;s son<br>
It rains downright.<br>
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?<br>
Evermore showering? In one little body<br>
Thou counterfeit&#8217;st a bark, a sea, a wind;<br>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br>
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;<br>
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,<br>
Without a sudden calm, will overset<br>
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!<br>
Have you deliver&#8217;d to her our decree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you
thanks.<br>
I would the fool were married to her grave!</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Soft! take me with you, take me with you,
wife.<br>
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?<br>
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,<br>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you
have:<br>
Proud can I never be of what I hate;<br>
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?<br>
&#8216;Proud,&#8217; and &#8216;I thank you,&#8217; and &#8216;I
thank you not;&#8217;<br>
And yet &#8216;not proud,&#8217; mistress minion, you,<br>
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,<br>
But fettle your fine joints &#8217;gainst Thursday next,<br>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter&#8217;s Church,<br>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!<br>
You tallow-face!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<br>
I tell thee what: get thee to church o&#8217; Thursday,<br>
Or never after look me in the face:<br>
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;<br>
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br>
That God had lent us but this only child;<br>
But now I see this one is one too much,<br>
And that we have a curse in having her:<br>
Out on her, hilding!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">God in heaven bless her!<br>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,<br>
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I speak no treason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O, God ye god-den.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">May not one speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, you mumbling fool!<br>
Utter your gravity o&#8217;er a gossip&#8217;s bowl;<br>
For here we need it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">You are too hot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s bread! it makes me mad:<br>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br>
To have her match&#8217;d: and having now provided<br>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train&#8217;d,<br>
Stuff&#8217;d, as they say, with honourable parts,<br>
Proportion&#8217;d as one&#8217;s thought would wish a man;<br>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>
A whining mammet, in her fortune&#8217;s tender,<br>
To answer &#8216;I&#8217;ll not wed; I cannot love,<br>
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.&#8217;<br>
But, as you will not wed, I&#8217;ll pardon you:<br>
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:<br>
Look to&#8217;t, think on&#8217;t, I do not use to jest.<br>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br>
An you be mine, I&#8217;ll give you to my friend;<br>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,<br>
For, by my soul, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er acknowledge thee,<br>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:<br>
Trust to&#8217;t, bethink you; I&#8217;ll not be forsworn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br>
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not to me, for I&#8217;ll not speak a
word:<br>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O God!&#8212;O nurse, how shall this be
prevented?<br>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;<br>
How shall that faith return again to earth,<br>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.<br>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br>
Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br>
What say&#8217;st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?<br>
Some comfort, nurse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, here it is.<br>
Romeo is banish&#8217;d; and all the world to nothing,<br>
That he dares ne&#8217;er come back to challenge you;<br>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br>
I think it best you married with the county.<br>
O, he&#8217;s a lovely gentleman!<br>
Romeo&#8217;s a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,<br>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br>
Your first is dead; or &#8217;twere as good he were,<br>
As living here and you no use of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">And from my soul too;<br>
Or else beshrew them both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br>
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,<br>
Having displeased my father, to Laurence&#8217; cell,<br>
To make confession and to be absolved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br>
Which she hath praised him with above compare<br>
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;<br>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br>
I&#8217;ll to the friar, to know his remedy:<br>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.</p>

<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">My father Capulet will have it so;<br>
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">You say you do not know the lady&#8217;s
mind:<br>
Uneven is the course, I like it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt&#8217;s
death,<br>
And therefore have I little talk&#8217;d of love;<br>
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.<br>
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous<br>
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,<br>
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,<br>
To stop the inundation of her tears;<br>
Which, too much minded by herself alone,<br>
May be put from her by society:<br>
Now do you know the reason of this haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I would I knew
not why it should be slow&#8217;d.<br>
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Happily met, my lady and my wife!</p>

<p class="speech">That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What must be shall be.</p>

<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a certain text.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Come you to make confession to this father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">To answer that, I should confess to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Do not deny to him that you love me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">I will confess to you that I love him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">If I do so, it will be of more price,<br>
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Poor soul, thy face is much abused with
tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">The tears have got small victory by that;<br>
For it was bad enough before their spite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wrong&#8217;st it, more than tears, with
that report.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;<br>
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander&#8217;d
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so, for it is not mine own.<br>
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;<br>
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.<br>
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Paris</p>
<p class="speech">God shield I should disturb devotion!<br>
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:<br>
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,<br>
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;<br>
It strains me past the compass of my wits:<br>
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,<br>
On Thursday next be married to this county.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me not, friar, that thou hear&#8217;st of
this,<br>
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:<br>
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,<br>
Do thou but call my resolution wise,<br>
And with this knife I&#8217;ll help it presently.<br>
God join&#8217;d my heart and Romeo&#8217;s, thou our hands;<br>
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal&#8217;d,<br>
Shall be the label to another deed,<br>
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt<br>
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:<br>
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,<br>
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,<br>
&#8217;Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife<br>
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that<br>
Which the commission of thy years and art<br>
Could to no issue of true honour bring.<br>
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,<br>
If what thou speak&#8217;st speak not of remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,<br>
Which craves as desperate an execution.<br>
As that is desperate which we would prevent.<br>
If, rather than to marry County Paris,<br>
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,<br>
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake<br>
A thing like death to chide away this shame,<br>
That copest with death himself to scape from it:<br>
And, if thou darest, I&#8217;ll give thee remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,<br>
From off the battlements of yonder tower;<br>
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk<br>
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;<br>
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,<br>
O&#8217;er-cover&#8217;d quite with dead men&#8217;s rattling
bones,<br>
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;<br>
Or bid me go into a new-made grave<br>
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;<br>
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;<br>
And I will do it without fear or doubt,<br>
To live an unstain&#8217;d wife to my sweet love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent<br>
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:<br>
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;<br>
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:<br>
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,<br>
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;<br>
When presently through all thy veins shall run<br>
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse<br>
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:<br>
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;<br>
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade<br>
To paly ashes, thy eyes&#8217; windows fall,<br>
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;<br>
Each part, deprived of supple government,<br>
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:<br>
And in this borrow&#8217;d likeness of shrunk death<br>
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,<br>
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.<br>
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes<br>
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:<br>
Then, as the manner of our country is,<br>
In thy best robes uncover&#8217;d on the bier<br>
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault<br>
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.<br>
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,<br>
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,<br>
And hither shall he come: and he and I<br>
Will watch thy waking, and that very night<br>
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.<br>
And this shall free thee from this present shame;<br>
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,<br>
Abate thy valour in the acting it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous<br>
In this resolve: I&#8217;ll send a friar with speed<br>
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.</p>

I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,<br>
For he hath still been tried a holy man.<br>
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,<br>
I wake before the time that Romeo<br>
Come to redeem me? there&#8217;s a fearful point!<br>
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,<br>
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,<br>
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?<br>
Or, if I live, is it not very like,<br>
The horrible conceit of death and night,<br>
Together with the terror of the place,&#8212;<br>
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,<br>
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones<br>
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:<br>
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,<br>
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,<br>
At some hours in the night spirits resort;&#8212;<br>
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,<br>
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,<br>
And shrieks like mandrakes&#8217; torn out of the earth,<br>
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:&#8212;<br>
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,<br>
Environed with all these hideous fears?<br>
And madly play with my forefather&#8217;s joints?<br>
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?<br>
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman&#8217;s bone,<br>
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?<br>
O, look! methinks I see my cousin&#8217;s ghost<br>
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body<br>
Upon a rapier&#8217;s point: stay, Tybalt, stay!<br>
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.</p>

And hereabouts he dwells,&#8212;which late I noted<br>
In tatter&#8217;d weeds, with overwhelming brows,<br>
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,<br>
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:<br>
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,<br>
An alligator stuff&#8217;d, and other skins<br>
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves<br>
A beggarly account of empty boxes,<br>
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,<br>
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,<br>
Were thinly scatter&#8217;d, to make up a show.<br>
Noting this penury, to myself I said<br>
&#8216;An if a man did need a poison now,<br>
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,<br>
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.&#8217;<br>
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;<br>
And this same needy man must sell it me.<br>
As I remember, this should be the house.<br>
Being holiday, the beggar&#8217;s shop is shut.<br>
What, ho! apothecary!</p>

<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Who calls so loud?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:<br>
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have<br>
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear<br>
As will disperse itself through all the veins<br>
That the life-weary taker may fall dead<br>
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath<br>
As violently as hasty powder fired<br>
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon&#8217;s womb.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua&#8217;s
law<br>
Is death to any he that utters them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,<br>
And fear&#8217;st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,<br>
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,<br>
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;<br>
The world is not thy friend nor the world&#8217;s law;<br>
The world affords no law to make thee rich;<br>
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">My poverty, but not my will, consents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apothecary</p>
<p class="speech">Put this in any liquid thing you will,<br>
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength<br>
Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">There is thy gold, worse poison to men&#8217;s
souls,<br>
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,<br>
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.<br>
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.<br>
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.<br>
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me<br>
To Juliet&#8217;s grave; for there must I use thee.</p>

Thou art not conquer&#8217;d; beauty&#8217;s ensign yet<br>

To sunder his that was thine enemy?<br>
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,<br>
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe<br>
That unsubstantial death is amorous,<br>
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps<br>
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?<br>
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;<br>
And never from this palace of dim night<br>
Depart again: here, here will I remain<br>
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here<br>

From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!<br>

<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">I will be brief, for my short date of breath<br>
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.<br>
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;<br>
And she, there dead, that Romeo&#8217;s faithful wife:<br>
I married them; and their stol&#8217;n marriage-day<br>
Was Tybalt&#8217;s dooms-day, whose untimely death<br>
Banish&#8217;d the new-made bridegroom from the city,<br>
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.<br>
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,<br>
Betroth&#8217;d and would have married her perforce<br>
To County Paris: then comes she to me,<br>
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean<br>
To rid her from this second marriage,<br>
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.<br>
Then gave I her, so tutor&#8217;d by my art,<br>
A sleeping potion; which so took effect<br>
As I intended, for it wrought on her<br>
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,<br>
That he should hither come as this dire night,<br>
To help to take her from her borrow&#8217;d grave,<br>
Being the time the potion&#8217;s force should cease.<br>
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,<br>
Was stay&#8217;d by accident, and yesternight<br>
Return&#8217;d my letter back. Then all alone<br>
At the prefixed hour of her waking,<br>
Came I to take her from her kindred&#8217;s vault;<br>
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,<br>
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:<br>
But when I came, some minute ere the time<br>
Of her awaking, here untimely lay<br>
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.<br>
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,<br>
And bear this work of heaven with patience:<br>
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;<br>
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,<br>
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.<br>
All this I know; and to the marriage<br>
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this<br>
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life<br>
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,<br>
Unto the rigour of severest law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">We still have known thee for a holy man.<br>
Where&#8217;s Romeo&#8217;s man? what can he say in this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Balthasar</p>
<p class="speech">I brought my master news of Juliet&#8217;s
death;<br>
And then in post he came from Mantua<br>
To this same place, to this same monument.<br>
This letter he early bid me give his father,<br>
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,<br>
I departed not and left him there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the letter; I will look on it.<br>
Where is the county&#8217;s page, that raised the watch?<br>
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">He came with flowers to strew his lady&#8217;s
grave;<br>
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:<br>
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;<br>
And by and by my master drew on him;<br>
And then I ran away to call the watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">This letter doth make good the friar&#8217;s
words,<br>
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:<br>
And here he writes that he did buy a poison<br>
Of a poor &#8217;pothecary, and therewithal<br>
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.<br>
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!<br>
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,<br>
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.<br>
And I for winking at your discords too<br>
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O brother Montague, give me thy hand:<br>
This is my daughter&#8217;s jointure, for no more<br>
Can I demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But I can give thee more:<br>
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;<br>
That while Verona by that name is known,<br>
There shall no figure at such rate be set<br>
As that of true and faithful Juliet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">As rich shall Romeo&#8217;s by his lady&#8217;s
lie;<br>
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">A glooming peace this morning with it brings;<br>
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:<br>
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;<br>
Some shall be pardon&#8217;d, and some punished:<br>
For never was a story of more woe<br>
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.</p>
