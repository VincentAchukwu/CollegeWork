<h4>Scene I. Rome. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Judges, Senators and
Tribunes, with Martius and Quintus, bound, passing on to the place
of execution; Titus going before, pleading</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!<br>
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent<br>
In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;<br>
For all my blood in Rome&#8217;s great quarrel shed;<br>
For all the frosty nights that I have watch&#8217;d;<br>
And for these bitter tears, which now you see<br>
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;<br>
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,<br>
Whose souls are not corrupted as &#8217;tis thought.<br>
For two and twenty sons I never wept,<br>
Because they died in honour&#8217;s lofty bed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lieth down; the Judges, &amp;
c., pass by him, and Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech">For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I
write<br>
My heart&#8217;s deep languor and my soul&#8217;s sad tears:<br>
Let my tears stanch the earth&#8217;s dry appetite;<br>
My sons&#8217; sweet blood will make it shame and blush.<br>
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,<br>
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,<br>
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:<br>
In summer&#8217;s drought I&#8217;ll drop upon thee still;<br>
In winter with warm tears I&#8217;ll melt the snow<br>
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,<br>
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons&#8217; blood.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius, with his sword
drawn</span></p>
<p class="speech">O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!<br>
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;<br>
And let me say, that never wept before,<br>
My tears are now prevailing orators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O noble father, you lament in vain:<br>
The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;<br>
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.<br>
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,<br>
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,<br>
They would not pity me, yet plead I must;<br>
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;<br>
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,<br>
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,<br>
For that they will not intercept my tale:<br>
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet<br>
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;<br>
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,<br>
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.<br>
A stone is soft as wax,&#8212;tribunes more hard than stones;<br>
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,<br>
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Rises</span></p>
<p class="speech">But wherefore stand&#8217;st thou with thy weapon
drawn?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">To rescue my two brothers from their death:<br>
For which attempt the judges have pronounced<br>
My everlasting doom of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O happy man! they have befriended thee.<br>
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive<br>
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?<br>
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey<br>
But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,<br>
From these devourers to be banished!<br>
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Marcus and
Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;<br>
Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:<br>
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Will it consume me? let me see it, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">This was thy daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Marcus, so she is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me, this object kills me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.<br>
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand<br>
Hath made thee handless in thy father&#8217;s sight?<br>
What fool hath added water to the sea,<br>
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?<br>
My grief was at the height before thou camest,<br>
And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.<br>
Give me a sword, I&#8217;ll chop off my hands too;<br>
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;<br>
And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;<br>
In bootless prayer have they been held up,<br>
And they have served me to effectless use:<br>
Now all the service I require of them<br>
Is that the one will help to cut the other.<br>
&#8217;Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;<br>
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr&#8217;d
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, that delightful engine of her thoughts<br>
That blabb&#8217;d them with such pleasing eloquence,<br>
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,<br>
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung<br>
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, thus I found her, straying in the park,<br>
Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer<br>
That hath received some unrecuring wound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">It was my deer; and he that wounded her<br>
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:<br>
For now I stand as one upon a rock<br>
Environed with a wilderness of sea,<br>
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,<br>
Expecting ever when some envious surge<br>
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.<br>
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;<br>
Here stands my other son, a banished man,<br>
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.<br>
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,<br>
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.<br>
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,<br>
It would have madded me: what shall I do<br>
Now I behold thy lively body so?<br>
Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:<br>
Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr&#8217;d thee:<br>
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death<br>
Thy brothers are condemn&#8217;d, and dead by this.<br>
Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!<br>
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears<br>
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew<br>
Upon a gather&#8217;d lily almost wither&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance she weeps because they kill&#8217;d her
husband;<br>
Perchance because she knows them innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful<br>
Because the law hath ta&#8217;en revenge on them.<br>
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;<br>
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.<br>
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.<br>
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:<br>
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,<br>
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,<br>
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks<br>
How they are stain&#8217;d, as meadows, yet not dry,<br>
With miry slime left on them by a flood?<br>
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long<br>
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,<br>
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?<br>
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?<br>
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows<br>
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?<br>
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,<br>
Plot some deuce of further misery,<br>
To make us wonder&#8217;d at in time to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your
grief,<br>
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot<br>
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,<br>
For thou, poor man, hast drown&#8217;d it with thine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:<br>
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say<br>
That to her brother which I said to thee:<br>
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,<br>
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.<br>
O, what a sympathy of woe is this,<br>
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor<br>
Sends thee this word,&#8212;that, if thou love thy sons,<br>
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,<br>
Or any one of you, chop off your hand,<br>
And send it to the king: he for the same<br>
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;<br>
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!<br>
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,<br>
That gives sweet tidings of the sun&#8217;s uprise?<br>
With all my heart, I&#8217;ll send the emperor My hand:<br>
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,<br>
That hath thrown down so many enemies,<br>
Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:<br>
My youth can better spare my blood than you;<br>
And therefore mine shall save my brothers&#8217; lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Which of your hands hath not
defended Rome,<br>
And rear&#8217;d aloft the bloody battle-axe,<br>
Writing destruction on the enemy&#8217;s castle?<br>
O, none of both but are of high desert:<br>
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve<br>
To ransom my two nephews from their death;<br>
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,<br>
For fear they die before their pardon come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">My hand shall go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By heaven, it shall not go!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, strive no more: such wither&#8217;d herbs
as these<br>
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,<br>
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">And, for our father&#8217;s sake and
mother&#8217;s care,<br>
Now let me show a brother&#8217;s love to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Agree between you; I will spare my hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Then I&#8217;ll go fetch an axe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But I will use the axe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucius and
Marcus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, Aaron; I&#8217;ll deceive them
both:<br>
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If that be
call&#8217;d deceit, I will be honest,<br>
And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:<br>
But I&#8217;ll deceive you in another sort,<br>
And that you&#8217;ll say, ere half an hour pass.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cuts off Titus&#8217;s
hand</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucius and
Marcus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now stay your strife: what shall be is
dispatch&#8217;d.<br>
Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:<br>
Tell him it was a hand that warded him<br>
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it<br>
More hath it merited; that let it have.<br>
As for my sons, say I account of them<br>
As jewels purchased at an easy price;<br>
And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand<br>
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany<br>
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!<br>
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.<br>
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,<br>
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:<br>
If any power pities wretched tears,<br>
To that I call!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, wilt thou kneel with me?<br>
Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;<br>
Or with our sighs we&#8217;ll breathe the welkin dim,<br>
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds<br>
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O brother, speak with possibilities,<br>
And do not break into these deep extremes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?<br>
Then be my passions bottomless with them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But yet let reason govern thy lament.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">If there were reason for these miseries,<br>
Then into limits could I bind my woes:<br>
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o&#8217;erflow?<br>
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,<br>
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?<br>
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?<br>
I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!<br>
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:<br>
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;<br>
Then must my earth with her continual tears<br>
Become a deluge, overflow&#8217;d and drown&#8217;d;<br>
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,<br>
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.<br>
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave<br>
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger, with two
heads and a hand</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid<br>
For that good hand thou sent&#8217;st the emperor.<br>
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;<br>
And here&#8217;s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;<br>
Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock&#8217;d;<br>
That woe is me to think upon thy woes<br>
More than remembrance of my father&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,<br>
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!<br>
These miseries are more than may be borne.<br>
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;<br>
But sorrow flouted at is double death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, that this sight should make so deep a
wound,<br>
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!<br>
That ever death should let life bear his name,<br>
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lavinia kisses
Titus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless<br>
As frozen water to a starved snake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">When will this fearful slumber have an end?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;<br>
Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons&#8217; heads,<br>
Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:<br>
Thy other banish&#8217;d son, with this dear sight<br>
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,<br>
Even like a stony image, cold and numb.<br>
Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:<br>
Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand<br>
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight<br>
The closing up of our most wretched eyes;<br>
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this
hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I have not another tear to shed:<br>
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,<br>
And would usurp upon my watery eyes<br>
And make them blind with tributary tears:<br>
Then which way shall I find Revenge&#8217;s cave?<br>
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,<br>
And threat me I shall never come to bliss<br>
Till all these mischiefs be return&#8217;d again<br>
Even in their throats that have committed them.<br>
Come, let me see what task I have to do.<br>
You heavy people, circle me about,<br>
That I may turn me to each one of you,<br>
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.<br>
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;<br>
And in this hand the other I will bear.<br>
Lavinia, thou shalt be employ&#8217;d: these arms!<br>
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.<br>
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;<br>
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:<br>
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:<br>
And, if you love me, as I think you do,<br>
Let&#8217;s kiss and part, for we have much to do.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Titus, Marcus, and
Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,<br>
The wofull&#8217;st man that ever lived in Rome:<br>
Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,<br>
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:<br>
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;<br>
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!<br>
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives<br>
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.<br>
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;<br>
And make proud Saturnine and his empress<br>
Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.<br>
Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,<br>
To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus, Marcus, Lavinia
and Young Lucius, a boy</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more<br>
Than will preserve just so much strength in us<br>
As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.<br>
Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:<br>
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,<br>
And cannot passionate our tenfold grief<br>
With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine<br>
Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;<br>
Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,<br>
Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,<br>
Then thus I thump it down.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in
signs!<br>
When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,<br>
Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.<br>
Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;<br>
Or get some little knife between thy teeth,<br>
And just against thy heart make thou a hole;<br>
That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall<br>
May run into that sink, and soaking in<br>
Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay<br>
Such violent hands upon her tender life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?<br>
Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.<br>
What violent hands can she lay on her life?<br>
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;<br>
To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o&#8217;er,<br>
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?<br>
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,<br>
Lest we remember still that we have none.<br>
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,<br>
As if we should forget we had no hands,<br>
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!<br>
Come, let&#8217;s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:<br>
Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;<br>
I can interpret all her martyr&#8217;d signs;<br>
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,<br>
Brew&#8217;d with her sorrow, mesh&#8217;d upon her cheeks:<br>
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;<br>
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect<br>
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:<br>
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,<br>
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,<br>
But I of these will wrest an alphabet<br>
And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep
laments:<br>
Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,<br>
Doth weep to see his grandsire&#8217;s heaviness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of
tears,<br>
And tears will quickly melt thy life away.</p>

<p class="speech">What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy
knife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>

fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee, murderer! thou kill&#8217;st my
heart;<br>
Mine eyes are cloy&#8217;d with view of tyranny:<br>
A deed of death done on the innocent<br>
Becomes not Titus&#8217; brother: get thee gone:<br>
I see thou art not for my company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, my lord, I have but kill&#8217;d a fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But how, if that fly had a father and mother?<br>
How would he hang his slender gilded wings,<br>
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!<br>
Poor harmless fly,<br>
That, with his pretty buzzing melody,<br>
Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
kill&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor&#8217;d
fly,<br>
Like to the empress&#8217; Moor; therefore I kill&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, O, O,<br>
Then pardon me for reprehending thee,<br>
For thou hast done a charitable deed.<br>
Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;<br>
Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor<br>
Come hither purposely to poison me.&#8212;<br>
There&#8217;s for thyself, and that&#8217;s for Tamora.<br>
Ah, sirrah!<br>
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,<br>
But that between us we can kill a fly<br>
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,<br>
He takes false shadows for true substances.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:<br>
I&#8217;ll to thy closet; and go read with thee<br>
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.<br>
Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,<br>
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.</p>
