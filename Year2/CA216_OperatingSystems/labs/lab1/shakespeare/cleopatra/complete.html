<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Demetrius and
Philo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Philo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but this dotage of our general&#8217;s<br>
O&#8217;erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,<br>
That o&#8217;er the files and musters of the war<br>
Have glow&#8217;d like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,<br>
The office and devotion of their view<br>
Upon a tawny front: his captain&#8217;s heart,<br>
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst<br>
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,<br>
And is become the bellows and the fan<br>
To cool a gipsy&#8217;s lust.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter Antony,
Cleopatra, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning
her</span></p>
<p class="speech">Look, where they come:<br>
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.<br>
The triple pillar of the world transform&#8217;d<br>
Into a strumpet&#8217;s fool: behold and see.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">If it be love indeed, tell me how much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s beggary in the love that can be
reckon&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new
earth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">News, my good lord, from Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Grates me: the sum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear them, Antony:<br>
Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows<br>
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent<br>
His powerful mandate to you, &#8216;Do this, or this;<br>
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;<br>
Perform &#8217;t, or else we damn thee.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How, my love!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance! nay, and most like:<br>
You must not stay here longer, your dismission<br>
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.<br>
Where&#8217;s Fulvia&#8217;s process? Caesar&#8217;s I would say?
both?<br>
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt&#8217;s queen,<br>
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine<br>
Is Caesar&#8217;s homager: else so thy cheek pays shame<br>
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch<br>
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.<br>
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike<br>
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life<br>
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Embracing</span></p>
<p class="speech">And such a twain can do&#8217;t, in which I
bind,<br>
On pain of punishment, the world to weet<br>
We stand up peerless.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent falsehood!<br>
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?<br>
I&#8217;ll seem the fool I am not; Antony<br>
Will be himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;But stirr&#8217;d by Cleopatra.<br>
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,<br>
Let&#8217;s not confound the time with conference harsh:<br>
There&#8217;s not a minute of our lives should stretch<br>
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Hear the ambassadors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, wrangling queen!<br>
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,<br>
To weep; whose every passion fully strives<br>
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!<br>
No messenger, but thine; and all alone<br>
To-night we&#8217;ll wander through the streets and note<br>
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;<br>
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mark Antony and
Cleopatra with their train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Philo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,<br>
He comes too short of that great property<br>
Which still should go with Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I am full sorry<br>
That he approves the common liar, who<br>
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope<br>
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!</p>

and a Soothsayer</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing
Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where&#8217;s the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Soothsayer!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the man? Is&#8217;t you, sir, that know
things?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">In nature&#8217;s infinite book of secrecy<br>
A little I can read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Show him your hand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Domitius
Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough<br>
Cleopatra&#8217;s health to drink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, give me good fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">I make not, but foresee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, then, foresee me one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be yet far fairer than you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">He means in flesh.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">No, you shall paint when you are old.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Wrinkles forbid!</p>

<p class="speech">Vex not his prescience; be attentive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Hush!</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall be more beloving than beloved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather heat my liver with drinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be
married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent! I love long life better than
figs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">You have seen and proved a fairer former
fortune<br>
Than that which is to approach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">If every of your wishes had a womb.<br>
And fertile every wish, a million.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">You think none but your sheets are privy to your
wishes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, tell Iras hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll know all our fortunes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night,
shall
be&#8212;drunk to bed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s a palm presages chastity, if
nothing else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en as the o&#8217;erflowing Nilus
presageth famine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Your fortunes are alike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">But how, but how? give me particulars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">I have said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better
than<br>
I, where would you choose it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Not in my husband&#8217;s nose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Our worser thoughts heavens mend!
Alexas,&#8212;come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the
people!
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alexas</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me
a
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
they&#8217;ld do&#8217;t!</p>

<p class="speech">No, madam.</p>

A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!</p>

Upon the first encounter, drave them.</p>

Importeth thee to know, this bears.</p>

<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Second
Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s a great spirit gone! Thus did I
desire it:<br>
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,<br>
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,<br>
By revolution lowering, does become<br>
The opposite of itself: she&#8217;s good, being gone;<br>
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.<br>
I must from this enchanting queen break off:<br>
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,<br>
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Domitius
Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your pleasure, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I must with haste from hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death&#8217;s the word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I must be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it
were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">She is cunning past man&#8217;s thought.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Alexas</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing
but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Would I had never seen her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful
piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Fulvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice.
When
it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
out, there are members to make new. If there were
no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
that should water this sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">The business she hath broached in the state<br>
Cannot endure my absence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">And the business you have broached here cannot
be
without you; especially that of Cleopatra&#8217;s, which
wholly depends on your abode.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">No more light answers. Let our officers<br>
Have notice what we purpose. I shall break<br>
The cause of our expedience to the queen,<br>
And get her leave to part. For not alone<br>
The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,<br>
Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too<br>
Of many our contriving friends in Rome<br>
Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius<br>
Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands<br>
The empire of the sea: our slippery people,<br>
Whose love is never link&#8217;d to the deserver<br>
Till his deserts are past, begin to throw<br>
Pompey the Great and all his dignities<br>
Upon his son; who, high in name and power,<br>
Higher than both in blood and life, stands up<br>
For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,<br>
The sides o&#8217; the world may danger: much is breeding,<br>
Which, like the courser&#8217;s hair, hath yet but life,<br>
And not a serpent&#8217;s poison. Say, our pleasure,<br>
To such whose place is under us, requires<br>
Our quick remove from hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I shall do&#8217;t.</p>

What says the married woman? You may go:<br>
Would she had never given you leave to come!<br>
Let her not say &#8217;tis I that keep you here:<br>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O, never was there queen<br>
So mightily betray&#8217;d! yet at the first<br>

Which break themselves in swearing!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Most sweet queen,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,<br>
But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,<br>
Then was the time for words: no going then;<br>
Eternity was in our lips and eyes,<br>
Bliss in our brows&#8217; bent; none our parts so poor,<br>
But was a race of heaven: they are so still,<br>
Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,<br>
Art turn&#8217;d the greatest liar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How now, lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know<br>
There were a heart in Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, queen:<br>
The strong necessity of time commands<br>
Our services awhile; but my full heart<br>
Remains in use with you. Our Italy<br>
Shines o&#8217;er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius<br>
Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:<br>
Equality of two domestic powers<br>
Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,<br>
Are newly grown to love: the condemn&#8217;d Pompey,<br>
Rich in his father&#8217;s honour, creeps apace,<br>
Into the hearts of such as have not thrived<br>
Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;<br>
And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge<br>
By any desperate change: my more particular,<br>
And that which most with you should safe my going,<br>
Is Fulvia&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Though age from folly could not give me
freedom,<br>
It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s dead, my queen:<br>
Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read<br>
The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:<br>
See when and where she died.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O most false love!<br>
Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill<br>
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,<br>
In Fulvia&#8217;s death, how mine received shall be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know<br>
The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,<br>
As you shall give the advice. By the fire<br>
That quickens Nilus&#8217; slime, I go from hence<br>
Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war<br>
As thou affect&#8217;st.</p>

So Antony loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My precious queen, forbear;<br>
And give true evidence to his love, which stands<br>
An honourable trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">So Fulvia told me.<br>
I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,<br>
Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears<br>
Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene<br>
Of excellent dissembling; and let it look<br>
Life perfect honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>

<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my sword,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">And target. Still he mends;<br>
But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,<br>
How this Herculean Roman does become<br>
The carriage of his chafe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll leave you, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Courteous lord, one word.<br>
Sir, you and I must part, but that&#8217;s not it:<br>
Sir, you and I have loved, but there&#8217;s not it;<br>
That you know well: something it is I would,<br>
O, my oblivion is a very Antony,<br>
And I am all forgotten.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">But that your royalty<br>
Holds idleness your subject, I should take you<br>
For idleness itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis sweating labour<br>
To bear such idleness so near the heart<br>
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;<br>
Since my becomings kill me, when they do not<br>
Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;<br>
Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.<br>
And all the gods go with you! upon your sword<br>
Sit laurel victory! and smooth success<br>
Be strew&#8217;d before your feet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let us go. Come;<br>
Our separation so abides, and flies,<br>

<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,<br>
It is not Caesar&#8217;s natural vice to hate<br>
Our great competitor: from Alexandria<br>
This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes<br>
The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like<br>
Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy<br>
More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or<br>
Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there<br>
A man who is the abstract of all faults<br>
That all men follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">I must not think there are<br>
Evils enow to darken all his goodness:<br>
His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,<br>
More fiery by night&#8217;s blackness; hereditary,<br>
Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,<br>
Than what he chooses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is
not<br>
Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;<br>
To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit<br>
And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;<br>
To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet<br>
With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
becomes him,&#8212;<br>
As his composure must be rare indeed<br>
Whom these things cannot blemish,&#8212;yet must Antony<br>
No way excuse his soils, when we do bear<br>
So great weight in his lightness. If he fill&#8217;d<br>
His vacancy with his voluptuousness,<br>
Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,<br>
Call on him for&#8217;t: but to confound such time,<br>
That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud<br>
As his own state and ours,&#8212;&#8217;tis to be chid<br>
As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,<br>
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,<br>
And so rebel to judgment.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s more news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,<br>
Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report<br>
How &#8217;tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;<br>
And it appears he is beloved of those<br>
That only have fear&#8217;d Caesar: to the ports<br>
The discontents repair, and men&#8217;s reports<br>
Give him much wrong&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I should have known no less.<br>
It hath been taught us from the primal state,<br>
That he which is was wish&#8217;d until he were;<br>
And the ebb&#8217;d man, ne&#8217;er loved till ne&#8217;er worth
love,<br>
Comes dear&#8217;d by being lack&#8217;d. This common body,<br>
Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,<br>
Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,<br>
To rot itself with motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, I bring thee word,<br>
Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,<br>
Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound<br>
With keels of every kind: many hot inroads<br>
They make in Italy; the borders maritime<br>
Lack blood to think on&#8217;t, and flush youth revolt:<br>
No vessel can peep forth, but &#8217;tis as soon<br>
Taken as seen; for Pompey&#8217;s name strikes more<br>
Than could his war resisted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Antony,<br>
Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once<br>
Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew&#8217;st<br>
Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel<br>
Did famine follow; whom thou fought&#8217;st against,<br>
Though daintily brought up, with patience more<br>
Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink<br>
The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle<br>
Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign<br>
The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;<br>
Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,<br>
The barks of trees thou browsed&#8217;st; on the Alps<br>
It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,<br>
Which some did die to look on: and all this&#8212;<br>
It wounds thine honour that I speak it now&#8212;<br>
Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek<br>
So much as lank&#8217;d not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis pity of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Let his shames quickly<br>
Drive him to Rome: &#8217;tis time we twain<br>
Did show ourselves i&#8217; the field; and to that end<br>
Assemble we immediate council: Pompey<br>
Thrives in our idleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, Caesar,<br>
I shall be furnish&#8217;d to inform you rightly<br>
Both what by sea and land I can be able<br>
To front this present time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Till which encounter,<br>
It is my business too. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my lord: what you shall know
meantime<br>
Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,<br>
To let me be partaker.</p>

O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!<br>
Do bravely, horse! for wot&#8217;st thou whom thou movest?<br>

Or murmuring &#8216;Where&#8217;s my serpent of old
Nile?&#8217;<br>
For so he calls me: now I feed myself<br>
With most delicious poison. Think on me,<br>
That am with Phoebus&#8217; amorous pinches black,<br>

When thou wast here above the ground, I was<br>

This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,<br>

Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,<br>
Say thou, shall call her mistress.&#8217; So he nodded,<br>

<p class="speech">Nay, then.</p>

<p class="speech">I learn, you take things ill which are not
so,<br>
Or being, concern you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I must be laugh&#8217;d at,<br>
If, or for nothing or a little, I<br>
Should say myself offended, and with you<br>
Chiefly i&#8217; the world; more laugh&#8217;d at, that I
should<br>
Once name you derogately, when to sound your name<br>
It not concern&#8217;d me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">My being in Egypt, Caesar,<br>
What was&#8217;t to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">No more than my residing here at Rome<br>
Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there<br>
Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt<br>
Might be my question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">How intend you, practised?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You may be pleased to catch at mine intent<br>
By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother<br>
Made wars upon me; and their contestation<br>
Was theme for you, you were the word of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You do mistake your business; my brother
never<br>
Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;<br>
And have my learning from some true reports,<br>
That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather<br>
Discredit my authority with yours;<br>
And make the wars alike against my stomach,<br>
Having alike your cause? Of this my letters<br>
Before did satisfy you. If you&#8217;ll patch a quarrel,<br>
As matter whole you have not to make it with,<br>
It must not be with this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You praise yourself<br>
By laying defects of judgment to me; but<br>
You patch&#8217;d up your excuses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, not so;<br>
I know you could not lack, I am certain on&#8217;t,<br>
Very necessity of this thought, that I,<br>
Your partner in the cause &#8217;gainst which he fought,<br>
Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars<br>
Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,<br>
I would you had her spirit in such another:<br>
The third o&#8217; the world is yours; which with a snaffle<br>
You may pace easy, but not such a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Would we had all such wives, that the men might
go
to wars with the women!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar<br>
Made out of her impatience, which not wanted<br>
Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant<br>
Did you too much disquiet: for that you must<br>
But say, I could not help it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I wrote to you<br>
When rioting in Alexandria; you<br>
Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts<br>
Did gibe my missive out of audience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
He fell upon me ere admitted: then<br>
Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want<br>
Of what I was i&#8217; the morning: but next day<br>
I told him of myself; which was as much<br>
As to have ask&#8217;d him pardon. Let this fellow<br>
Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,<br>
Out of our question wipe him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You have broken<br>
The article of your oath; which you shall never<br>
Have tongue to charge me with.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Soft, Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">No,<br>
Lepidus, let him speak:<br>
The honour is sacred which he talks on now,<br>
Supposing that I lack&#8217;d it. But, on, Caesar;<br>
The article of my oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">To lend me arms and aid when I required them;<br>
The which you both denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Neglected, rather;<br>
And then when poison&#8217;d hours had bound me up<br>
From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,<br>
I&#8217;ll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty<br>
Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power<br>
Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,<br>
To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;<br>
For which myself, the ignorant motive, do<br>
So far ask pardon as befits mine honour<br>
To stoop in such a case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis noble spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">If it might please you, to enforce no further<br>
The griefs between ye: to forget them quite<br>
Were to remember that the present need<br>
Speaks to atone you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Or, if you borrow one another&#8217;s love for
the
instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>

forgot.</p>

more.</p>

<p class="speech">Go to, then; your considerate stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">I do not much dislike the matter, but<br>
The manner of his speech; for&#8217;t cannot be<br>
We shall remain in friendship, our conditions<br>
So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew<br>
What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge<br>
O&#8217; the world I would pursue it.</p>

side,<br>
Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony<br>
Is now a widower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Say not so, Agrippa:<br>
If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof<br>
Were well deserved of rashness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I am not married, Caesar: let me hear<br>
Agrippa further speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">To hold you in perpetual amity,<br>
To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts<br>
With an unslipping knot, take Antony<br>
Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims<br>
No worse a husband than the best of men;<br>
Whose virtue and whose general graces speak<br>
That which none else can utter. By this marriage,<br>
All little jealousies, which now seem great,<br>
And all great fears, which now import their dangers,<br>
Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,<br>
Where now half tales be truths: her love to both<br>
Would, each to other and all loves to both,<br>
Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;<br>
For &#8217;tis a studied, not a present thought,<br>
By duty ruminated.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Will Caesar speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Not till he hears how Antony is touch&#8217;d<br>
With what is spoke already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">What power is in Agrippa,<br>
If I would say, &#8216;Agrippa, be it so,&#8217;<br>
To make this good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The power of Caesar, and<br>
His power unto Octavia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">May I never<br>
To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,<br>
Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:<br>
Further this act of grace: and from this hour<br>
The heart of brothers govern in our loves<br>
And sway our great designs!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">There is my hand.<br>
A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother<br>
Did ever love so dearly: let her live<br>
To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never<br>
Fly off our loves again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Happily, amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I did not think to draw my sword &#8217;gainst
Pompey;<br>
For he hath laid strange courtesies and great<br>
Of late upon me: I must thank him only,<br>
Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;<br>
At heel of that, defy him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Good Enobarbus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">We have cause to be glad that matters are so
well
digested. You stayed well by &#8217;t in Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance,
and
made the night light with drinking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast,
and
but twelve persons there; is this true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much
more
monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">She&#8217;s a most triumphant lady, if report be
square to
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">There she appeared indeed; or my reporter
devised
well for her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you.<br>
The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#8217;d throne,<br>
Burn&#8217;d on the water: the poop was beaten gold;<br>
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that<br>
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,<br>
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made<br>
The water which they beat to follow faster,<br>
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,<br>
It beggar&#8217;d all description: she did lie<br>
In her pavilion&#8212;cloth-of-gold of tissue&#8212;<br>
O&#8217;er-picturing that Venus where we see<br>
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her<br>
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,<br>
With divers-colour&#8217;d fans, whose wind did seem<br>
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,<br>
And what they undid did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">O, rare for Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,<br>
So many mermaids, tended her i&#8217; the eyes,<br>
And made their bends adornings: at the helm<br>
A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle<br>
Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,<br>
That yarely frame the office. From the barge<br>
A strange invisible perfume hits the sense<br>
Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast<br>
Her people out upon her; and Antony,<br>
Enthroned i&#8217; the market-place, did sit alone,<br>
Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,<br>
Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,<br>
And made a gap in nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Rare Egyptian!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,<br>
Invited her to supper: she replied,<br>
It should be better he became her guest;<br>
Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,<br>
Whom ne&#8217;er the word of &#8216;No&#8217; woman heard
speak,<br>
Being barber&#8217;d ten times o&#8217;er, goes to the feast,<br>
And for his ordinary pays his heart<br>
For what his eyes eat only.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Royal wench!<br>
She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:<br>
He plough&#8217;d her, and she cropp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I saw her once<br>
Hop forty paces through the public street;<br>
And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,<br>
That she did make defect perfection,<br>
And, breathless, power breathe forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Now Antony must leave her utterly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Never; he will not:<br>
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale<br>
Her infinite variety: other women cloy<br>
The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry<br>
Where most she satisfies; for vilest things<br>
Become themselves in her: that the holy priests<br>
Bless her when she is riggish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle<br>
The heart of Antony, Octavia is<br>
A blessed lottery to him.</p>

Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar&#8217;s or mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar&#8217;s.<br>
Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:<br>
Thy demon, that&#8217;s thy spirit which keeps thee, is<br>
Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,<br>
Where Caesar&#8217;s is not; but, near him, thy angel<br>
Becomes a fear, as being o&#8217;erpower&#8217;d: therefore<br>
Make space enough between you.</p>

<p class="speech">To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.<br>
If thou dost play with him at any game,<br>
Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,<br>
He beats thee &#8217;gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,<br>
When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit<br>
Is all afraid to govern thee near him;<br>
But, he away, &#8217;tis noble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>

Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:</p>

<p class="speech">He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,<br>
He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;<br>
And in our sports my better cunning faints<br>
Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;<br>
His cocks do win the battle still of mine,<br>
When it is all to nought; and his quails ever<br>
Beat mine, inhoop&#8217;d, at odds. I will to Egypt:<br>
And though I make this marriage for my peace,<br>
I&#8217; the east my pleasure lies.</p>

<p class="speech">True, sir; she was the wife of Caius
Marcellus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Pray ye, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>

<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">If I were bound to divine of this unity, I
would
not prophesy so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">I think the policy of that purpose made more in
the
marriage than the love of the parties.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">I think so too. But you shall find, the band
that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">Who would not have his wife so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark
Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menas</p>
<p class="speech">And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you
aboard?<br>
I have a health for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>

Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you<br>
But when you are well pleased.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That Herod&#8217;s head<br>
I&#8217;ll have: but how, when Antony is gone<br>
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, in Rome;<br>
I look&#8217;d her in the face, and saw her led<br>
Between her brother and Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Is she as tall as me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">She is not, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>

low?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not so good: he cannot like her
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Like her! O Isis! &#8217;tis impossible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and
dwarfish!<br>
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,<br>
If e&#8217;er thou look&#8217;dst on majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">She creeps:<br>
Her motion and her station are as one;<br>
She shows a body rather than a life,<br>
A statue than a breather.</p>

The fellow has good judgment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>

<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">For the most part, too, they are foolish that are
so.<br>
Her hair, what colour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Brown, madam: and her forehead<br>
As low as she would wish it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s gold for thee.<br>
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:<br>

<p class="speech">I have one thing more to ask him yet, good
Charmian:<br>
But &#8217;tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me<br>

To public ear:<br>
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not<br>
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly<br>
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:<br>
When the best hint was given him, he not took&#8217;t,<br>
Or did it from his teeth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">O my good lord,<br>
Believe not all; or, if you must believe,<br>

The good gods me presently,<br>

Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,<br>
&#8216;O, bless my brother!&#8217; Husband win, win brother,<br>
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway<br>
&#8217;Twixt these extremes at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle Octavia,<br>
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks<br>
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,<br>
I lose myself: better I were not yours<br>
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,<br>
Yourself shall go between &#8217;s: the mean time, lady,<br>
I&#8217;ll raise the preparation of a war<br>
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;<br>
So your desires are yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks to my lord.<br>
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,<br>
Your reconciler! Wars &#8217;twixt you twain would be<br>
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men<br>
Should solder up the rift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">When it appears to you where this begins,<br>
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults<br>
Can never be so equal, that your love<br>
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;<br>
Choose your own company, and command what cost<br>
Your heart has mind to.</p>

The neighs of horse to tell of her approach<br>
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way<br>
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,<br>
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust<br>
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,<br>
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come<br>
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented<br>
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,<br>

By sea and land; supplying every stage<br>
With an augmented greeting.</p>

To come thus was I not constrain&#8217;d, but did<br>
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,<br>

My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal<br>
And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were<br>
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar<br>
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;<br>
And to proclaim it civilly, were like<br>

Thou hast been whipp&#8217;d for following him: henceforth<br>
The white hand of a lady fever thee,<br>
Shake thou to look on &#8217;t. Get thee back to Caesar,<br>
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say<br>
He makes me angry with him; for he seems<br>
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,<br>
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;<br>
And at this time most easy &#8217;tis to do&#8217;t,<br>
When my good stars, that were my former guides,<br>
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires<br>
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike<br>
My speech and what is done, tell him he has<br>
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom<br>
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,<br>

From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,<br>
And poison it in the source; and the first stone<br>
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so<br>
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!<br>
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,<br>

Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where<br>
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land<br>

Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?<br>
If from the field I shall return once more<br>

And fight maliciously: for when mine hours<br>
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives<br>
Of me for jests; but now I&#8217;ll set my teeth,<br>
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,<br>
Let&#8217;s have one other gaudy night: call to me<br>
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;<br>

The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,<br>
A diminution in our captain&#8217;s brain<br>
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,<br>
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek<br>

Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw&#8212;<br>
Which never shall be found&#8212;you did suspect<br>
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage<br>
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;<br>
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent<br>
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,<br>

Not by a public minister of justice,<br>

And Antony, were nature&#8217;s piece &#8217;gainst fancy,<br>
Condemning shadows quite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, good madam.<br>
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it<br>
As answering to the weight: would I might never<br>
O&#8217;ertake pursued success, but I do feel,<br>
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites<br>
My very heart at root.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, sir,<br>
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, pray you, sir,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Though he be honourable,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll lead me, then, in triumph?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he will; I know&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish, and shout within,
&#8216;Make way there: Octavius Caesar!&#8217;</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Octavius Caesar,
Gallus, Proculeius, Mecaenas, Seleucus, and others of his
Train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Which is the Queen of Egypt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">It is the emperor, madam.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Cleopatra kneels</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Arise, you shall not kneel:<br>
I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, the gods<br>
Will have it thus; my master and my lord<br>
I must obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Take to you no hard thoughts:<br>
The record of what injuries you did us,<br>
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember<br>
As things but done by chance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Sole sir o&#8217; the world,<br>
I cannot project mine own cause so well<br>
To make it clear; but do confess I have<br>
Been laden with like frailties which before<br>
Have often shamed our sex.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Cleopatra, know,<br>
We will extenuate rather than enforce:<br>
If you apply yourself to our intents,<br>
Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find<br>
A benefit in this change; but if you seek<br>
To lay on me a cruelty, by taking<br>
Antony&#8217;s course, you shall bereave yourself<br>
Of my good purposes, and put your children<br>
To that destruction which I&#8217;ll guard them from,<br>
If thereon you rely. I&#8217;ll take my leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">And may, through all the world: &#8217;tis yours;
and we,<br>
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall<br>
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">This is the brief of money, plate, and
jewels,<br>
I am possess&#8217;d of: &#8217;tis exactly valued;<br>
Not petty things admitted. Where&#8217;s Seleucus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Seleucus</p>
<p class="speech">Here, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,<br>
Upon his peril, that I have reserved<br>
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Seleucus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam,<br>
I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,<br>
Speak that which is not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">What have I kept back?</p>
<p class="speaker">Seleucus</p>
<p class="speech">Enough to purchase what you have made known.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve<br>
Your wisdom in the deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">See, Caesar! O, behold,<br>
How pomp is follow&#8217;d! mine will now be yours;<br>
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.<br>
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does<br>
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust<br>
Than love that&#8217;s hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt<br>
Go back, I warrant thee; but I&#8217;ll catch thine eyes,<br>
Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!<br>
O rarely base!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Good queen, let us entreat you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,<br>
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,<br>
Doing the honour of thy lordliness<br>
To one so meek, that mine own servant should<br>
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by<br>
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,<br>
That I some lady trifles have reserved,<br>
Immoment toys, things of such dignity<br>
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,<br>
Some nobler token I have kept apart<br>
For Livia and Octavia, to induce<br>
Their mediation; must I be unfolded<br>
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me<br>
Beneath the fall I have.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Seleucus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, go hence;<br>
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits<br>
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,<br>
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear, Seleucus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Seleucus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Be it known, that we, the greatest, are
misthought<br>
For things that others do; and, when we fall,<br>
We answer others&#8217; merits in our name,<br>
Are therefore to be pitied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Cleopatra,<br>
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,<br>
Put we i&#8217; the roll of conquest: still be&#8217;t yours,<br>
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,<br>
Caesar&#8217;s no merchant, to make prize with you<br>
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer&#8217;d;<br>
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;<br>
For we intend so to dispose you as<br>
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:<br>
Our care and pity is so much upon you,<br>
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">My master, and my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Not so. Adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Exeunt Octavius
Caesar and his train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">He words me, girls, he words me, that I should
not<br>
Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Whispers Charmian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,<br>
And we are for the dark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Hie thee again:<br>
I have spoke already, and it is provided;<br>
Go put it to the haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Dolabella</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Behold, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Dolabella!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,<br>
Which my love makes religion to obey,<br>
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria<br>
Intends his journey; and within three days<br>
You with your children will he send before:<br>
Make your best use of this: I have perform&#8217;d<br>
Your pleasure and my promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Dolabella,<br>
I shall remain your debtor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">I your servant,<br>
Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, and thanks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Dolabella</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, Iras, what think&#8217;st thou?<br>
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown<br>
In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves<br>
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall<br>
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,<br>
Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,<br>
And forced to drink their vapour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">The gods forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;tis most certain, Iras: saucy
lictors<br>
Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers<br>
Ballad us out o&#8217; tune: the quick comedians<br>
Extemporally will stage us, and present<br>
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony<br>
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see<br>
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness<br>
I&#8217; the posture of a whore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">O the good gods!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s certain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iras</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll never see &#8217;t; for, I am sure, my
nails<br>
Are stronger than mine eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that&#8217;s the way<br>
To fool their preparation, and to conquer<br>
Their most absurd intents.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Charmian</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, Charmian!<br>
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch<br>
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,<br>
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.<br>
Now, noble Charmian, we&#8217;ll dispatch indeed;<br>
And, when thou hast done this chare, I&#8217;ll give thee leave<br>
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.<br>
Wherefore&#8217;s this noise?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Iras. A noise
within</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Guardsman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Guard</p>
<p class="speech">Here is a rural fellow<br>
That will not be denied your highness presence:<br>
He brings you figs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Let him come in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Guardsman</span></p>
<p class="speech">What poor an instrument<br>
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.<br>
My resolution&#8217;s placed, and I have nothing<br>
Of woman in me: now from head to foot<br>
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon<br>
No planet is of mine.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Guardsman, with
Clown bringing in a basket</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Guard</p>
<p class="speech">This is the man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Avoid, and leave him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Guardsman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,<br>
That kills and pains not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I have him: but I would not be the
party
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Rememberest thou any that have died
on&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Very many, men and women too. I heard of one
of
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
but something given to lie; as a woman should not
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
a very good report o&#8217; the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
worm&#8217;s an odd worm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Get thee hence; farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I wish you all joy of the worm.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Setting down his
basket</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">You must think this, look you, that the worm
will
do his kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay; farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in
the
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
goodness in worm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it
is
not worth the feeding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Will it eat me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">You must not think I am so simple but I know
the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make, the devils mar five.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Well, get thee gone; farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o&#8217; the
worm.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Iras with a robe,
crown, &amp; c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have<br>
Immortal longings in me: now no more<br>
The juice of Egypt&#8217;s grape shall moist this lip:<br>
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear<br>
Antony call; I see him rouse himself<br>
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock<br>
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men<br>
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:<br>
Now to that name my courage prove my title!<br>
I am fire and air; my other elements<br>
I give to baser life. So; have you done?<br>
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.<br>
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kisses them. Iras falls and
dies</span></p>
<p class="speech">Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?<br>
If thou and nature can so gently part,<br>
The stroke of death is as a lover&#8217;s pinch,<br>
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?<br>
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell&#8217;st the world<br>
It is not worth leave-taking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may
say,<br>
The gods themselves do weep!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">This proves me base:<br>
If she first meet the curled Antony,<br>
He&#8217;ll make demand of her, and spend that kiss<br>
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
mortal wretch,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To an asp, which she applies
to her breast</span></p>
<p class="speech">With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate<br>
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool<br>
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,<br>
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass<br>
Unpolicied!</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O eastern star!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, peace!<br>
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,<br>
That sucks the nurse asleep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">O, break! O, break!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as
gentle,&#8212;<br>
O Antony!&#8212;Nay, I will take thee too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Applying another asp to her
arm</span></p>
<p class="speech">What should I stay&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">In this vile world? So, fare thee well.<br>
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies<br>
A lass unparallel&#8217;d. Downy windows, close;<br>
And golden Phoebus never be beheld<br>
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown&#8217;s awry;<br>
I&#8217;ll mend it, and then play.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Guard, rushing
in</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Speak softly, wake her not.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar hath sent&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Too slow a messenger.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Applies an asp</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">Approach, ho! All&#8217;s not well:
Caesar&#8217;s beguiled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Guard</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s Dolabella sent from Caesar; call
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">What work is here! Charmian, is this well
done?</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">It is well done, and fitting for a princess<br>
Descended of so many royal kings.<br>
Ah, soldier!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Dolabella</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">How goes it here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Guard</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;All dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, thy thoughts<br>
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming<br>
To see perform&#8217;d the dreaded act which thou<br>
So sought&#8217;st to hinder.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> &#8216;A way there, a
way for Caesar!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Octavius Caesar and
all his train marching</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, you are too sure an augurer;<br>
That you did fear is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Bravest at the last,<br>
She levell&#8217;d at our purposes, and, being royal,<br>
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?<br>
I do not see them bleed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Who was last with them?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">A simple countryman, that brought her figs:<br>
This was his basket.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Poison&#8217;d, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">O Caesar,<br>
This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:<br>
I found her trimming up the diadem<br>
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood<br>
And on the sudden dropp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">O noble weakness!<br>
If they had swallow&#8217;d poison, &#8217;twould appear<br>
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,<br>
As she would catch another Antony<br>
In her strong toil of grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dolabella</p>
<p class="speech">Here, on her breast,<br>
There is a vent of blood and something blown:<br>
The like is on her arm.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Guard</p>
<p class="speech">This is an aspic&#8217;s trail: and these
fig-leaves<br>
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves<br>
Upon the caves of Nile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Most probable<br>
That so she died; for her physician tells me<br>
She hath pursued conclusions infinite<br>
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;<br>
And bear her women from the monument:<br>
She shall be buried by her Antony:<br>
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it<br>
A pair so famous. High events as these<br>
Strike those that make them; and their story is<br>
No less in pity than his glory which<br>
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall<br>
In solemn show attend this funeral;<br>
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see<br>
High order in this great solemnity.</p>
