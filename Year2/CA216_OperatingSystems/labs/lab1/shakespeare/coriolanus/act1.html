<h4>Scene I. Rome. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a company of mutinous
Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You are all resolved rather to die than to
famish?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Resolved. resolved.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to
the people.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">We know&#8217;t, we know&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Let us kill him, and we&#8217;ll have corn at our
own price.<br>
Is&#8217;t a verdict?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">No more talking on&#8217;t; let it be done: away,
away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">One word, good citizens.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians
good.
What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
inventory to particularise their abundance; our
sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Would you proceed especially against Caius
Marcius?</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Against him first: he&#8217;s a very dog to the
commonalty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Consider you what services he has done for his
country?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Very well; and could be content to give him
good
report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but speak not maliciously.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he
did
it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
content to say it was for his country he did it to
please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
is, even till the altitude of his virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">What he cannot help in his nature, you account
a
vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If I must not, I need not be barren of
accusations;
he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Shouts within</span></p>
<p class="speech">What shouts are these? The other side o&#8217;
the city
is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Soft! who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Menenius
Agrippa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always
loved
the people.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s one honest enough: would all the rest
were so!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What work&#8217;s, my countrymen, in hand? where
go you<br>
With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Our business is not unknown to the senate; they
have
had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
which now we&#8217;ll show &#8217;em in deeds. They say poor
suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
have strong arms too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest
neighbours,<br>
Will you undo yourselves?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We cannot, sir, we are undone already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you, friends, most charitable care<br>
Have the patricians of you. For your wants,<br>
Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well<br>
Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them<br>
Against the Roman state, whose course will on<br>
The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs<br>
Of more strong link asunder than can ever<br>
Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,<br>
The gods, not the patricians, make it, and<br>
Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,<br>
You are transported by calamity<br>
Thither where more attends you, and you slander<br>
The helms o&#8217; the state, who care for you like fathers,<br>
When you curse them as enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Care for us! True, indeed! They ne&#8217;er cared
for us
yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
established against the rich, and provide more
piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
there&#8217;s all the love they bear us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Either you must<br>
Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,<br>
Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you<br>
A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;<br>
But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture<br>
To stale &#8217;t a little more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I&#8217;ll hear it, sir: yet you must not
think to
fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an &#8217;t please
you, deliver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">There was a time when all the body&#8217;s
members<br>
Rebell&#8217;d against the belly, thus accused it:<br>
That only like a gulf it did remain<br>
I&#8217; the midst o&#8217; the body, idle and unactive,<br>
Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing<br>
Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments<br>
Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,<br>
And, mutually participate, did minister<br>
Unto the appetite and affection common<br>
Of the whole body. The belly answer&#8217;d&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, what answer made the belly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,<br>
Which ne&#8217;er came from the lungs, but even thus&#8212;<br>
For, look you, I may make the belly smile<br>
As well as speak&#8212;it tauntingly replied<br>
To the discontented members, the mutinous parts<br>
That envied his receipt; even so most fitly<br>
As you malign our senators for that<br>
They are not such as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Your belly&#8217;s answer? What!<br>
The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,<br>
The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,<br>
Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.<br>
With other muniments and petty helps<br>
In this our fabric, if that they&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What then?<br>
&#8217;Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Should by the cormorant belly be
restrain&#8217;d,<br>
Who is the sink o&#8217; the body,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Well, what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">The former agents, if they did complain,<br>
What could the belly answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">I will tell you<br>
If you&#8217;ll bestow a small&#8212;of what you have
little&#8212;<br>
Patience awhile, you&#8217;ll hear the belly&#8217;s answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Ye&#8217;re long about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Note me this, good friend;<br>
Your most grave belly was deliberate,<br>
Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer&#8217;d:<br>
&#8216;True is it, my incorporate friends,&#8217; quoth he,<br>
&#8216;That I receive the general food at first,<br>
Which you do live upon; and fit it is,<br>
Because I am the store-house and the shop<br>
Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,<br>
I send it through the rivers of your blood,<br>
Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o&#8217; the brain;<br>
And, through the cranks and offices of man,<br>
The strongest nerves and small inferior veins<br>
From me receive that natural competency<br>
Whereby they live: and though that all at once,<br>
You, my good friends,&#8217;&#8212;this says the belly, mark
me,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; well, well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Though all at once cannot<br>
See what I do deliver out to each,<br>
Yet I can make my audit up, that all<br>
From me do back receive the flour of all,<br>
And leave me but the bran.&#8217; What say you to&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">It was an answer: how apply you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Rome are this good belly,<br>
And you the mutinous members; for examine<br>
Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly<br>
Touching the weal o&#8217; the common, you shall find<br>
No public benefit which you receive<br>
But it proceeds or comes from them to you<br>
And no way from yourselves. What do you think,<br>
You, the great toe of this assembly?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">I the great toe! why the great toe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">For that, being one o&#8217; the lowest, basest,
poorest,<br>
Of this most wise rebellion, thou go&#8217;st foremost:<br>
Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,<br>
Lead&#8217;st first to win some vantage.<br>
But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:<br>
Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;<br>
The one side must have bale.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Caius
Marcius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hail, noble Marcius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks. What&#8217;s the matter, you dissentious
rogues,<br>
That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,<br>
Make yourselves scabs?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We have ever your good word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">He that will give good words to thee will
flatter<br>
Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,<br>
That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,<br>
The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,<br>
Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;<br>
Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,<br>
Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,<br>
Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is<br>
To make him worthy whose offence subdues him<br>
And curse that justice did it.<br>
Who deserves greatness<br>
Deserves your hate; and your affections are<br>
A sick man&#8217;s appetite, who desires most that<br>
Which would increase his evil. He that depends<br>
Upon your favours swims with fins of lead<br>
And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?<br>
With every minute you do change a mind,<br>
And call him noble that was now your hate,<br>
Him vile that was your garland. What&#8217;s the matter,<br>
That in these several places of the city<br>
You cry against the noble senate, who,<br>
Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else<br>
Would feed on one another? What&#8217;s their seeking?</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">For corn at their own rates; whereof, they
say,<br>
The city is well stored.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Hang &#8217;em! They say!<br>
They&#8217;ll sit by the fire, and presume to know<br>
What&#8217;s done i&#8217; the Capitol; who&#8217;s like to
rise,<br>
Who thrives and who declines; side factions
and give out<br>
Conjectural marriages; making parties strong<br>
And feebling such as stand not in their liking<br>
Below their cobbled shoes. They say there&#8217;s
grain enough!<br>
Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,<br>
And let me use my sword, I&#8217;ll make a quarry<br>
With thousands of these quarter&#8217;d slaves, as high<br>
As I could pick my lance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;<br>
For though abundantly they lack discretion,<br>
Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,<br>
What says the other troop?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">They are dissolved: hang &#8217;em!<br>
They said they were an-hungry; sigh&#8217;d forth proverbs,<br>
That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,<br>
That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not<br>
Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds<br>
They vented their complainings; which being answer&#8217;d,<br>
And a petition granted them, a strange one&#8212;<br>
To break the heart of generosity,<br>
And make bold power look pale&#8212;they threw their caps<br>
As they would hang them on the horns o&#8217; the moon,<br>
Shouting their emulation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">What is granted them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,<br>
Of their own choice: one&#8217;s Junius Brutus,<br>
Sicinius Velutus, and I know not&#8212;&#8217;sdeath!<br>
The rabble should have first unroof&#8217;d the city,<br>
Ere so prevail&#8217;d with me: it will in time<br>
Win upon power and throw forth greater themes<br>
For insurrection&#8217;s arguing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">This is strange.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Go, get you home, you fragments!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger,
hastily</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Caius Marcius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Here: what&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad on &#8217;t: then we shall ha&#8217;
means to vent<br>
Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cominius, Titus
Lartius, and other Senators; Junius Brutus and Sicinius
Velutus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Marcius, &#8217;tis true that you have lately
told us;<br>
The Volsces are in arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">They have a leader,<br>
Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to &#8217;t.<br>
I sin in envying his nobility,<br>
And were I any thing but what I am,<br>
I would wish me only he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">You have fought together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Were half to half the world by the ears and
he.<br>
Upon my party, I&#8217;ld revolt to make<br>
Only my wars with him: he is a lion<br>
That I am proud to hunt.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Then, worthy Marcius,<br>
Attend upon Cominius to these wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">It is your former promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is;<br>
And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou<br>
Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus&#8217; face.<br>
What, art thou stiff? stand&#8217;st out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Caius Marcius;<br>
I&#8217;ll lean upon one crutch and fight with t&#8217;other,<br>
Ere stay behind this business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">O, true-bred!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,<br>
Our greatest friends attend us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Cominius]</span> Lead you
on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Marcius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Right worthy you priority.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Marcius!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To the Citizens]</span>
Hence to your homes; be gone!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let them follow:<br>
The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither<br>
To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,<br>
Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Citizens steal away. Exeunt
all but Sicinius and Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He has no equal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">When we were chosen tribunes for the
people,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark&#8217;d you his lip and eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Nay. but his taunts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Being moved, he will not spare to gird the
gods.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Be-mock the modest moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">The present wars devour him: he is grown<br>
Too proud to be so valiant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Such a nature,<br>
Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow<br>
Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder<br>
His insolence can brook to be commanded<br>
Under Cominius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Fame, at the which he aims,<br>
In whom already he&#8217;s well graced, can not<br>
Better be held nor more attain&#8217;d than by<br>
A place below the first: for what miscarries<br>
Shall be the general&#8217;s fault, though he perform<br>
To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure<br>
Will then cry out of Marcius &#8216;O if he<br>
Had borne the business!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Besides, if things go well,<br>
Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall<br>
Of his demerits rob Cominius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Come:<br>
Half all Cominius&#8217; honours are to Marcius.<br>
Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults<br>
To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed<br>
In aught he merit not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s hence, and hear<br>
How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,<br>
More than his singularity, he goes<br>
Upon this present action.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Lets along.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tullus Aufidius and
certain Senators</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">So, your opinion is, Aufidius,<br>
That they of Rome are entered in our counsels<br>
And know how we proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Is it not yours?<br>
What ever have been thought on in this state,<br>
That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome<br>
Had circumvention? &#8217;Tis not four days gone<br>
Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think<br>
I have the letter here; yes, here it is.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;They have press&#8217;d a power, but it is
not known<br>

Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,<br>
Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,<br>
And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,<br>
These three lead on this preparation<br>

Consider of it.&#8217;</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Our army&#8217;s in the field<br>

To keep your great pretences veil&#8217;d till when<br>
They needs must show themselves; which
in the hatching,<br>

We shall be shorten&#8217;d in our aim, which was<br>
To take in many towns ere almost Rome<br>

Take your commission; hie you to your bands:<br>

<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself
in a
more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
he would show most love. When yet he was but
tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
for a day of kings&#8217; entreaties a mother should not
sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
how honour would become such a person. that it was
no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">But had he died in the business, madam; how
then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Then his good report should have been my son;
I
therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
alike and none less dear than thine and my good
Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.</p>

<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, you shall not.<br>
Methinks I hear hither your husband&#8217;s drum,<br>
See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,<br>
As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:<br>
Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:<br>
&#8216;Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,<br>
Though you were born in Rome:&#8217; his bloody brow<br>
With his mail&#8217;d hand then wiping, forth he goes,<br>
Like to a harvest-man that&#8217;s task&#8217;d to mow<br>
Or all or lose his hire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Away, you fool! it more becomes a man<br>
Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,<br>
When she did suckle Hector, look&#8217;d not lovelier<br>
Than Hector&#8217;s forehead when it spit forth blood<br>
At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,<br>
We are fit to bid her welcome.</p>

<p class="speech">I am glad to see your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">How do you both? you are manifest
house-keepers.
What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
faith. How does your little son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum,
than
look upon his school-master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">O&#8217; my word, the father&#8217;s son:
I&#8217;ll swear,&#8217;tis a
very pretty boy. O&#8217; my troth, I looked upon him o&#8217;
Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
again; and after it again; and over and over he
comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
fall enraged him, or how &#8217;twas, he did so set his
teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>

<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, la, &#8217;tis a noble child.</p>

<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you
play
the idle husewife with me this afternoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">No, good madam; I will not out of doors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">Not out of doors!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">She shall, she shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, no, by your patience; I&#8217;ll not over
the
threshold till my lord return from the wars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably:
come,
you must go visit the good lady that lies in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her
with
my prayers; but I cannot go thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not to save labour, nor that I want
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">You would be another Penelope: yet, they say,
all
the yarn she spun in Ulysses&#8217; absence did but fill
Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not
forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">In truth, la, go with me; and I&#8217;ll tell
you
excellent news of your husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">O, good madam, there can be none yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news
from
him last night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">In earnest, it&#8217;s true; I heard a senator
speak it.
Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in
every
thing hereafter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will
but
disease our better mirth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>
<p class="speech">In troth, I think she would. Fare you well,
then.
Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
solemness out o&#8217; door. and go along with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I
wish
you much mirth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valeria</p>

<p class="speech">O, they are at it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lartius</p>
<p class="speech">Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the army of the
Volsces</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">They fear us not, but issue forth their city.<br>
Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight<br>
With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
brave Titus:<br>
They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,<br>
Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:<br>
He that retires I&#8217;ll take him for a Volsce,<br>
And he shall feel mine edge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum. The Romans are beat
back to their trenches. Re-enter Marcius cursing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">All the contagion of the south light on you,<br>
You shames of Rome! you herd of&#8212;Boils and plagues<br>
Plaster you o&#8217;er, that you may be abhorr&#8217;d<br>
Further than seen and one infect another<br>
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,<br>
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run<br>
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!<br>
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale<br>
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,<br>
Or, by the fires of heaven, I&#8217;ll leave the foe<br>
And make my wars on you: look to&#8217;t: come on;<br>
If you&#8217;ll stand fast, we&#8217;ll beat them to their

To answer all the city.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lartius</p>
<p class="speech">O noble fellow!<br>
Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,<br>
And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:<br>
A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,<br>
Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier<br>
Even to Cato&#8217;s wish, not fierce and terrible<br>
Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and<br>
The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,<br>
Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world<br>
Were feverous and did tremble.</p>

Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.</p>

<h4>Scene VIII. A field of battle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum as in battle. Enter,
from opposite sides, Marcius and Aufidius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll fight with none but thee; for I do
hate thee<br>
Worse than a promise-breaker.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">We hate alike:<br>
Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor<br>
More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Let the first budger die the other&#8217;s
slave,<br>
And the gods doom him after!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">If I fly, Marcius,<br>
Holloa me like a hare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Within these three hours, Tullus,<br>
Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,<br>
And made what work I pleased: &#8217;tis not my blood<br>
Wherein thou seest me mask&#8217;d; for thy revenge<br>
Wrench up thy power to the highest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Wert thou the Hector<br>
That was the whip of your bragg&#8217;d progeny,<br>
Thou shouldst not scape me here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight, and certain
Volsces come to the aid of Aufidius. Marcius fights till they be
driven in breathless</span></p>
<p class="speech">Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed
me<br>
In your condemned seconds.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<div id="act1.9" class="scene" title="Scene IX. The Roman camp.">
<h4>Scene IX. The Roman camp.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Alarum. A retreat
is sounded. Flourish. Enter, from one side, Cominius with the
Romans; from the other side, Marcius, with his arm in a
scarf</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">If I should tell thee o&#8217;er this thy
day&#8217;s work,<br>
Thou&#8217;ldst not believe thy deeds: but I&#8217;ll report it<br>
Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,<br>
Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,<br>
I&#8217; the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,<br>
And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
dull tribunes,<br>
That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,<br>
Shall say against their hearts &#8216;We thank the gods<br>
Our Rome hath such a soldier.&#8217;<br>
Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,<br>
Having fully dined before.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus Lartius, with his
power, from the pursuit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lartius</p>
<p class="speech">O general,<br>
Here is the steed, we the caparison:<br>
Hadst thou beheld&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">Pray now, no more: my mother,<br>
Who has a charter to extol her blood,<br>
When she does praise me grieves me. I have done<br>
As you have done; that&#8217;s what I can; induced<br>
As you have been; that&#8217;s for my country:<br>
He that has but effected his good will<br>
Hath overta&#8217;en mine act.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not be<br>
The grave of your deserving; Rome must know<br>
The value of her own: &#8217;twere a concealment<br>
Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,<br>
To hide your doings; and to silence that,<br>
Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch&#8217;d,<br>
Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you<br>
In sign of what you are, not to reward<br>
What you have done&#8212;before our army hear me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">I have some wounds upon me, and they smart<br>
To hear themselves remember&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Should they not,<br>
Well might they fester &#8217;gainst ingratitude,<br>
And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,<br>
Whereof we have ta&#8217;en good and good store, of all<br>
The treasure in this field achieved and city,<br>
We render you the tenth, to be ta&#8217;en forth,<br>
Before the common distribution, at<br>
Your only choice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I thank you, general;<br>
But cannot make my heart consent to take<br>
A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;<br>
And stand upon my common part with those<br>
That have beheld the doing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A long flourish. They all cry
&#8216;Marcius! Marcius!&#8217; cast up their caps and lances:
Cominius and Lartius stand bare</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcius</p>
<p class="speech">May these same instruments, which you
profane,<br>
Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall<br>
I&#8217; the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be<br>
Made all of false-faced soothing!<br>
When steel grows soft as the parasite&#8217;s silk,<br>
Let him be made a coverture for the wars!<br>
No more, I say! For that I have not wash&#8217;d<br>
My nose that bled, or foil&#8217;d some debile wretch.&#8212;<br>
Which, without note, here&#8217;s many else have done,&#8212;<br>
You shout me forth<br>
In acclamations hyperbolical;<br>
As if I loved my little should be dieted<br>
In praises sauced with lies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Too modest are you;<br>
More cruel to your good report than grateful<br>
To us that give you truly: by your patience,<br>
If &#8217;gainst yourself you be incensed, we&#8217;ll put you,<br>
Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,<br>
Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,<br>
As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius<br>
Wears this war&#8217;s garland: in token of the which,<br>
My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,<br>
With all his trim belonging; and from this time,<br>
For what he did before Corioli, call him,<br>
With all the applause and clamour of the host,<br>
Caius Marcius Coriolanus! Bear<br>
The addition nobly ever!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Trumpets sound, and
drums</span></p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Caius Marcius Coriolanus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">I will go wash;<br>
And when my face is fair, you shall perceive<br>
Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.<br>
I mean to stride your steed, and at all times<br>
To undercrest your good addition<br>
To the fairness of my power.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">So, to our tent;<br>
Where, ere we do repose us, we will write<br>
To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,<br>
Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome<br>
The best, with whom we may articulate,<br>
For their own good and ours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lartius</p>
<p class="speech">I shall, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">The gods begin to mock me. I, that now<br>
Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg<br>
Of my lord general.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Take&#8217;t; &#8217;tis yours. What
is&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">I sometime lay here in Corioli<br>
At a poor man&#8217;s house; he used me kindly:<br>
He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;<br>
But then Aufidius was with in my view,<br>
And wrath o&#8217;erwhelm&#8217;d my pity: I request you<br>
To give my poor host freedom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">O, well begg&#8217;d!<br>
Were he the butcher of my son, he should<br>
Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lartius</p>
<p class="speech">Marcius, his name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By Jupiter! forgot.<br>
I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.<br>
Have we no wine here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Go we to our tent:<br>
The blood upon your visage dries; &#8217;tis time<br>
It should be look&#8217;d to: come.</p>

<h4>Scene X. The camp of the Volsces.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A flourish. Cornets. Enter
Tullus Aufidius, bloody, with two or three Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">The town is ta&#8217;en!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twill be deliver&#8217;d back on good
condition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Condition!<br>
I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,<br>
Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!<br>
What good condition can a treaty find<br>
I&#8217; the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,<br>
I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,<br>
And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter<br>
As often as we eat. By the elements,<br>
If e&#8217;er again I meet him beard to beard,<br>
He&#8217;s mine, or I am his: mine emulation<br>
Hath not that honour in&#8217;t it had; for where<br>
I thought to crush him in an equal force,<br>
True sword to sword, I&#8217;ll potch at him some way<br>
Or wrath or craft may get him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour&#8217;s
poison&#8217;d<br>
With only suffering stain by him; for him<br>
Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,<br>
Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,<br>
The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,<br>
Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up<br>
Their rotten privilege and custom &#8217;gainst<br>
My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it<br>
At home, upon my brother&#8217;s guard, even there,<br>
Against the hospitable canon, would I<br>
Wash my fierce hand in&#8217;s heart. Go you to the city;<br>
Learn how &#8217;tis held; and what they are that must<br>
Be hostages for Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">Will not you go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray
you&#8212;<br>
&#8217;Tis south the city mills&#8212;bring me word thither<br>
How the world goes, that to the pace of it<br>
I may spur on my journey.</p>
