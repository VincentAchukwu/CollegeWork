<h4>Scene I. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Second Merchant,
Angelo, and an Officer</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">You know since Pentecost the sum is due,<br>
And since I have not much importuned you;<br>
Nor now I had not, but that I am bound<br>
To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:<br>
Therefore make present satisfaction,<br>
Or I&#8217;ll attach you by this officer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Even just the sum that I do owe to you<br>
Is growing to me by Antipholus,<br>
And in the instant that I met with you<br>
He had of me a chain: at five o&#8217;clock<br>
I shall receive the money for the same.<br>
Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,<br>
I will discharge my bond and thank you too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antipholus of Ephesus
and Dromio of Ephesus from the courtezan&#8217;s</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">That labour may you save: see where he comes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">While I go to the goldsmith&#8217;s house, go
thou<br>
And buy a rope&#8217;s end: that will I bestow<br>
Among my wife and her confederates,<br>
For locking me out of my doors by day.<br>
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;<br>
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">A man is well holp up that trusts to you:<br>
I promised your presence and the chain;<br>
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.<br>
Belike you thought our love would last too long,<br>
If it were chain&#8217;d together, and therefore came not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Saving your merry humour, here&#8217;s the
note<br>
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,<br>
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.<br>
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more<br>
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:<br>
I pray you, see him presently discharged,<br>
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I am not furnish&#8217;d with the present
money;<br>
Besides, I have some business in the town.<br>
Good signior, take the stranger to my house<br>
And with you take the chain and bid my wife<br>
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:<br>
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Then you will bring the chain to her
yourself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">No; bear it with you, lest I come not time
enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;<br>
Or else you may return without your money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the
chain:<br>
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,<br>
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse<br>
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.<br>
I should have chid you for not bringing it,<br>
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">The hour steals on; I pray you, sir,
dispatch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You hear how he importunes me;&#8212;the
chain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.<br>
Either send the chain or send me by some token.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
where&#8217;s the chain? I pray you, let me see it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">My business cannot brook this dalliance.<br>
Good sir, say whether you&#8217;ll answer me or no:<br>
If not, I&#8217;ll leave him to the officer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I answer you! what should I answer you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">The money that you owe me for the chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I owe you none till I receive the chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You know I gave it you half an hour since.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">You gave me none: you wrong me much to say
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:<br>
Consider how it stands upon my credit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">I do; and charge you in the duke&#8217;s name to
obey me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">This touches me in reputation.<br>
Either consent to pay this sum for me<br>
Or I attach you by this officer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Consent to pay thee that I never had!<br>
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,<br>
I would not spare my brother in this case,<br>
If he should scorn me so apparently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I do obey thee till I give thee bail.<br>
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear<br>
As all the metal in your shop will answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Angelo</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,<br>
To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dromio of Syracuse,
from the bay</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum<br>
That stays but till her owner comes aboard,<br>
And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,<br>
I have convey&#8217;d aboard; and I have bought<br>
The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.<br>
The ship is in her trim; the merry wind<br>
Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all<br>
But for their owner, master, and yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,<br>
What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;<br>
And told thee to what purpose and what end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">You sent me for a rope&#8217;s end as soon:<br>
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I will debate this matter at more leisure<br>
And teach your ears to list me with more heed.<br>
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:<br>
Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk<br>
That&#8217;s cover&#8217;d o&#8217;er with Turkish tapestry,<br>
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:<br>
Tell her I am arrested in the street<br>
And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!<br>
On, officer, to prison till it come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Second Merchant,
Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">To Adriana! that is where we dined,<br>
Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:<br>
She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.<br>
Thither I must, although against my will,<br>
For servants must their masters&#8217; minds fulfil.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The house of Antipholus of Ephesus.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Adriana and
Luciana</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?<br>
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye<br>
That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?<br>
Look&#8217;d he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?<br>
What observation madest thou in this case<br>
Of his heart&#8217;s meteors tilting in his face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">First he denied you had in him no right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">He meant he did me none; the more my spite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Then swore he that he was a stranger here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">And true he swore, though yet forsworn he
were.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Then pleaded I for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">And what said he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">That love I begg&#8217;d for you he begg&#8217;d
of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">With words that in an honest suit might move.<br>
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Didst speak him fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, I beseech.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;<br>
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.<br>
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,<br>
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;<br>
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;<br>
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Who would be jealous then of such a one?<br>
No evil lost is wail&#8217;d when it is gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, but I think him better than I say,<br>
And yet would herein others&#8217; eyes were worse.<br>
Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:<br>
My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dromio of
Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make
haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">How hast thou lost thy breath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">By running fast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, he&#8217;s in Tartar limbo, worse than
hell.<br>
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;<br>
One whose hard heart is button&#8217;d up with steel;<br>
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;<br>
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;<br>
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
countermands<br>
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;<br>
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;<br>
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, what is the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know the matter: he is &#8217;rested on
the case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;<br>
But he&#8217;s in a suit of buff which &#8217;rested him, that can
I tell.<br>
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Go fetch it, sister.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Luciana</span></p>
<p class="speech">This I wonder at,<br>
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.<br>
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;<br>
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">What, the chain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No, no, the bell: &#8217;tis time that I were
gone:<br>
It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
strikes one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">The hours come back! that did I never hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a&#8217;
turns back for
very fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou
reason!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than
he&#8217;s
worth, to season.<br>
Nay, he&#8217;s a thief too: have you not heard men say<br>
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?<br>
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,<br>
Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Luciana with a
purse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Dromio; there&#8217;s the money, bear it
straight;<br>
And bring thy master home immediately.<br>
Come, sister: I am press&#8217;d down with conceit&#8212;<br>
Conceit, my comfort and my injury.</p>

Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s not a man I meet but doth salute
me<br>
As if I were their well-acquainted friend;<br>
And every one doth call me by my name.<br>
Some tender money to me; some invite me;<br>
Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;<br>
Some offer me commodities to buy:<br>
Even now a tailor call&#8217;d me in his shop<br>
And show&#8217;d me silks that he had bought for me,<br>
And therewithal took measure of my body.<br>
Sure, these are but imaginary wiles<br>
And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Dromio Of
Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, here&#8217;s the gold you sent me for.
What, have
you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that
Adam
that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf&#8217;s
skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
forsake your liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I understand thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">No? why, &#8217;tis a plain case: he that went,
like a
bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
and &#8216;rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
morris-pike.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">What, thou meanest an officer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that
brings
any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
thinks a man always going to bed, and says, &#8216;God
give you good rest!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there
any</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that
the
bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
deliver you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">The fellow is distract, and so am I;<br>
And here we wander in illusions:<br>
Some blessed power deliver us from hence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Courtezan</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.<br>
I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:<br>
Is that the chain you promised me to-day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, is this Mistress Satan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">It is the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, she is worse, she is the devil&#8217;s dam;
and here
she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
comes that the wenches say &#8216;God damn me;&#8217; that&#8217;s
as
much to say &#8216;God make me a light wench.&#8217; It is
written, they appear to men like angels of light:
light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.<br>
Will you go with me? We&#8217;ll mend our dinner here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak
a
long spoon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Dromio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat
with
the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Avoid then, fiend! what tell&#8217;st thou me of
supping?<br>
Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:<br>
I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,<br>
Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Some devils ask but the parings of one&#8217;s
nail,<br>
A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,<br>
A nut, a cherry-stone;<br>
But she, more covetous, would have a chain.<br>
Master, be wise: an if you give it her,<br>
The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:<br>
I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>

mistress, that you know.</p>

<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,<br>
Else would he never so demean himself.<br>
A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,<br>
And for the same he promised me a chain:<br>
Both one and other he denies me now.<br>
The reason that I gather he is mad,<br>
Besides this present instance of his rage,<br>
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,<br>
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.<br>
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,<br>
On purpose shut the doors against his way.<br>
My way is now to hie home to his house,<br>
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,<br>
He rush&#8217;d into my house and took perforce<br>
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;<br>
For forty ducats is too much to lose.</p>

<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beating him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, be patient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;tis for me to be patient; I am in
adversity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Good, now, hold thy tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou whoreson, senseless villain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not
feel
your blows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is
an
ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my
long
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Adriana, Luciana, the
Courtezan, and Pinch</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress, &#8216;respice finem,&#8217; respect
your end; or
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, &#8216;beware the
rope&#8217;s-end.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou still talk?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beating him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">How say you now? is not your husband mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">His incivility confirms no less.<br>
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;<br>
Establish him in his true sense again,<br>
And I will please you what you will demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Striking him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,<br>
To yield possession to my holy prayers<br>
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:<br>
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">You minion, you, are these your customers?<br>
Did this companion with the saffron face<br>
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,<br>
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut<br>
And I denied to enter in my house?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">O husband, God doth know you dined at home;<br>
Where would you had remain&#8217;d until this time,<br>
Free from these slanders and this open shame!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest
thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Were not my doors lock&#8217;d up and I shut
out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Perdie, your doors were lock&#8217;d and you shut
out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And did not she herself revile me there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn&#8217;d
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And did not I in rage depart from thence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">In verity you did; my bones bear witness,<br>
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t good to soothe him in these
contraries?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,<br>
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast suborn&#8217;d the goldsmith to arrest
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,<br>
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;<br>
But surely master, not a rag of money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Went&#8217;st not thou to her for a purse of
ducats?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">He came to me and I deliver&#8217;d it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">And I am witness with her that she did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">God and the rope-maker bear me witness<br>
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress, both man and master is
possess&#8217;d;<br>
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:<br>
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth
to-day?<br>
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">And, gentle master, I received no gold;<br>
But I confess, sir, that we were lock&#8217;d out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Dissembling villain, thou speak&#8217;st false in
both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;<br>
And art confederate with a damned pack<br>
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:<br>
But with these nails I&#8217;ll pluck out these false eyes<br>
That would behold in me this shameful sport.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter three or four, and
offer to bind him. He strives</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">More company! The fiend is strong within him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,<br>
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them<br>
To make a rescue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Masters, let him go<br>
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pinch</p>
<p class="speech">Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They offer to bind Dromio of
Ephesus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?<br>
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man<br>
Do outrage and displeasure to himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">He is my prisoner: if I let him go,<br>
The debt he owes will be required of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:<br>
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,<br>
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.<br>
Good master doctor, see him safe convey&#8217;d<br>
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">O most unhappy strumpet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Master, I am here entered in bond for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Ephesus</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good
master:
cry &#8216;The devil!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Adriana,
Luciana, Officer and Courtezan</span></p>
<p class="speech">Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">I know the man. What is the sum he owes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Two hundred ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">Say, how grows it due?</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Due for a chain your husband had of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Courtezan</p>
<p class="speech">When as your husband all in rage to-day<br>
Came to my house and took away my ring&#8212;<br>
The ring I saw upon his finger now&#8212;<br>
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">It may be so, but I did never see it.<br>
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:<br>
I long to know the truth hereof at large.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antipholus of Syracuse
with his rapier drawn, and Dromio of Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Luciana</p>
<p class="speech">God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Adriana</p>
<p class="speech">And come with naked swords.<br>
Let&#8217;s call more help to have them bound again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Officer</p>
<p class="speech">Away! they&#8217;ll kill us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Antipholus of
Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I see these witches are afraid of swords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">She that would be your wife now ran from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from
thence:<br>
I long that we were safe and sound aboard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dromio of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do
us
no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
turn witch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antipholus of Syracuse</p>
<p class="speech">I will not stay to-night for all the town;<br>
Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
