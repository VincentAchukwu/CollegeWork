4.1)
The language that the Turing Machine accepts is the following:
L = {a^nb^nc^n | n >= 0}
This means that the number of a's, b's, and c's must all be equal, and greater than 
or equal to zero.

4.2)
Since the string can be of size n (including zero), the complexity of the Turing 
Machine is T(n) where n is the amount of times the reader header has to move. If it 
has to go back to the start of the computation, it becomes 2n, then 3n, and so on.
Therefore the complexity is T(n).
