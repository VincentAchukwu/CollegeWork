<h4>Scene I. Padua. A room in Baptista&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Katharina and
Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong
yourself,<br>
To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;<br>
That I disdain: but for these other gawds,<br>
Unbind my hands, I&#8217;ll pull them off myself,<br>
Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;<br>
Or what you will command me will I do,<br>
So well I know my duty to my elders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell<br>
Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, sister, of all the men alive<br>
I never yet beheld that special face<br>
Which I could fancy more than any other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Minion, thou liest. Is&#8217;t not Hortensio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">If you affect him, sister, here I swear
I&#8217;ll plead for you myself, but you shall have
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">O then, belike, you fancy riches more:<br>
You will have Gremio to keep you fair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Is it for him you do envy me so?<br>
Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive<br>
You have but jested with me all this while:<br>
I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">If that be jest, then all the rest was so.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes her</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Baptista</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, dame! whence grows this
insolence?<br>
Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.<br>
Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.<br>
For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,<br>
Why dost thou wrong her that did ne&#8217;er wrong thee?<br>
When did she cross thee with a bitter word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Her silence flouts me, and I&#8217;ll be
revenged.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flies after Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Bianca</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see<br>
She is your treasure, she must have a husband;<br>
I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day<br>
And for your love to her lead apes in hell.<br>
Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep<br>
Till I can find occasion of revenge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?<br>
But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gremio, Lucentio in the
habit of a mean man; Petruchio, with Hortensio as a musician; and
Tranio, with Biondello bearing a lute and books</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.<br>
God save you, gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a
daughter<br>
Call&#8217;d Katharina, fair and virtuous?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">You are too blunt: go to it orderly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.<br>
I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,<br>
That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,<br>
Her affability and bashful modesty,<br>
Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,<br>
Am bold to show myself a forward guest<br>
Within your house, to make mine eye the witness<br>
Of that report which I so oft have heard.<br>
And, for an entrance to my entertainment,<br>
I do present you with a man of mine,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Presenting
Hortensio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cunning in music and the mathematics,<br>
To instruct her fully in those sciences,<br>
Whereof I know she is not ignorant:<br>
Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:<br>
His name is Licio, born in Mantua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re welcome, sir; and he, for your good
sake.<br>
But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,<br>
She is not for your turn, the more my grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I see you do not mean to part with her,<br>
Or else you like not of my company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.<br>
Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Petruchio is my name; Antonio&#8217;s son,<br>
A man well known throughout all Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I know him well: you are welcome for his
sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,<br>
Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:<br>
Baccare! you are marvellous forward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be
doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
that have been more kindly beholding to you than
any, freely give unto you this young scholar,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Presenting
Lucentio</span></p>
<p class="speech">that hath been long studying at Rheims; as
cunning
in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
accept his service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.<br>
Welcome, good Cambio.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Tranio</span></p>
<p class="speech">But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a
stranger:
may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,<br>
That, being a stranger in this city here,<br>
Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,<br>
Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.<br>
Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,<br>
In the preferment of the eldest sister.<br>
This liberty is all that I request,<br>
That, upon knowledge of my parentage,<br>
I may have welcome &#8217;mongst the rest that woo<br>
And free access and favour as the rest:<br>
And, toward the education of your daughters,<br>
I here bestow a simple instrument,<br>
And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:<br>
If you accept them, then their worth is great.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">A mighty man of Pisa; by report<br>
I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,<br>
Take you the lute, and you the set of books;<br>
You shall go see your pupils presently.<br>
Holla, within!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, lead these gentlemen<br>
To my daughters; and tell them both,<br>
These are their tutors: bid them use them well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant, with Lucentio
and Hortensio, Biondello following</span></p>
<p class="speech">We will go walk a little in the orchard,<br>
And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,<br>
And so I pray you all to think yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,<br>
And every day I cannot come to woo.<br>
You knew my father well, and in him me,<br>
Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,<br>
Which I have better&#8217;d rather than decreased:<br>
Then tell me, if I get your daughter&#8217;s love,<br>
What dowry shall I have with her to wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">After my death the one half of my lands,<br>
And in possession twenty thousand crowns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">And, for that dowry, I&#8217;ll assure her of<br>
Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,<br>
In all my lands and leases whatsoever:<br>
Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,<br>
That covenants may be kept on either hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, when the special thing is well
obtain&#8217;d,<br>
That is, her love; for that is all in all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,<br>
I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;<br>
And where two raging fires meet together<br>
They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:<br>
Though little fire grows great with little wind,<br>
Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:<br>
So I to her and so she yields to me;<br>
For I am rough and woo not like a babe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!<br>
But be thou arm&#8217;d for some unhappy words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,<br>
That shake not, though they blow perpetually.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Hortensio, with his
head broke</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my friend! why dost thou look so
pale?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">What, will my daughter prove a good musician?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">I think she&#8217;ll sooner prove a soldier<br>
Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then thou canst not break her to the
lute?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.<br>
I did but tell her she mistook her frets,<br>
And bow&#8217;d her hand to teach her fingering;<br>
When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,<br>
&#8216;Frets, call you these?&#8217; quoth she; &#8216;I&#8217;ll
fume
with them:&#8217;<br>
And, with that word, she struck me on the head,<br>
And through the instrument my pate made way;<br>
And there I stood amazed for a while,<br>
As on a pillory, looking through the lute;<br>
While she did call me rascal fiddler<br>
And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,<br>
As had she studied to misuse me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;<br>
I love her ten times more than e&#8217;er I did:<br>
O, how I long to have some chat with her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:<br>
Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;<br>
She&#8217;s apt to learn and thankful for good turns.<br>
Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,<br>
Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you do.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Petruchio</span></p>
<p class="speech">I will attend her here,<br>
And woo her with some spirit when she comes.<br>
Say that she rail; why then I&#8217;ll tell her plain<br>
She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:<br>
Say that she frown, I&#8217;ll say she looks as clear<br>
As morning roses newly wash&#8217;d with dew:<br>
Say she be mute and will not speak a word;<br>
Then I&#8217;ll commend her volubility,<br>
And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:<br>
If she do bid me pack, I&#8217;ll give her thanks,<br>
As though she bid me stay by her a week:<br>
If she deny to wed, I&#8217;ll crave the day<br>
When I shall ask the banns and when be married.<br>
But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Katharina</span></p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, Kate; for that&#8217;s your name, I
hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well have you heard, but something hard of
hearing:<br>
They call me Katharina that do talk of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">You lie, in faith; for you are call&#8217;d plain
Kate,<br>
And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;<br>
But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom<br>
Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,<br>
For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,<br>
Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;<br>
Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,<br>
Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,<br>
Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,<br>
Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Moved! in good time: let him that moved you
hither<br>
Remove you hence: I knew you at the first<br>
You were a moveable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what&#8217;s a moveable?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">A join&#8217;d-stool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Asses are made to bear, and so are you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Women are made to bear, and so are you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">No such jade as you, if me you mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;<br>
For, knowing thee to be but young and light&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Too light for such a swain as you to catch;<br>
And yet as heavy as my weight should be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Should be! should&#8212;buzz!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well ta&#8217;en, and like a buzzard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">O slow-wing&#8217;d turtle! shall a buzzard take
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you wasp; i&#8217; faith, you are too
angry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">If I be waspish, best beware my sting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">My remedy is then, to pluck it out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Who knows not where a wasp does
wear his sting? In his tail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">In his tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Whose tongue?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come
again,<br>
Good Kate; I am a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">That I&#8217;ll try.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I swear I&#8217;ll cuff you, if you strike
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">So may you lose your arms:<br>
If you strike me, you are no gentleman;<br>
And if no gentleman, why then no arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">What is your crest? a coxcomb?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so
sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">It is my fashion, when I see a crab.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s no crab; and therefore look not
sour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">There is, there is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Then show it me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Had I a glass, I would.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">What, you mean my face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Well aim&#8217;d of such a young one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yet you are wither&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis with cares.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I care not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.<br>
&#8217;Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,<br>
And now I find report a very liar;<br>
For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,<br>
But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:<br>
Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,<br>
Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,<br>
Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,<br>
But thou with mildness entertain&#8217;st thy wooers,<br>
With gentle conference, soft and affable.<br>
Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?<br>
O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig<br>
Is straight and slender and as brown in hue<br>
As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.<br>
O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Go, fool, and whom thou keep&#8217;st
command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Did ever Dian so become a grove<br>
As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?<br>
O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;<br>
And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you study all this goodly speech?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">It is extempore, from my mother-wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">A witty mother! witless else her son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Am I not wise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Yes; keep you warm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy
bed:<br>
And therefore, setting all this chat aside,<br>
Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented<br>
That you shall be my wife; your dowry &#8217;greed on;<br>
And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.<br>
Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;<br>
For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,<br>
Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,<br>
Thou must be married to no man but me;<br>
For I am he am born to tame you Kate,<br>
And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate<br>
Conformable as other household Kates.<br>
Here comes your father: never make denial;<br>
I must and will have Katharina to my wife.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Baptista, Gremio,
and Tranio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my
daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">How but well, sir? how but well?<br>
It were impossible I should speed amiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your
dumps?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Call you me daughter? now, I promise you<br>
You have show&#8217;d a tender fatherly regard,<br>
To wish me wed to one half lunatic;<br>
A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,<br>
That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Father, &#8217;tis thus: yourself and all the
world,<br>
That talk&#8217;d of her, have talk&#8217;d amiss of her:<br>
If she be curst, it is for policy,<br>
For she&#8217;s not froward, but modest as the dove;<br>
She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;<br>
For patience she will prove a second Grissel,<br>
And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:<br>
And to conclude, we have &#8217;greed so well together,<br>
That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll see thee hang&#8217;d on Sunday
first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, Petruchio; she says she&#8217;ll see
thee
hang&#8217;d first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our
part!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for
myself:<br>
If she and I be pleased, what&#8217;s that to you?<br>
&#8217;Tis bargain&#8217;d &#8217;twixt us twain, being alone,<br>
That she shall still be curst in company.<br>
I tell you, &#8217;tis incredible to believe<br>
How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!<br>
She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss<br>
She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,<br>
That in a twink she won me to her love.<br>
O, you are novices! &#8217;tis a world to see,<br>
How tame, when men and women are alone,<br>
A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.<br>
Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,<br>
To buy apparel &#8217;gainst the wedding-day.<br>
Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;<br>
I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what to say: but give me your
hands;<br>
God send you joy, Petruchio! &#8217;tis a match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;<br>
I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:<br>
We will have rings and things and fine array;<br>
And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o&#8217;sunday.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Petruchio and
Katharina severally</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Was ever match clapp&#8217;d up so suddenly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant&#8217;s
part,<br>
And venture madly on a desperate mart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:<br>
&#8217;Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.<br>
But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:<br>
Now is the day we long have looked for:<br>
I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And I am one that love Bianca more<br>
Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">But thine doth fry.<br>
Skipper, stand back: &#8217;tis age that nourisheth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">But youth in ladies&#8217; eyes that
flourisheth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this
strife:<br>
&#8217;Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both<br>
That can assure my daughter greatest dower<br>
Shall have my Bianca&#8217;s love.<br>
Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">First, as you know, my house within the city<br>
Is richly furnished with plate and gold;<br>
Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;<br>
My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;<br>
In ivory coffers I have stuff&#8217;d my crowns;<br>
In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,<br>
Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,<br>
Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss&#8217;d with pearl,<br>
Valance of Venice gold in needlework,<br>
Pewter and brass and all things that belong<br>
To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm<br>
I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,<br>
Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,<br>
And all things answerable to this portion.<br>
Myself am struck in years, I must confess;<br>
And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,<br>
If whilst I live she will be only mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">That &#8216;only&#8217; came well in. Sir, list
to me:<br>
I am my father&#8217;s heir and only son:<br>
If I may have your daughter to my wife,<br>
I&#8217;ll leave her houses three or four as good,<br>
Within rich Pisa walls, as any one<br>
Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;<br>
Besides two thousand ducats by the year<br>
Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.<br>
What, have I pinch&#8217;d you, Signior Gremio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Two thousand ducats by the year of land!<br>
My land amounts not to so much in all:<br>
That she shall have; besides an argosy<br>
That now is lying in Marseilles&#8217; road.<br>
What, have I choked you with an argosy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Gremio, &#8217;tis known my father hath no
less<br>
Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,<br>
And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,<br>
And twice as much, whate&#8217;er thou offer&#8217;st next.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I have offer&#8217;d all, I have no
more;<br>
And she can have no more than all I have:<br>
If you like me, she shall have me and mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then the maid is mine from all the
world,<br>
By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">I must confess your offer is the best;<br>
And, let your father make her the assurance,<br>
She is your own; else, you must pardon me,<br>
If you should die before him, where&#8217;s her dower?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s but a cavil: he is old, I young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">And may not young men die, as well as old?</p>
<p class="speaker">Baptista</p>
<p class="speech">Well, gentlemen,<br>
I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know<br>
My daughter Katharina is to be married:<br>
Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca<br>
Be bride to you, if you this assurance;<br>
If not, Signior Gremio:<br>
And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gremio</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, good neighbour.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Baptista</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now I fear thee not:<br>
Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool<br>
To give thee all, and in his waning age<br>
Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!<br>
An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">A vengeance on your crafty wither&#8217;d
hide!<br>
Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.<br>
&#8217;Tis in my head to do my master good:<br>
I see no reason but supposed Lucentio<br>
Must get a father, call&#8217;d &#8216;supposed
Vincentio;&#8217;<br>
And that&#8217;s a wonder: fathers commonly<br>
Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,<br>
A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
