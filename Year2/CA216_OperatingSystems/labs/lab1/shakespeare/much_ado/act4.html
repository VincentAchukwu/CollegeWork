<h4>Scene I. A church.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Don Pedro, Don John,
Leonato, Friar Francis, Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the
plain
form of marriage, and you shall recount their
particular duties afterwards.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">To be married to her: friar, you come to marry
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, you come hither to be married to this
count.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">If either of you know any inward impediment why
you
should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
to utter it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Know you any, Hero?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">None, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Know you any, count?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I dare make his answer, none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men
daily
do, not knowing what they do!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
laughing, as, ah, ha, he!</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:<br>
Will you with free and unconstrained soul<br>
Give me this maid, your daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">As freely, son, as God did give her me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">And what have I to give you back, whose worth<br>
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, unless you render her again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet prince, you learn me noble
thankfulness.<br>
There, Leonato, take her back again:<br>
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<br>
She&#8217;s but the sign and semblance of her honour.<br>
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<br>
O, what authority and show of truth<br>
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<br>
Comes not that blood as modest evidence<br>
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<br>
All you that see her, that she were a maid,<br>
By these exterior shows? But she is none:<br>
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<br>
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">What do you mean, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Not to be married,<br>
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<br>
Have vanquish&#8217;d the resistance of her youth,<br>
And made defeat of her virginity,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">I know what you would say: if I have known
her,<br>
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<br>
And so extenuate the &#8217;forehand sin:<br>
No, Leonato,<br>
I never tempted her with word too large;<br>
But, as a brother to his sister, show&#8217;d<br>
Bashful sincerity and comely love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">And seem&#8217;d I ever otherwise to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against
it:<br>
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<br>
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<br>
But you are more intemperate in your blood<br>
Than Venus, or those pamper&#8217;d animals<br>
That rage in savage sensuality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet prince, why speak not you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">What should I speak?<br>
I stand dishonour&#8217;d, that have gone about<br>
To link my dear friend to a common stale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, they are spoken, and these things are
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">This looks not like a nuptial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">True! O God!</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Leonato, stand I here?<br>
Is this the prince? is this the prince&#8217;s brother?<br>
Is this face Hero&#8217;s? are our eyes our own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">All this is so: but what of this, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Let me but move one question to your
daughter;<br>
And, by that fatherly and kindly power<br>
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">O, God defend me! how am I beset!<br>
What kind of catechising call you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">To make you answer truly to your name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<br>
With any just reproach?</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that can Hero;<br>
Hero itself can blot out Hero&#8217;s virtue.<br>
What man was he talk&#8217;d with you yesternight<br>
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<br>
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">I talk&#8217;d with no man at that hour, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don Pedro</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<br>
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<br>
Myself, my brother and this grieved count<br>
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<br>
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window<br>
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<br>
Confess&#8217;d the vile encounters they have had<br>
A thousand times in secret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<br>
Not to be spoke of;<br>
There is not chastity enough in language<br>
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<br>
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Claudio</p>
<p class="speech">O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<br>
If half thy outward graces had been placed<br>
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<br>
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<br>
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<br>
For thee I&#8217;ll lock up all the gates of love,<br>
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>
And never shall it more be gracious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Hath no man&#8217;s dagger here a point for
me?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hero swoons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you
down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Don John</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let us go. These things, come thus to
light,<br>
Smother her spirits up.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Don Pedro, Don John,
and Claudio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">How doth the lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Dead, I think. Help, uncle!<br>
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.<br>
Death is the fairest cover for her shame<br>
That may be wish&#8217;d for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">How now, cousin Hero!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Have comfort, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou look up?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, wherefore should she not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing<br>
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<br>
The story that is printed in her blood?<br>
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:<br>
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<br>
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<br>
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,<br>
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?<br>
Chid I for that at frugal nature&#8217;s frame?<br>
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<br>
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<br>
Why had I not with charitable hand<br>
Took up a beggar&#8217;s issue at my gates,<br>
Who smirch&#8217;d thus and mired with infamy,<br>
I might have said &#8216;No part of it is mine;<br>
This shame derives itself from unknown loins&#8217;?<br>
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised<br>
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<br>
That I myself was to myself not mine,<br>
Valuing of her,&#8212;why, she, O, she is fallen<br>
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br>
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again<br>
And salt too little which may season give<br>
To her foul-tainted flesh!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, sir, be patient.<br>
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,<br>
I know not what to say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly not; although, until last night,<br>
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Confirm&#8217;d, confirm&#8217;d! O, that is
stronger made<br>
Which was before barr&#8217;d up with ribs of iron!<br>
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,<br>
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,<br>
Wash&#8217;d it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me a little;<br>
For I have only been silent so long<br>
And given way unto this course of fortune.<br>
...<br>
By noting of the lady I have mark&#8217;d<br>
A thousand blushing apparitions<br>
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames<br>
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;<br>
And in her eye there hath appear&#8217;d a fire,<br>
To burn the errors that these princes hold<br>
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<br>
Trust not my reading nor my observations,<br>
Which with experimental seal doth warrant<br>
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<br>
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<br>
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here<br>
Under some biting error.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Friar, it cannot be.<br>
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<br>
Is that she will not add to her damnation<br>
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:<br>
Why seek&#8217;st thou then to cover with excuse<br>
That which appears in proper nakedness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, what man is he you are accused of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hero</p>
<p class="speech">They know that do accuse me; I know none:<br>
If I know more of any man alive<br>
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,<br>
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,<br>
Prove you that any man with me conversed<br>
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight<br>
Maintain&#8217;d the change of words with any creature,<br>
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">There is some strange misprision in the
princes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Two of them have the very bent of honour;<br>
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<br>
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,<br>
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<br>
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<br>
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<br>
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<br>
Nor age so eat up my invention,<br>
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<br>
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<br>
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<br>
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<br>
Ability in means and choice of friends,<br>
To quit me of them throughly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Pause awhile,<br>
And let my counsel sway you in this case.<br>
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:<br>
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<br>
And publish it that she is dead indeed;<br>
Maintain a mourning ostentation<br>
And on your family&#8217;s old monument<br>
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<br>
That appertain unto a burial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">What shall become of this? what will this do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<br>
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:<br>
But not for that dream I on this strange course,<br>
But on this travail look for greater birth.<br>
She dying, as it must so be maintain&#8217;d,<br>
Upon the instant that she was accused,<br>
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused<br>
Of every hearer: for it so falls out<br>
That what we have we prize not to the worth<br>
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack&#8217;d and lost,<br>
Why, then we rack the value, then we find<br>
The virtue that possession would not show us<br>
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<br>
When he shall hear she died upon his words,<br>
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<br>
Into his study of imagination,<br>
And every lovely organ of her life<br>
Shall come apparell&#8217;d in more precious habit,<br>
More moving-delicate and full of life,<br>
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<br>
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<br>
If ever love had interest in his liver,<br>
And wish he had not so accused her,<br>
No, though he thought his accusation true.<br>
Let this be so, and doubt not but success<br>
Will fashion the event in better shape<br>
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<br>
But if all aim but this be levell&#8217;d false,<br>
The supposition of the lady&#8217;s death<br>
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<br>
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<br>
As best befits her wounded reputation,<br>
In some reclusive and religious life,<br>
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:<br>
And though you know my inwardness and love<br>
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,<br>
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this<br>
As secretly and justly as your soul<br>
Should with your body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Leonato</p>
<p class="speech">Being that I flow in grief,<br>
The smallest twine may lead me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Francis</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well consented: presently away;<br>
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.<br>
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day<br>
Perhaps is but prolong&#8217;d: have patience and endure.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Benedick and
Beatrice</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and I will weep a while longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I will not desire that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You have no reason; I do it freely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Surely I do believe your fair cousin is
wronged.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that
would right her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is there any way to show such friendship?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">A very even way, but no such friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">May a man do it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">It is a man&#8217;s office, but not yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I do love nothing in the world so well as you:
is
not that strange?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">As strange as the thing I know not. It were
as
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Do not swear, and eat it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">I will swear by it that you love me; and I will
make
him eat it that says I love not you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not eat your word?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">With no sauce that can be devised to it. I
protest<br>
I love thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, God forgive me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">What offence, sweet Beatrice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about
to
protest I loved you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">And do it with all thy heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I love you with so much of my heart that none
is
left to protest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Come, bid me do any thing for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Kill Claudio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! not for the wide world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You kill me to deny it. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, sweet Beatrice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">I am gone, though I am here: there is no love
in
you: nay, I pray you, let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Beatrice,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">In faith, I will go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll be friends first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">You dare easier be friends with me than fight
with mine enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Is Claudio thine enemy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Is he not approved in the height a villain,
that
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
come to take hands; and then, with public
accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
&#8212;O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
in the market-place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, Beatrice,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Talk with a man out at a window! A proper
saying!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but, Beatrice,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she
is undone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Beat&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Princes and counties! Surely, a princely
testimony,
a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Use it for my love some other way than swearing
by it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath
wronged Hero?</p>
<p class="speaker">Beatrice</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benedick</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I
will
kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is
Conrade.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters,
do
you serve God?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, sir, we hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Write down, that they hope they serve God:
and
write God first; for God defend but God should go
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
that you are little better than false knaves; and it
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
you for yourselves?</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, we say we are none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but
I
will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
you are false knaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I say to you we are none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Well, stand aside. &#8217;Fore God, they are both
in a
tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sexton</p>
<p class="speech">Master constable, you go not the way to
examine:
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, marry, that&#8217;s the eftest way. Let the
watch
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince&#8217;s
name, accuse these men.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">This man said, sir, that Don John, the
prince&#8217;s
brother, was a villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is
flat
perjury, to call a prince&#8217;s brother villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Borachio</p>
<p class="speech">Master constable,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy
look,<br>
I promise thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sexton</p>
<p class="speech">What heard you him say else?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats
of<br>
Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Flat burglary as ever was committed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, by mass, that it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sexton</p>
<p class="speech">What else, fellow?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words,
to
disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">O villain! thou wilt be condemned into
everlasting
redemption for this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sexton</p>
<p class="speech">What else?</p>
<p class="speaker">Watchman</p>
<p class="speech">This is all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sexton</p>
<p class="speech">And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
Master constable, let these men be bound, and
brought to Leonato&#8217;s: I will go before and show
him their examination.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let them be opinioned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Verges</p>
<p class="speech">Let them be in the hands&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Off, coxcomb!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s my life, where&#8217;s the sexton?
let him write
down the prince&#8217;s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
Thou naughty varlet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Conrade</p>
<p class="speech">Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dogberry</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
I had been writ down an ass!</p>
