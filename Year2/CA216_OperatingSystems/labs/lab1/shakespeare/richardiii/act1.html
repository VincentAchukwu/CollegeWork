<h4>Scene I. London. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester,
solus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now is the winter of our discontent<br>
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<br>
And all the clouds that lour&#8217;d upon our house<br>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<br>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;<br>
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;<br>
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,<br>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br>
Grim-visaged war hath smooth&#8217;d his wrinkled front;<br>
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds<br>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br>
He capers nimbly in a lady&#8217;s chamber<br>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<br>
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,<br>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<br>
I, that am rudely stamp&#8217;d, and want love&#8217;s majesty<br>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<br>
I, that am curtail&#8217;d of this fair proportion,<br>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<br>
Deformed, unfinish&#8217;d, sent before my time<br>
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,<br>
And that so lamely and unfashionable<br>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;<br>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<br>
Have no delight to pass away the time,<br>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun<br>
And descant on mine own deformity:<br>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,<br>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br>
I am determined to prove a villain<br>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<br>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br>
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,<br>
To set my brother Clarence and the king<br>
In deadly hate the one against the other:<br>
And if King Edward be as true and just<br>
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,<br>
This day should Clarence closely be mew&#8217;d up,<br>
About a prophecy, which says that &#8216;G&#8217;<br>
Of Edward&#8217;s heirs the murderer shall be.<br>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here<br>
Clarence comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clarence, guarded, and
Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speech">Brother, good day; what means this armed
guard<br>
That waits upon your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">His majesty<br>
Tendering my person&#8217;s safety, hath appointed<br>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Upon what cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Because my name is George.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;<br>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:<br>
O, belike his majesty hath some intent<br>
That you shall be new-christen&#8217;d in the Tower.<br>
But what&#8217;s the matter, Clarence? may I know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest<br>
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,<br>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;<br>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.<br>
And says a wizard told him that by G<br>
His issue disinherited should be;<br>
And, for my name of George begins with G,<br>
It follows in his thought that I am he.<br>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these<br>
Have moved his highness to commit me now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:<br>
&#8217;Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:<br>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, &#8217;tis she<br>
That tempers him to this extremity.<br>
Was it not she and that good man of worship,<br>
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,<br>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,<br>
From whence this present day he is deliver&#8217;d?<br>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I think there&#8217;s no man is
secure<br>
But the queen&#8217;s kindred and night-walking heralds<br>
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.<br>
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant<br>
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Humbly complaining to her deity<br>
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you what; I think it is our way,<br>
If we will keep in favour with the king,<br>
To be her men and wear her livery:<br>
The jealous o&#8217;erworn widow and herself,<br>
Since that our brother dubb&#8217;d them gentlewomen.<br>
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your graces both to pardon me;<br>
His majesty hath straitly given in charge<br>
That no man shall have private conference,<br>
Of what degree soever, with his brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Even so; an&#8217;t please your worship,
Brakenbury,<br>
You may partake of any thing we say:<br>
We speak no treason, man: we say the king<br>
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen<br>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;<br>
We say that Shore&#8217;s wife hath a pretty foot,<br>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;<br>
And that the queen&#8217;s kindred are made gentle-folks:<br>
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee,
fellow,<br>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,<br>
Were best he do it secretly, alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">What one, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal<br>
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">We are the queen&#8217;s abjects, and must
obey.<br>
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;<br>
And whatsoever you will employ me in,<br>
Were it to call King Edward&#8217;s widow sister,<br>
I will perform it to enfranchise you.<br>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood<br>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;<br>
Meantime, have patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I must perforce. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury,
and Guard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne&#8217;er
return.<br>
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,<br>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,<br>
If heaven will take the present at our hands.<br>
But who comes here? the new-deliver&#8217;d Hastings?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">As much unto my good lord chamberlain!<br>
Well are you welcome to the open air.<br>
How hath your lordship brook&#8217;d imprisonment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:<br>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks<br>
That were the cause of my imprisonment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence
too;<br>
For they that were your enemies are his,<br>
And have prevail&#8217;d as much on him as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">More pity that the eagle should be
mew&#8217;d,<br>
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What news abroad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">No news so bad abroad as this at home;<br>
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,<br>
And his physicians fear him mightily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.<br>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,<br>
And overmuch consumed his royal person:<br>
&#8217;Tis very grievous to be thought upon.<br>
What, is he in his bed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">He is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Go you before, and I will follow you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speech">He cannot live, I hope; and must not die<br>
Till George be pack&#8217;d with post-horse up to heaven.<br>
I&#8217;ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,<br>
With lies well steel&#8217;d with weighty arguments;<br>
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,<br>
Clarence hath not another day to live:<br>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,<br>
And leave the world for me to bustle in!<br>
For then I&#8217;ll marry Warwick&#8217;s youngest daughter.<br>
What though I kill&#8217;d her husband and her father?<br>
The readiest way to make the wench amends<br>
Is to become her husband and her father:<br>
The which will I; not all so much for love<br>
As for another secret close intent,<br>
By marrying her which I must reach unto.<br>
But yet I run before my horse to market:<br>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:<br>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. Another street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the corpse of King
Henry the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; Lady Anne
being the mourner</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Set down, set down your honourable load,<br>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,<br>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament<br>
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.<br>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!<br>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!<br>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!<br>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,<br>
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,<br>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter&#8217;d son,<br>
Stabb&#8217;d by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!<br>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,<br>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.<br>
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!<br>
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!<br>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!<br>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,<br>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,<br>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<br>
Or any creeping venom&#8217;d thing that lives!<br>
If ever he have child, abortive be it,<br>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<br>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<br>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;<br>
And that be heir to his unhappiness!<br>
If ever he have wife, let her he made<br>
A miserable by the death of him<br>
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!<br>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<br>
Taken from Paul&#8217;s to be interred there;<br>
And still, as you are weary of the weight,<br>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry&#8217;s corse.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it
down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What black magician conjures up this fiend,<br>
To stop devoted charitable deeds?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint
Paul,<br>
I&#8217;ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Unmanner&#8217;d dog! stand thou, when I
command:<br>
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,<br>
Or, by Saint Paul, I&#8217;ll strike thee to my foot,<br>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?<br>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,<br>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.<br>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!<br>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,<br>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Foul devil, for God&#8217;s sake, hence, and
trouble us not;<br>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,<br>
Fill&#8217;d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.<br>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,<br>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.<br>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry&#8217;s wounds<br>
Open their congeal&#8217;d mouths and bleed afresh!<br>
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;<br>
For &#8217;tis thy presence that exhales this blood<br>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;<br>
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,<br>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.<br>
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!<br>
O earth, which this blood drink&#8217;st revenge his death!<br>
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead,<br>
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,<br>
As thou dost swallow up this good king&#8217;s blood<br>
Which his hell-govern&#8217;d arm hath butchered!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, you know no rules of charity,<br>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou know&#8217;st no law of God nor
man:<br>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.<br>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<br>
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,<br>
For these known evils, but to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have<br>
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst
make<br>
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">By such despair, I should accuse myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand
excused;<br>
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,<br>
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Say that I slew them not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then they are not dead:<br>
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I did not kill your husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then he is alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret
saw<br>
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;<br>
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,<br>
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.<br>
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:<br>
Didst thou not kill this king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I grant ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me
too<br>
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!<br>
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let him thank me, that holp to send him
thither;<br>
For he was fitter for that place than earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And thou unfit for any place but hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Some dungeon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Your bed-chamber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll rest betide the chamber where thou
liest!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">So will it, madam till I lie with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I hope so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,<br>
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,<br>
And fall somewhat into a slower method,<br>
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths<br>
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,<br>
As blameful as the executioner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your beauty was the cause of that effect;<br>
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep<br>
To undertake the death of all the world,<br>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,<br>
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">These eyes could never endure sweet
beauty&#8217;s wreck;<br>
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:<br>
As all the world is cheered by the sun,<br>
So I by that; it is my day, my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Black night o&#8217;ershade thy day, and death
thy life!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art
both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It is a quarrel most unnatural,<br>
To be revenged on him that loveth you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">It is a quarrel just and reasonable,<br>
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,<br>
Did it to help thee to a better husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He lives that loves thee better than he
could.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Name him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Plantagenet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that was he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She spitteth at
him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou spit at me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Never came poison from so sweet a place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Never hung poison on a fouler toad.<br>
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Would they were basilisks, to strike thee
dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I would they were, that I might die at once;<br>
For now they kill me with a living death.<br>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,<br>
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:<br>
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,<br>
No, when my father York and Edward wept,<br>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made<br>
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;<br>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,<br>
Told the sad story of my father&#8217;s death,<br>
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,<br>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks<br>
Like trees bedash&#8217;d with rain: in that sad time<br>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;<br>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,<br>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.<br>
I never sued to friend nor enemy;<br>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;<br>
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,<br>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She looks scornfully at
him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were
made<br>
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.<br>
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,<br>
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;<br>
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.<br>
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,<br>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,<br>
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He lays his breast open: she
offers at it with his sword</span></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,<br>
But &#8217;twas thy beauty that provoked me.<br>
Nay, now dispatch; &#8217;twas I that stabb&#8217;d young
Edward,<br>
But &#8217;twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here she lets fall the
sword</span></p>
<p class="speech">Take up the sword again, or take up me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,<br>
I will not be the executioner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I have already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Tush, that was in thy rage:<br>
Speak it again, and, even with the word,<br>
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,<br>
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;<br>
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I would I knew thy heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis figured in my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I fear me both are false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Then never man was true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, put up your sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Say, then, my peace is made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">That shall you know hereafter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But shall I live in hope?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">All men, I hope, live so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">To take is not to give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.<br>
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;<br>
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.<br>
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may<br>
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,<br>
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">That it would please thee leave these sad
designs<br>
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,<br>
And presently repair to Crosby Place;<br>
Where, after I have solemnly interr&#8217;d<br>
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,<br>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,<br>
I will with all expedient duty see you:<br>
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,<br>
Grant me this boon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart; and much it joys me too,<br>
To see you are become so penitent.<br>
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Bid me farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis more than you deserve;<br>
But since you teach me how to flatter you,<br>
Imagine I have said farewell already.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lady Anne, Tressel,

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, take up the corse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentlemen</p>
<p class="speech">Towards Chertsey, noble lord?</p>

Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speech">Was ever woman in this humour woo&#8217;d?<br>
Was ever woman in this humour won?<br>
I&#8217;ll have her; but I will not keep her long.<br>
What! I, that kill&#8217;d her husband and his father,<br>
To take her in her heart&#8217;s extremest hate,<br>
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,<br>
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;<br>
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,<br>
And I nothing to back my suit at all,<br>
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,<br>
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!<br>
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,<br>
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,<br>
Stabb&#8217;d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?<br>
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,<br>
Framed in the prodigality of nature,<br>
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,<br>
The spacious world cannot again afford<br>
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,<br>
That cropp&#8217;d the golden prime of this sweet prince,<br>
And made her widow to a woful bed?<br>
On me, whose all not equals Edward&#8217;s moiety?<br>
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?<br>
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,<br>
I do mistake my person all this while:<br>
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,<br>
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.<br>
I&#8217;ll be at charges for a looking-glass,<br>
And entertain some score or two of tailors,<br>
To study fashions to adorn my body:<br>
Since I am crept in favour with myself,<br>
Will maintain it with some little cost.<br>
But first I&#8217;ll turn yon fellow in his grave;<br>
And then return lamenting to my love.<br>
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,<br>
That I may see my shadow as I pass.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Elizabeth,
Rivers, and Grey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, madam: there&#8217;s no doubt his
majesty<br>
Will soon recover his accustom&#8217;d health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:<br>
Therefore, for God&#8217;s sake, entertain good comfort,<br>
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">If he were dead, what would betide of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">No other harm but loss of such a lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The loss of such a lord includes all harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">The heavens have bless&#8217;d you with a goodly
son,<br>
To be your comforter when he is gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, he is young and his minority<br>
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,<br>
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">It is determined, not concluded yet:<br>
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Buckingham and
Derby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Good time of day unto your royal grace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">God make your majesty joyful as you have
been!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.<br>
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.<br>
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she&#8217;s your wife,<br>
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured<br>
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you, either not believe<br>
The envious slanders of her false accusers;<br>
Or, if she be accused in true report,<br>
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds<br>
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">But now the Duke of Buckingham and I<br>
Are come from visiting his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, good hope; his grace speaks
cheerfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">God grant him health! Did you confer with
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement<br>
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,<br>
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;<br>
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Would all were well! but that will never be<br>
I fear our happiness is at the highest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester, Hastings,
and Dorset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:<br>
Who are they that complain unto the king,<br>
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?<br>
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly<br>
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.<br>
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,<br>
Smile in men&#8217;s faces, smooth, deceive and cog,<br>
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,<br>
I must be held a rancorous enemy.<br>
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,<br>
But thus his simple truth must be abused<br>
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">To whom in all this presence speaks your
grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.<br>
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?<br>
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?<br>
A plague upon you all! His royal person,&#8212;<br>
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&#8212;<br>
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,<br>
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
matter.<br>
The king, of his own royal disposition,<br>
And not provoked by any suitor else;<br>
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,<br>
Which in your outward actions shows itself<br>
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,<br>
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather<br>
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,<br>
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:<br>
Since every Jack became a gentleman<br>
There&#8217;s many a gentle person made a Jack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, we know your meaning, brother<br>
Gloucester;<br>
You envy my advancement and my friends&#8217;:<br>
God grant we never may have need of you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Meantime, God grants that we have need of
you:<br>
Your brother is imprison&#8217;d by your means,<br>
Myself disgraced, and the nobility<br>
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions<br>
Are daily given to ennoble those<br>
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">By Him that raised me to this careful height<br>
From that contented hap which I enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
I never did incense his majesty<br>
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been<br>
An earnest advocate to plead for him.<br>
My lord, you do me shameful injury,<br>
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">You may deny that you were not the cause<br>
Of my Lord Hastings&#8217; late imprisonment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">She may, my lord, for&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?<br>
She may do more, sir, than denying that:<br>
She may help you to many fair preferments,<br>
And then deny her aiding hand therein,<br>
And lay those honours on your high deserts.<br>
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">What, marry, may she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What, marry, may she! marry with a king,<br>
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:<br>
I wis your grandam had a worser match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne<br>
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:<br>
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty<br>
With those gross taunts I often have endured.<br>
I had rather be a country servant-maid<br>
Than a great queen, with this condition,<br>
To be thus taunted, scorn&#8217;d, and baited at:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret,
behind</span></p>
<p class="speech">Small joy have I in being England&#8217;s
queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And lessen&#8217;d be that small, God, I beseech
thee!<br>
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What! threat you me with telling of the king?<br>
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said<br>
I will avouch in presence of the king:<br>
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.<br>
&#8217;Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Out, devil! I remember them too well:<br>
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,<br>
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband
king,<br>
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;<br>
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,<br>
A liberal rewarder of his friends:<br>
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">In all which time you and your husband Grey<br>
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;<br>
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband<br>
In Margaret&#8217;s battle at Saint Alban&#8217;s slain?<br>
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,<br>
What you have been ere now, and what you are;<br>
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A murderous villain, and so still thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Poor Clarence did forsake his father,
Warwick;<br>
Yea, and forswore himself,&#8212;which Jesu pardon!&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Which God revenge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To fight on Edward&#8217;s party for the
crown;<br>
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew&#8217;d up.<br>
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward&#8217;s;<br>
Or Edward&#8217;s soft and pitiful, like mine<br>
I am too childish-foolish for this world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the
world,<br>
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days<br>
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,<br>
We follow&#8217;d then our lord, our lawful king:<br>
So should we you, if you should be our king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:<br>
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">As little joy, my lord, as you suppose<br>
You should enjoy, were you this country&#8217;s king,<br>
As little joy may you suppose in me.<br>
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;<br>
For I am she, and altogether joyless.<br>
I can no longer hold me patient.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Advancing</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out<br>
In sharing that which you have pill&#8217;d from me!<br>
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?<br>
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,<br>
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?<br>
O gentle villain, do not turn away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my
sight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">But repetition of what thou hast
marr&#8217;d;<br>
That will I make before I let thee go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I was; but I do find more pain in banishment<br>
Than death can yield me here by my abode.<br>
A husband and a son thou owest to me;<br>
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:<br>
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,<br>
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The curse my noble father laid on thee,<br>
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper<br>
And with thy scorns drew&#8217;st rivers from his eyes,<br>
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout<br>
Steep&#8217;d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&#8212;<br>
His curses, then from bitterness of soul<br>
Denounced against thee, are all fall&#8217;n upon thee;<br>
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">So just is God, to right the innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;twas the foulest deed to slay that
babe,<br>
And the most merciless that e&#8217;er was heard of!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">No man but prophesied revenge for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What were you snarling all before I came,<br>
Ready to catch each other by the throat,<br>
And turn you all your hatred now on me?<br>
Did York&#8217;s dread curse prevail so much with heaven?<br>
That Henry&#8217;s death, my lovely Edward&#8217;s death,<br>
Their kingdom&#8217;s loss, my woful banishment,<br>
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?<br>
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?<br>
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!<br>
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,<br>
As ours by murder, to make him a king!<br>
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,<br>
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,<br>
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!<br>
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,<br>
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!<br>
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children&#8217;s loss;<br>
And see another, as I see thee now,<br>
Deck&#8217;d in thy rights, as thou art stall&#8217;d in mine!<br>
Long die thy happy days before thy death;<br>
And, after many lengthen&#8217;d hours of grief,<br>
Die neither mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s queen!<br>
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,<br>
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son<br>
Was stabb&#8217;d with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,<br>
That none of you may live your natural age,<br>
But by some unlook&#8217;d accident cut off!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither&#8217;d
hag!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt
hear me.<br>
If heaven have any grievous plague in store<br>
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,<br>
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,<br>
And then hurl down their indignation<br>
On thee, the troubler of the poor world&#8217;s peace!<br>
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!<br>
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,<br>
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!<br>
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,<br>
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream<br>
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!<br>
Thou elvish-mark&#8217;d, abortive, rooting hog!<br>
Thou that wast seal&#8217;d in thy nativity<br>
The slave of nature and the son of hell!<br>
Thou slander of thy mother&#8217;s heavy womb!<br>
Thou loathed issue of thy father&#8217;s loins!<br>
Thou rag of honour! thou detested&#8212;</p>

<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I call thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought<br>
That thou hadst call&#8217;d me all these bitter names.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I did; but look&#8217;d for no reply.<br>
O, let me make the period to my curse!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis done by me, and ends in

Why strew&#8217;st thou sugar on that bottled spider,<br>
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?<br>
Fool, fool! thou whet&#8217;st a knife to kill thyself.<br>
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me<br>
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback&#8217;d toad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,<br>
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Were you well served, you would be taught your
duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">To serve me well, you all should do me duty,<br>
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:<br>
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:<br>
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.<br>
O, that your young nobility could judge<br>
What &#8217;twere to lose it, and be miserable!<br>
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;<br>
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it,
marquess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,<br>
Our aery buildeth in the cedar&#8217;s top,<br>
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!<br>
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;<br>
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath<br>
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.<br>
Your aery buildeth in our aery&#8217;s nest.<br>
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!<br>
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Have done! for shame, if not for charity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Urge neither charity nor shame to me:<br>
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,<br>
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher&#8217;d.<br>

<p class="speech">O princely Buckingham I&#8217;ll kiss thy
hand,<br>
In sign of league and amity with thee:<br>
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!<br>
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,<br>
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Nor no one here; for curses never pass<br>
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not believe but they ascend the
sky,<br>
And there awake God&#8217;s gentle-sleeping peace.<br>
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!<br>
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,<br>
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:<br>
Have not to do with him, beware of him;<br>
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,<br>
And all their ministers attend on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
counsel?<br>
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?<br>
O, but remember this another day,<br>
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,<br>
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!<br>
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,<br>
And he to yours, and all of you to God&#8217;s!</p>

<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot blame her: by God&#8217;s holy
mother,<br>
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent<br>
My part thereof that I have done to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">I never did her any, to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But you have all the vantage of her wrong.<br>
I was too hot to do somebody good,<br>
That is too cold in thinking of it now.<br>
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,<br>
He is frank&#8217;d up to fatting for his pains<br>
God pardon them that are the cause of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>

I lay unto the grievous charge of others.<br>
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,<br>
I do beweep to many simple gulls<br>
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;<br>
And say it is the queen and her allies<br>
That stir the king against the duke my brother.<br>
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me<br>
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:<br>
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,<br>
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:<br>
And thus I clothe my naked villany<br>
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;<br>
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.</p>

<p class="speech">Well thought upon; I have it here about me.</p>

<p class="speech">When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.<br>
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,<br>
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;<br>
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps<br>
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Tush!<br>
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;<br>
Talkers are no good doers: be assured<br>
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your eyes drop millstones, when fools&#8217; eyes

I like you, lads; about your business straight;<br>

<h4>Scene IV. London. The Tower.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clarence and
Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Why looks your grace so heavily today?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, I have pass&#8217;d a miserable night,<br>
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,<br>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,<br>
I would not spend another such a night,<br>
Though &#8217;twere to buy a world of happy days,<br>
So full of dismal terror was the time!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">What was your dream? I long to hear you tell
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,<br>
And was embark&#8217;d to cross to Burgundy;<br>
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;<br>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk<br>
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,<br>
And cited up a thousand fearful times,<br>
During the wars of York and Lancaster<br>
That had befall&#8217;n us. As we paced along<br>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,<br>
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,<br>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,<br>
Into the tumbling billows of the main.<br>
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!<br>
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!<br>
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!<br>
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;<br>
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw&#8217;d upon;<br>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,<br>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<br>
All scatter&#8217;d in the bottom of the sea:<br>
Some lay in dead men&#8217;s skulls; and, in those holes<br>
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,<br>
As &#8217;twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,<br>
Which woo&#8217;d the slimy bottom of the deep,<br>
And mock&#8217;d the dead bones that lay scatter&#8217;d by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Had you such leisure in the time of death<br>
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Methought I had; and often did I strive<br>
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood<br>
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth<br>
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;<br>
But smother&#8217;d it within my panting bulk,<br>
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Awaked you not with this sore agony?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, my dream was lengthen&#8217;d after
life;<br>
O, then began the tempest to my soul,<br>
Who pass&#8217;d, methought, the melancholy flood,<br>
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,<br>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.<br>
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,<br>
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;<br>
Who cried aloud, &#8216;What scourge for perjury<br>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?&#8217;<br>
And so he vanish&#8217;d: then came wandering by<br>
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair<br>
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak&#8217;d out aloud,<br>
&#8216;Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,<br>
That stabb&#8217;d me in the field by Tewksbury;<br>
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!&#8217;<br>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends<br>
Environ&#8217;d me about, and howled in mine ears<br>
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise<br>
I trembling waked, and for a season after<br>
Could not believe but that I was in hell,<br>
Such terrible impression made the dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;<br>
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O Brakenbury, I have done those things,<br>
Which now bear evidence against my soul,<br>
For Edward&#8217;s sake; and see how he requites me!<br>
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,<br>
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,<br>
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,<br>
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!<br>
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;<br>
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord: God give your grace good
rest!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clarence sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,<br>
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.<br>
Princes have but their tides for their glories,<br>
An outward honour for an inward toil;<br>
And, for unfelt imagination,<br>
They often feel a world of restless cares:<br>
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,<br>
There&#8217;s nothing differs but the outward fame.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the two
Murderers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Ho! who&#8217;s here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name what are you, and how came
you hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on
my legs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, are you so brief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious.
Show
him our commission; talk no more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Brakenbury reads
it</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I am, in this, commanded to deliver<br>
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:<br>
I will not reason what is meant hereby,<br>
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.<br>
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:<br>
I&#8217;ll to the king; and signify to him<br>
That thus I have resign&#8217;d my charge to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you
well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">No; then he will say &#8217;twas done cowardly,
when he wakes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake
till
the judgment-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then he will say we stabbed him
sleeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">The urging of that word &#8216;judgment&#8217;
hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou afraid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to
be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I thought thou hadst been resolute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">So I am, to let him live.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy
humour
will change; &#8217;twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou feel thyself now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
are yet
within me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Remember our reward, when the deed is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the
reward.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy conscience now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">In the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">So when he opens his purse to give us our
reward,
thy conscience flies out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Let it go; there&#8217;s few or none will
entertain it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How if it come to thee again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous
thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour&#8217;s wife, but it
detects him: &#8217;tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man&#8217;s bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, it is even now at my elbow,
persuading me
not to kill the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not:
he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with
me,<br>
I warrant thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Take him over the costard with the hilts of
thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent devise! make a sop of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">No, first let&#8217;s reason with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of
wine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second murderer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, what art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">A man, as you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">But not, as I am, royal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Nor you, as we are, loyal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are
humble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">My voice is now the king&#8217;s, my looks mine
own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!<br>
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?<br>
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">To, to, to&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">To murder me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,<br>
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.<br>
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Offended us you have not, but the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I shall be reconciled to him again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Are you call&#8217;d forth from out a world of
men<br>
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?<br>
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?<br>
What lawful quest have given their verdict up<br>
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced<br>
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence&#8217; death?<br>
Before I be convict by course of law,<br>
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.<br>
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption<br>
By Christ&#8217;s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,<br>
That you depart and lay no hands on me<br>
The deed you undertake is damnable.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What we will do, we do upon command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And he that hath commanded is the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings<br>
Hath in the tables of his law commanded<br>
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,<br>
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man&#8217;s?<br>
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,<br>
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,<br>
For false forswearing and for murder too:<br>
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,<br>
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And, like a traitor to the name of God,<br>
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade<br>
Unrip&#8217;dst the bowels of thy sovereign&#8217;s son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou urge God&#8217;s dreadful law to
us,<br>
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?<br>
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,<br>
He sends ye not to murder me for this<br>
For in this sin he is as deep as I.<br>
If God will be revenged for this deed.<br>
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,<br>
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;<br>
He needs no indirect nor lawless course<br>
To cut off those that have offended him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,<br>
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,<br>
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">My brother&#8217;s love, the devil, and my
rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Thy brother&#8217;s love, our duty, and thy
fault,<br>
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;<br>
I am his brother, and I love him well.<br>
If you be hired for meed, go back again,<br>
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,<br>
Who shall reward you better for my life<br>
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:<br>
Go you to him from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so we will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him, when that our princely father York<br>
Bless&#8217;d his three sons with his victorious arm,<br>
And charged us from his soul to love each other,<br>
He little thought of this divided friendship:<br>
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, millstones; as be lesson&#8217;d us to
weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Right,<br>
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:<br>
&#8217;Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">It cannot be; for when I parted with him,<br>
He hugg&#8217;d me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,<br>
That he would labour my delivery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee<br>
From this world&#8217;s thraldom to the joys of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Make peace with God, for you must die, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,<br>
To counsel me to make my peace with God,<br>
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,<br>
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?<br>
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on<br>
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What shall we do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Relent, and save your souls.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Relent! &#8217;tis cowardly and womanish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.<br>
Which of you, if you were a prince&#8217;s son,<br>
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,<br>
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,<br>
Would not entreat for life?<br>
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:<br>
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,<br>
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,<br>
As you would beg, were you in my distress<br>
A begging prince what beggar pities not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
