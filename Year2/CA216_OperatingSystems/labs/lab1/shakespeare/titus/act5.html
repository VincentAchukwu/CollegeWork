<h4>Scene I. Plains near Rome.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius with an army of
Goths, with drum and colours</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,<br>
I have received letters from great Rome,<br>
Which signify what hate they bear their emperor<br>
And how desirous of our sight they are.<br>
Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,<br>
Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,<br>
And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,<br>
Let him make treble satisfaction.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Goth</p>
<p class="speech">Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,<br>
Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;<br>
Whose high exploits and honourable deeds<br>
Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,<br>
Be bold in us: we&#8217;ll follow where thou lead&#8217;st,<br>
Like stinging bees in hottest summer&#8217;s day<br>
Led by their master to the flowered fields,<br>
And be avenged on cursed Tamora.</p>
<p class="speaker">All the Goths</p>
<p class="speech">And as he saith, so say we all with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.<br>
But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Goth, leading Aaron
with his Child in his arms</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Goth</p>
<p class="speech">Renowned Lucius, from our troops I
stray&#8217;d<br>
To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;<br>
And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye<br>
Upon the wasted building, suddenly<br>
I heard a child cry underneath a wall.<br>
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard<br>
The crying babe controll&#8217;d with this discourse:<br>
&#8216;Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!<br>
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,<br>
Had nature lent thee but thy mother&#8217;s look,<br>
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:<br>
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,<br>
They never do beget a coal-black calf.<br>
Peace, villain, peace!&#8217;&#8212;even thus he rates
the babe,&#8212;<br>
&#8216;For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;<br>
Who, when he knows thou art the empress&#8217; babe,<br>
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother&#8217;s sake.&#8217;<br>
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush&#8217;d upon him,<br>
Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,<br>
To use as you think needful of the man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil<br>
That robb&#8217;d Andronicus of his good hand;<br>
This is the pearl that pleased your empress&#8217; eye,<br>
And here&#8217;s the base fruit of his burning lust.<br>
Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey<br>
This growing image of thy fiend-like face?<br>
Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?<br>
A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.<br>
And by his side his fruit of bastardy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Too like the sire for ever being good.<br>
First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;<br>
A sight to vex the father&#8217;s soul withal.<br>
Get me a ladder.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A ladder brought, which Aaron
is made to ascend</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Lucius, save the child,<br>
And bear it from me to the empress.<br>
If thou do this, I&#8217;ll show thee wondrous things,<br>
That highly may advantage thee to hear:<br>
If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,<br>
I&#8217;ll speak no more but &#8216;Vengeance rot you
all!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Say on: an if it please me which thou
speak&#8217;st<br>
Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">An if it please thee! why, assure thee,
Lucius,<br>
&#8217;Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;<br>
For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,<br>
Acts of black night, abominable deeds,<br>
Complots of mischief, treason, villanies<br>
Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform&#8217;d:<br>
And this shall all be buried by my death,<br>
Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:<br>
That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;<br>
Yet, for I know thou art religious<br>
And hast a thing within thee called conscience,<br>
With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,<br>
Which I have seen thee careful to observe,<br>
Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know<br>
An idiot holds his bauble for a god<br>
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,<br>
To that I&#8217;ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow<br>
By that same god, what god soe&#8217;er it be,<br>
That thou adorest and hast in reverence,<br>
To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;<br>
Or else I will discover nought to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Even by my god I swear to thee I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">First know thou, I begot him on the empress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O most insatiate and luxurious woman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity<br>
To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.<br>
&#8217;Twas her two sons that murder&#8217;d Bassianus;<br>
They cut thy sister&#8217;s tongue and ravish&#8217;d her<br>
And cut her hands and trimm&#8217;d her as thou saw&#8217;st.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O detestable villain! call&#8217;st thou that
trimming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she was wash&#8217;d and cut and
trimm&#8217;d, and &#8217;twas<br>
Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:<br>
That codding spirit had they from their mother,<br>
As sure a card as ever won the set;<br>
That bloody mind, I think, they learn&#8217;d of me,<br>
As true a dog as ever fought at head.<br>
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.<br>
I train&#8217;d thy brethren to that guileful hole<br>
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:<br>
I wrote the letter that thy father found<br>
And hid the gold within the letter mention&#8217;d,<br>
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:<br>
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,<br>
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?<br>
I play&#8217;d the cheater for thy father&#8217;s hand,<br>
And, when I had it, drew myself apart<br>
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:<br>
I pry&#8217;d me through the crevice of a wall<br>
When, for his hand, he had his two sons&#8217; heads;<br>
Beheld his tears, and laugh&#8217;d so heartily,<br>
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :<br>
And when I told the empress of this sport,<br>
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,<br>
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Goth</p>
<p class="speech">What, canst thou say all this, and never
blush?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.<br>
Even now I curse the day&#8212;and yet, I think,<br>
Few come within the compass of my curse,&#8212;<br>
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,<br>
As kill a man, or else devise his death,<br>
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,<br>
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,<br>
Set deadly enmity between two friends,<br>
Make poor men&#8217;s cattle break their necks;<br>
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,<br>
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.<br>
Oft have I digg&#8217;d up dead men from their graves,<br>
And set them upright at their dear friends&#8217; doors,<br>
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;<br>
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,<br>
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,<br>
&#8216;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.&#8217;<br>
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things<br>
As willingly as one would kill a fly,<br>
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<br>
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Bring down the devil; for he must not die<br>
So sweet a death as hanging presently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">If there be devils, would I were a devil,<br>
To live and burn in everlasting fire,<br>
So I might have your company in hell,<br>
But to torment you with my bitter tongue!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no
more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Goth</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Third Goth</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, there is a messenger from Rome<br>
Desires to be admitted to your presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Let him come near.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aemilius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Aemilius what&#8217;s the news from
Rome?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemilius</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,<br>
The Roman emperor greets you all by me;<br>
And, for he understands you are in arms,<br>
He craves a parley at your father&#8217;s house,<br>
Willing you to demand your hostages,<br>
And they shall be immediately deliver&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Goth</p>
<p class="speech">What says our general?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Aemilius, let the emperor give his pledges<br>
Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,<br>
And we will come. March away.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Rome. Before Titus&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tamora, Demetrius, and
Chiron, disguised</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,<br>
I will encounter with Andronicus,<br>
And say I am Revenge, sent from below<br>
To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.<br>
Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,<br>
To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;<br>
Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,<br>
And work confusion on his enemies.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They knock</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus, above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Who doth molest my contemplation?<br>
Is it your trick to make me ope the door,<br>
That so my sad decrees may fly away,<br>
And all my study be to no effect?<br>
You are deceived: for what I mean to do<br>
See here in bloody lines I have set down;<br>
And what is written shall be executed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Titus, I am come to talk with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,<br>
Wanting a hand to give it action?<br>
Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">I am not mad; I know thee well enough:<br>
Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;<br>
Witness these trenches made by grief and care,<br>
Witness the tiring day and heavy night;<br>
Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well<br>
For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:<br>
Is not thy coming for my other hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;<br>
She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:<br>
I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,<br>
To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,<br>
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.<br>
Come down, and welcome me to this world&#8217;s light;<br>
Confer with me of murder and of death:<br>
There&#8217;s not a hollow cave or lurking-place,<br>
No vast obscurity or misty vale,<br>
Where bloody murder or detested rape<br>
Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;<br>
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,<br>
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,<br>
To be a torment to mine enemies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Do me some service, ere I come to thee.<br>
Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;<br>
Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,<br>
Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;<br>
And then I&#8217;ll come and be thy waggoner,<br>
And whirl along with thee about the globe.<br>
Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,<br>
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,<br>
And find out murderers in their guilty caves:<br>
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,<br>
I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel<br>
Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,<br>
Even from Hyperion&#8217;s rising in the east<br>
Until his very downfall in the sea:<br>
And day by day I&#8217;ll do this heavy task,<br>
So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">These are my ministers, and come with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Are these thy ministers? what are they
call&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,<br>
Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Good Lord, how like the empress&#8217; sons they
are!<br>
And you, the empress! but we worldly men<br>
Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.<br>
O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;<br>
And, if one arm&#8217;s embracement will content thee,<br>
I will embrace thee in it by and by.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit above</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">This closing with him fits his lunacy<br>
Whate&#8217;er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,<br>
Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,<br>
For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;<br>
And, being credulous in this mad thought,<br>
I&#8217;ll make him send for Lucius his son;<br>
And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,<br>
I&#8217;ll find some cunning practise out of hand,<br>
To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,<br>
Or, at the least, make them his enemies.<br>
See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus below</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:<br>
Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:<br>
Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.<br>
How like the empress and her sons you are!<br>
Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:<br>
Could not all hell afford you such a devil?<br>
For well I wot the empress never wags<br>
But in her company there is a Moor;<br>
And, would you represent our queen aright,<br>
It were convenient you had such a devil:<br>
But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Show me a murderer, I&#8217;ll deal with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Show me a villain that hath done a rape,<br>
And I am sent to be revenged on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,<br>
And I will be revenged on them all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;<br>
And when thou find&#8217;st a man that&#8217;s like thyself.<br>
Good Murder, stab him; he&#8217;s a murderer.<br>
Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap<br>
To find another that is like to thee,<br>
Good Rapine, stab him; he&#8217;s a ravisher.<br>
Go thou with them; and in the emperor&#8217;s court<br>
There is a queen, attended by a Moor;<br>
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,<br>
for up and down she doth resemble thee:<br>
I pray thee, do on them some violent death;<br>
They have been violent to me and mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Well hast thou lesson&#8217;d us; this shall we
do.<br>
But would it please thee, good Andronicus,<br>
To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,<br>
Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,<br>
And bid him come and banquet at thy house;<br>
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,<br>
I will bring in the empress and her sons,<br>
The emperor himself and all thy foes;<br>
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,<br>
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.<br>
What says Andronicus to this device?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Marcus, my brother! &#8217;tis sad Titus
calls.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Marcus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;<br>
Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:<br>
Bid him repair to me, and bring with him<br>
Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;<br>
Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:<br>
Tell him the emperor and the empress too<br>
Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.<br>
This do thou for my love; and so let him,<br>
As he regards his aged father&#8217;s life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">This will I do, and soon return again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Now will I hence about thy business,<br>
And take my ministers along with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;<br>
Or else I&#8217;ll call my brother back again,<br>
And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to her sons]</span>
What say you, boys? will you
bide with him,<br>
Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor<br>
How I have govern&#8217;d our determined jest?<br>
Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,<br>
And tarry with him till I turn again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I know them
all, though they suppose me mad,<br>
And will o&#8217;erreach them in their own devices:<br>
A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!</p>

<p class="speech">Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes<br>
To lay a complot to betray thy foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge,
farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Tamora</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Tell us, old man, how shall we be
employ&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I have work enough for you to do.<br>
Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Publius and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">What is your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Know you these two?</p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">The empress&#8217; sons, I take them, Chiron and
Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much
deceived;<br>
The one is Murder, Rape is the other&#8217;s name;<br>
And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.<br>
Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.<br>
Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,<br>
And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,<br>
And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Publius, &amp; c. lay hold on
Chiron and Demetrius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Villains, forbear! we are the empress&#8217;
sons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore do we what we are commanded.<br>
Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.<br>
Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Titus, with Lavinia;
he bearing a knife, and she a basin</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are
bound.<br>
Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;<br>
But let them hear what fearful words I utter.<br>
O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!<br>
Here stands the spring whom you have stain&#8217;d with mud,<br>
This goodly summer with your winter mix&#8217;d.<br>
You kill&#8217;d her husband, and for that vile fault<br>
Two of her brothers were condemn&#8217;d to death,<br>
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;<br>
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear<br>
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,<br>
Inhuman traitors, you constrain&#8217;d and forced.<br>
What would you say, if I should let you speak?<br>
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.<br>
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.<br>
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,<br>
Whilst that Lavinia &#8217;tween her stumps doth hold<br>
The basin that receives your guilty blood.<br>
You know your mother means to feast with me,<br>
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:<br>
Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust<br>
And with your blood and it I&#8217;ll make a paste,<br>
And of the paste a coffin I will rear<br>
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,<br>
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow&#8217;d dam,<br>
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.<br>
This is the feast that I have bid her to,<br>
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;<br>
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,<br>
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:<br>
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He cuts their
throats</span></p>
<p class="speech">Receive the blood: and when that they are
dead,<br>
Let me go grind their bones to powder small<br>
And with this hateful liquor temper it;<br>
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.<br>
Come, come, be every one officious<br>
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove<br>
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs&#8217; feast.<br>
So, now bring them in, for I&#8217;ll play the cook,<br>
And see them ready &#8217;gainst their mother comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt, bearing the dead
bodies</span></p>

<h4>Scene III. Court of Titus&#8217;s house. A banquet set
out.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius, Marcus, and
Goths, with Aaron prisoner</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Uncle Marcus, since it is my father&#8217;s
mind<br>
That I repair to Rome, I am content.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Goth</p>
<p class="speech">And ours with thine, befall what fortune
will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,<br>
This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;<br>
Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him<br>
Till he be brought unto the empress&#8217; face,<br>
For testimony of her foul proceedings:<br>
And see the ambush of our friends be strong;<br>
I fear the emperor means no good to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,<br>
And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth<br>
The venomous malice of my swelling heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Away, inhuman dog! unhallow&#8217;d slave!<br>
Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Goths, with Aaron.
Flourish within</span></p>
<p class="speech">The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Saturninus and Tamora,
with Aemilius, Tribunes, Senators, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">What, hath the firmament more suns than one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Rome&#8217;s emperor, and nephew, break the
parle;<br>
These quarrels must be quietly debated.<br>
The feast is ready, which the careful Titus<br>
Hath ordain&#8217;d to an honourable end,<br>
For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:<br>
Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Marcus, we will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hautboys sound. The Company
sit down at table</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Titus dressed like a
Cook, Lavinia veiled, Young Lucius, and others. Titus places the
dishes on the table</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread
queen;<br>
Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;<br>
And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,<br>
&#8217;Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Because I would be sure to have all well,<br>
To entertain your highness and your empress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">An if your highness knew my heart, you were.<br>
My lord the emperor, resolve me this:<br>
Was it well done of rash Virginius<br>
To slay his daughter with his own right hand,<br>
Because she was enforced, stain&#8217;d, and deflower&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">It was, Andronicus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Your reason, mighty lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Because the girl should not survive her
shame,<br>
And by her presence still renew his sorrows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;<br>
A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,<br>
For me, most wretched, to perform the like.<br>
Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kills Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, with thy shame, thy father&#8217;s sorrow
die!</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Kill&#8217;d her, for whom my tears have made me
blind.<br>
I am as woful as Virginius was,<br>
And have a thousand times more cause than he<br>
To do this outrage: and it now is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">What, was she ravish&#8217;d? tell who did the
deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please you eat? will&#8217;t please
your
highness feed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Not I; &#8217;twas Chiron and Demetrius:<br>
They ravish&#8217;d her, and cut away her tongue;<br>
And they, &#8217;twas they, that did her all this wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Go fetch them hither to us presently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;<br>
Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,<br>
Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.<br>
&#8217;Tis true, &#8217;tis true; witness my knife&#8217;s sharp
point.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kills Tamora</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kills Titus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Can the son&#8217;s eye behold his father
bleed?<br>
There&#8217;s meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kills Saturninus. A great
tumult. Lucius, Marcus, and others go up into the
balcony</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,<br>
By uproar sever&#8217;d, like a flight of fowl<br>
Scatter&#8217;d by winds and high tempestuous gusts,<br>
O, let me teach you how to knit again<br>
This scatter&#8217;d corn into one mutual sheaf,<br>
These broken limbs again into one body;<br>
Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,<br>
And she whom mighty kingdoms court&#8217;sy to,<br>
Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,<br>
Do shameful execution on herself.<br>
But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,<br>
Grave witnesses of true experience,<br>
Cannot induce you to attend my words,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speech">Speak, Rome&#8217;s dear friend, as erst our
ancestor,<br>
When with his solemn tongue he did discourse<br>
To love-sick Dido&#8217;s sad attending ear<br>
The story of that baleful burning night<br>
When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam&#8217;s Troy,<br>
Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch&#8217;d our ears,<br>
Or who hath brought the fatal engine in<br>
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.<br>
My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;<br>
Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,<br>
But floods of tears will drown my oratory,<br>
And break my utterance, even in the time<br>
When it should move you to attend me most,<br>
Lending your kind commiseration.<br>
Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;<br>
Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,<br>
That cursed Chiron and Demetrius<br>
Were they that murdered our emperor&#8217;s brother;<br>
And they it were that ravished our sister:<br>
For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;<br>
Our father&#8217;s tears despised, and basely cozen&#8217;d<br>
Of that true hand that fought Rome&#8217;s quarrel out,<br>
And sent her enemies unto the grave.<br>
Lastly, myself unkindly banished,<br>
The gates shut on me, and turn&#8217;d weeping out,<br>
To beg relief among Rome&#8217;s enemies:<br>
Who drown&#8217;d their enmity in my true tears.<br>
And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.<br>
I am the turned forth, be it known to you,<br>
That have preserved her welfare in my blood;<br>
And from her bosom took the enemy&#8217;s point,<br>
Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.<br>
Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;<br>
My scars can witness, dumb although they are,<br>
That my report is just and full of truth.<br>
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,<br>
Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;<br>
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to the Child in the
arms of an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Of this was Tamora delivered;<br>
The issue of an irreligious Moor,<br>
Chief architect and plotter of these woes:<br>
The villain is alive in Titus&#8217; house,<br>
And as he is, to witness this is true.<br>
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge<br>
These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,<br>
Or more than any living man could bear.<br>
Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?<br>
Have we done aught amiss,&#8212;show us wherein,<br>
And, from the place where you behold us now,<br>
The poor remainder of Andronici<br>
Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.<br>
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,<br>
And make a mutual closure of our house.<br>
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,<br>
Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemilius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,<br>
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,<br>
Lucius our emperor; for well I know<br>
The common voice do cry it shall be so.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Lucius, all hail, Rome&#8217;s royal emperor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go into old Titus&#8217; sorrowful house,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,<br>
To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,<br>
As punishment for his most wicked life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lucius, Marcus, and the
others descend</span></p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Lucius, all hail, Rome&#8217;s gracious
governor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,<br>
To heal Rome&#8217;s harms, and wipe away her woe!<br>
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,<br>
For nature puts me to a heavy task:<br>
Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,<br>
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.<br>
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing Titus</span></p>
<p class="speech">These sorrowful drops upon thy
blood-stain&#8217;d face,<br>
The last true duties of thy noble son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,<br>
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:<br>
O were the sum of these that I should pay<br>
Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us<br>
To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:<br>
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,<br>
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:<br>
Many a matter hath he told to thee,<br>
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;<br>
In that respect, then, like a loving child,<br>
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,<br>
Because kind nature doth require it so:<br>
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:<br>
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;<br>
Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my
heart<br>
Would I were dead, so you did live again!<br>
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;<br>
My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendants with
Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aemilius</p>
<p class="speech">You sad Andronici, have done with woes:<br>
Give sentence on this execrable wretch,<br>
That hath been breeder of these dire events.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;<br>
There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;<br>
If any one relieves or pities him,<br>
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:<br>
Some stay to see him fasten&#8217;d in the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?<br>
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers<br>
I should repent the evils I have done:<br>
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did<br>
Would I perform, if I might have my will;<br>
If one good deed in all my life I did,<br>
I do repent it from my very soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,<br>
And give him burial in his father&#8217;s grave:<br>
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith<br>
Be closed in our household&#8217;s monument.<br>
As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,<br>
No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,<br>
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;<br>
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:<br>
Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;<br>
And, being so, shall have like want of pity.<br>
See justice done on Aaron, that damn&#8217;d Moor,<br>
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:<br>
Then, afterwards, to order well the state,<br>
That like events may ne&#8217;er it ruinate.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
