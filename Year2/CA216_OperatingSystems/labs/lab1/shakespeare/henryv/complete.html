<h4>Prologue</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Chorus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Chorus</p>
<p class="speech">O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend<br>
The brightest heaven of invention,<br>
A kingdom for a stage, princes to act<br>
And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!<br>
Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,<br>
Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,<br>
Leash&#8217;d in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire<br>
Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,<br>
The flat unraised spirits that have dared<br>
On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth<br>
So great an object: can this cockpit hold<br>
The vasty fields of France? or may we cram<br>
Within this wooden O the very casques<br>
That did affright the air at Agincourt?<br>
O, pardon! since a crooked figure may<br>
Attest in little place a million;<br>
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,<br>
On your imaginary forces work.<br>
Suppose within the girdle of these walls<br>
Are now confined two mighty monarchies,<br>
Whose high upreared and abutting fronts<br>
The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:<br>
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;<br>
Into a thousand parts divide on man,<br>
And make imaginary puissance;<br>
Think when we talk of horses, that you see them<br>
Printing their proud hoofs i&#8217; the receiving earth;<br>
For &#8217;tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,<br>
Carry them here and there; jumping o&#8217;er times,<br>
Turning the accomplishment of many years<br>
Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,<br>
Admit me Chorus to this history;<br>
Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,<br>
Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.</p>

<h4>Scene I. London. An ante-chamber in the King&#8217;s
palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Archbishop Of
Canterbury, and the Bishop Of Ely</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I&#8217;ll tell you; that self bill is
urged,<br>
Which in the eleventh year of the last king&#8217;s reign<br>
Was like, and had indeed against us pass&#8217;d,<br>
But that the scambling and unquiet time<br>
Did push it out of farther question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">It must be thought on. If it pass against us,<br>
We lose the better half of our possession:<br>
For all the temporal lands which men devout<br>
By testament have given to the church<br>
Would they strip from us; being valued thus:<br>
As much as would maintain, to the king&#8217;s honour,<br>
Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,<br>
Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;<br>
And, to relief of lazars and weak age,<br>
Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.<br>
A hundred almshouses right well supplied;<br>
And to the coffers of the king beside,<br>
A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">This would drink deep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twould drink the cup and all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">But what prevention?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">The king is full of grace and fair regard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">And a true lover of the holy church.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">The courses of his youth promised it not.<br>
The breath no sooner left his father&#8217;s body,<br>
But that his wildness, mortified in him,<br>
Seem&#8217;d to die too; yea, at that very moment<br>
Consideration, like an angel, came<br>
And whipp&#8217;d the offending Adam out of him,<br>
Leaving his body as a paradise,<br>
To envelop and contain celestial spirits.<br>
Never was such a sudden scholar made;<br>
Never came reformation in a flood,<br>
With such a heady currance, scouring faults<br>
Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness<br>
So soon did lose his seat and all at once<br>
As in this king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We are blessed in the change.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">Hear him but reason in divinity,<br>
And all-admiring with an inward wish<br>
You would desire the king were made a prelate:<br>
Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,<br>
You would say it hath been all in all his study:<br>
List his discourse of war, and you shall hear<br>
A fearful battle render&#8217;d you in music:<br>
Turn him to any cause of policy,<br>
The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,<br>
Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,<br>
The air, a charter&#8217;d libertine, is still,<br>
And the mute wonder lurketh in men&#8217;s ears,<br>
To steal his sweet and honey&#8217;d sentences;<br>
So that the art and practic part of life<br>
Must be the mistress to this theoric:<br>
Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,<br>
Since his addiction was to courses vain,<br>
His companies unletter&#8217;d, rude and shallow,<br>
His hours fill&#8217;d up with riots, banquets, sports,<br>
And never noted in him any study,<br>
Any retirement, any sequestration<br>
From open haunts and popularity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">The strawberry grows underneath the nettle<br>
And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best<br>
Neighbour&#8217;d by fruit of baser quality:<br>
And so the prince obscured his contemplation<br>
Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,<br>
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,<br>
Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">It must be so; for miracles are ceased;<br>
And therefore we must needs admit the means<br>
How things are perfected.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">But, my good lord,<br>
How now for mitigation of this bill<br>
Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty<br>
Incline to it, or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">He seems indifferent,<br>
Or rather swaying more upon our part<br>
Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;<br>
For I have made an offer to his majesty,<br>
Upon our spiritual convocation<br>
And in regard of causes now in hand,<br>
Which I have open&#8217;d to his grace at large,<br>
As touching France, to give a greater sum<br>
Than ever at one time the clergy yet<br>
Did to his predecessors part withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">How did this offer seem received, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">With good acceptance of his majesty;<br>
Save that there was not time enough to hear,<br>
As I perceived his grace would fain have done,<br>
The severals and unhidden passages<br>
Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms<br>
And generally to the crown and seat of France<br>
Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">What was the impediment that broke this off?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">The French ambassador upon that instant<br>
Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come<br>
To give him hearing: is it four o&#8217;clock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">It is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">Then go we in, to know his embassy;<br>
Which I could with a ready guess declare,<br>
Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll wait upon you, and I long to hear
it.</p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. The Presence chamber.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry V,
Gloucester, Bedford, Exeter, Warwick, Westmoreland, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Not here in presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Send for him, good uncle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,<br>
Before we hear him, of some things of weight<br>
That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Archbishop Of
Canterbury, and the Bishop of Ely</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">God and his angels guard your sacred throne<br>
And make you long become it!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Sure, we thank you.<br>
My learned lord, we pray you to proceed<br>
And justly and religiously unfold<br>
Why the law Salique that they have in France<br>
Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:<br>
And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,<br>
That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,<br>
Or nicely charge your understanding soul<br>
With opening titles miscreate, whose right<br>
Suits not in native colours with the truth;<br>
For God doth know how many now in health<br>
Shall drop their blood in approbation<br>
Of what your reverence shall incite us to.<br>
Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,<br>
How you awake our sleeping sword of war:<br>
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;<br>
For never two such kingdoms did contend<br>
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops<br>
Are every one a woe, a sore complaint<br>
&#8217;Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords<br>
That make such waste in brief mortality.<br>
Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;<br>
For we will hear, note and believe in heart<br>
That what you speak is in your conscience wash&#8217;d<br>
As pure as sin with baptism.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you
peers,<br>
That owe yourselves, your lives and services<br>
To this imperial throne. There is no bar<br>
To make against your highness&#8217; claim to France<br>
But this, which they produce from Pharamond,<br>
&#8216;In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:&#8217;<br>
&#8216;No woman shall succeed in Salique land:&#8217;<br>
Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze<br>
To be the realm of France, and Pharamond<br>
The founder of this law and female bar.<br>
Yet their own authors faithfully affirm<br>
That the land Salique is in Germany,<br>
Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;<br>
Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,<br>
There left behind and settled certain French;<br>
Who, holding in disdain the German women<br>
For some dishonest manners of their life,<br>
Establish&#8217;d then this law; to wit, no female<br>
Should be inheritrix in Salique land:<br>
Which Salique, as I said, &#8217;twixt Elbe and Sala,<br>
Is at this day in Germany call&#8217;d Meisen.<br>
Then doth it well appear that Salique law<br>
Was not devised for the realm of France:<br>
Nor did the French possess the Salique land<br>
Until four hundred one and twenty years<br>
After defunction of King Pharamond,<br>
Idly supposed the founder of this law;<br>
Who died within the year of our redemption<br>
Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great<br>
Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French<br>
Beyond the river Sala, in the year<br>
Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,<br>
King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,<br>
Did, as heir general, being descended<br>
Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,<br>
Make claim and title to the crown of France.<br>
Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown<br>
Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male<br>
Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,<br>
To find his title with some shows of truth,<br>
Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,<br>
Convey&#8217;d himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,<br>
Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son<br>
To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son<br>
Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,<br>
Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,<br>
Could not keep quiet in his conscience,<br>
Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied<br>
That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,<br>
Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,<br>
Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:<br>
By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great<br>
Was re-united to the crown of France.<br>
So that, as clear as is the summer&#8217;s sun.<br>
King Pepin&#8217;s title and Hugh Capet&#8217;s claim,<br>
King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear<br>
To hold in right and title of the female:<br>
So do the kings of France unto this day;<br>
Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law<br>
To bar your highness claiming from the female,<br>
And rather choose to hide them in a net<br>
Than amply to imbar their crooked titles<br>
Usurp&#8217;d from you and your progenitors.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">May I with right and conscience make this
claim?</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!<br>
For in the book of Numbers is it writ,<br>
When the man dies, let the inheritance<br>
Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,<br>
Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;<br>
Look back into your mighty ancestors:<br>
Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire&#8217;s tomb,<br>
From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,<br>
And your great-uncle&#8217;s, Edward the Black Prince,<br>
Who on the French ground play&#8217;d a tragedy,<br>
Making defeat on the full power of France,<br>
Whiles his most mighty father on a hill<br>
Stood smiling to behold his lion&#8217;s whelp<br>
Forage in blood of French nobility.<br>
O noble English. that could entertain<br>
With half their forces the full Pride of France<br>
And let another half stand laughing by,<br>
All out of work and cold for action!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ely</p>
<p class="speech">Awake remembrance of these valiant dead<br>
And with your puissant arm renew their feats:<br>
You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;<br>
The blood and courage that renowned them<br>
Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege<br>
Is in the very May-morn of his youth,<br>
Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth<br>
Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,<br>
As did the former lions of your blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">They know your grace hath cause and means and
might;<br>
So hath your highness; never king of England<br>
Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,<br>
Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England<br>
And lie pavilion&#8217;d in the fields of France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,<br>
With blood and sword and fire to win your right;<br>
In aid whereof we of the spiritualty<br>
Will raise your highness such a mighty sum<br>
As never did the clergy at one time<br>
Bring in to any of your ancestors.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We must not only arm to invade the French,<br>
But lay down our proportions to defend<br>
Against the Scot, who will make road upon us<br>
With all advantages.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">They of those marches, gracious sovereign,<br>
Shall be a wall sufficient to defend<br>
Our inland from the pilfering borderers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,<br>
But fear the main intendment of the Scot,<br>
Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;<br>
For you shall read that my great-grandfather<br>
Never went with his forces into France<br>
But that the Scot on his unfurnish&#8217;d kingdom<br>
Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,<br>
With ample and brim fulness of his force,<br>
Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,<br>
Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;<br>
That England, being empty of defence,<br>
Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">She hath been then more fear&#8217;d than
harm&#8217;d, my liege;<br>
For hear her but exampled by herself:<br>
When all her chivalry hath been in France<br>
And she a mourning widow of her nobles,<br>
She hath herself not only well defended<br>
But taken and impounded as a stray<br>
The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,<br>
To fill King Edward&#8217;s fame with prisoner kings<br>
And make her chronicle as rich with praise<br>
As is the ooze and bottom of the sea<br>
With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">But there&#8217;s a saying very old and true,<br>
&#8216;If that you will France win,<br>
Then with Scotland first begin:&#8217;<br>
For once the eagle England being in prey,<br>
To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot<br>
Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,<br>
Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,<br>
To tear and havoc more than she can eat.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">It follows then the cat must stay at home:<br>
Yet that is but a crush&#8217;d necessity,<br>
Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,<br>
And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.<br>
While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,<br>
The advised head defends itself at home;<br>
For government, though high and low and lower,<br>
Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,<br>
Congreeing in a full and natural close,<br>
Like music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Canterbury</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Therefore doth heaven divide<br>
The state of man in divers functions,<br>
Setting endeavour in continual motion;<br>
To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,<br>
Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,<br>
Creatures that by a rule in nature teach<br>
The act of order to a peopled kingdom.<br>
They have a king and officers of sorts;<br>
Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,<br>
Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,<br>
Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,<br>
Make boot upon the summer&#8217;s velvet buds,<br>
Which pillage they with merry march bring home<br>
To the tent-royal of their emperor;<br>
Who, busied in his majesty, surveys<br>
The singing masons building roofs of gold,<br>
The civil citizens kneading up the honey,<br>
The poor mechanic porters crowding in<br>
Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,<br>
The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,<br>
Delivering o&#8217;er to executors pale<br>
The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,<br>
That many things, having full reference<br>
To one consent, may work contrariously:<br>
As many arrows, loosed several ways,<br>
Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;<br>
As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;<br>
As many lines close in the dial&#8217;s centre;<br>
So may a thousand actions, once afoot.<br>
End in one purpose, and be all well borne<br>
Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.<br>
Divide your happy England into four;<br>
Whereof take you one quarter into France,<br>
And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.<br>
If we, with thrice such powers left at home,<br>
Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,<br>
Let us be worried and our nation lose<br>
The name of hardiness and policy.</p>

help,<br>
And yours, the noble sinews of our power,<br>
France being ours, we&#8217;ll bend it to our awe,<br>
Or break it all to pieces: or there we&#8217;ll sit,<br>
Ruling in large and ample empery<br>
O&#8217;er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,<br>
Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,<br>
Tombless, with no remembrance over them:<br>
Either our history shall with full mouth<br>
Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,<br>
Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,<br>
Not worshipp&#8217;d with a waxen epitaph.</p>

Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear<br>
Your greeting is from him, not from the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Ambassador</p>
<p class="speech">May&#8217;t please your majesty to give us
leave<br>
Freely to render what we have in charge;<br>
Or shall we sparingly show you far off<br>
The Dauphin&#8217;s meaning and our embassy?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;<br>
Unto whose grace our passion is as subject<br>
As are our wretches fetter&#8217;d in our prisons:<br>
Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness<br>
Tell us the Dauphin&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Ambassador</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, then, in few.<br>
Your highness, lately sending into France,<br>
Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right<br>
Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.<br>
In answer of which claim, the prince our master<br>
Says that you savour too much of your youth,<br>
And bids you be advised there&#8217;s nought in France<br>
That can be with a nimble galliard won;<br>
You cannot revel into dukedoms there.<br>
He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,<br>
This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,<br>
Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim<br>
Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">What treasure, uncle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Tennis-balls, my liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with
us;<br>
His present and your pains we thank you for:<br>
When we have march&#8217;d our rackets to these balls,<br>
We will, in France, by God&#8217;s grace, play a set<br>
Shall strike his father&#8217;s crown into the hazard.<br>
Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler<br>
That all the courts of France will be disturb&#8217;d<br>
With chaces. And we understand him well,<br>
How he comes o&#8217;er us with our wilder days,<br>
Not measuring what use we made of them.<br>
We never valued this poor seat of England;<br>
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself<br>
To barbarous licence; as &#8217;tis ever common<br>
That men are merriest when they are from home.<br>
But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,<br>
Be like a king and show my sail of greatness<br>
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:<br>
For that I have laid by my majesty<br>
And plodded like a man for working-days,<br>
But I will rise there with so full a glory<br>
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,<br>
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.<br>
And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his<br>
Hath turn&#8217;d his balls to gun-stones; and his soul<br>
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance<br>
That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows<br>
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;<br>
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;<br>
And some are yet ungotten and unborn<br>
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin&#8217;s scorn.<br>
But this lies all within the will of God,<br>
To whom I do appeal; and in whose name<br>
Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,<br>
To venge me as I may and to put forth<br>
My rightful hand in a well-hallow&#8217;d cause.<br>
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin<br>
His jest will savour but of shallow wit,<br>
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.<br>
Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Ambassadors</span></p>

<p class="speech">This was a merry message.</p>

<p class="speech">We hope to make the sender blush at it.<br>
Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour<br>
That may give furtherance to our expedition;<br>
For we have now no thought in us but France,<br>
Save those to God, that run before our business.<br>
Therefore let our proportions for these wars<br>
Be soon collected and all things thought upon<br>
That may with reasonable swiftness add<br>
More feathers to our wings; for, God before,<br>
We&#8217;ll chide this Dauphin at his father&#8217;s door.<br>
Therefore let every man now task his thought,<br>

<p class="speaker">Chorus</p>
<p class="speech">Now all the youth of England are on fire,<br>
And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:<br>
Now thrive the armourers, and honour&#8217;s thought<br>
Reigns solely in the breast of every man:<br>
They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,<br>
Following the mirror of all Christian kings,<br>
With winged heels, as English Mercuries.<br>
For now sits Expectation in the air,<br>
And hides a sword from hilts unto the point<br>
With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,<br>
Promised to Harry and his followers.<br>
The French, advised by good intelligence<br>
Of this most dreadful preparation,<br>
Shake in their fear and with pale policy<br>
Seek to divert the English purposes.<br>
O England! model to thy inward greatness,<br>
Like little body with a mighty heart,<br>
What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,<br>
Were all thy children kind and natural!<br>
But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out<br>
A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills<br>
With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,<br>
One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,<br>
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,<br>
Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,<br>
Have, for the gilt of France,&#8212;O guilt indeed!<br>
Confirm&#8217;d conspiracy with fearful France;<br>
And by their hands this grace of kings must die,<br>
If hell and treason hold their promises,<br>
Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.<br>
Linger your patience on; and we&#8217;ll digest<br>
The abuse of distance; force a play:<br>
The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;<br>
The king is set from London; and the scene<br>
Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;<br>
There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:<br>
And thence to France shall we convey you safe,<br>
And bring you back, charming the narrow seas<br>
To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,<br>
We&#8217;ll not offend one stomach with our play.<br>
But, till the king come forth, and not till then,<br>
Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.</p>

<p class="speech">Well met, Corporal Nym.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>

<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">For my part, I care not: I say little; but
when
time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
endure cold as another man&#8217;s sword will: and
there&#8217;s an end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends;
and
we&#8217;ll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
be so, good Corporal Nym.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, I will live so long as I may, that&#8217;s
the
certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
rendezvous of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">It is certain, corporal, that he is married to
Nell
Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
were troth-plight to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men
may
sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
cannot tell.</p>

<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Base tike, call&#8217;st thou me host? Now, by
this hand,<br>
I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hostess</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge
and
board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.</p>

The &#8216;solus&#8217; in thy most mervailous face;<br>
The &#8216;solus&#8217; in thy teeth, and in thy throat,<br>
And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,<br>
And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!<br>
I do retort the &#8216;solus&#8217; in thy bowels;<br>
For I can take, and Pistol&#8217;s cock is up,<br>
And flashing fire will follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nym</p>
<p class="speech">I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have
an
humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
terms, as I may: and that&#8217;s the humour of it.</p>

<p class="speech">O braggart vile and damned furious wight!<br>
The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;<br>
Therefore exhale.</p>

fair
terms: that is the humour of it.</p>

That is the word. I thee defy again.<br>
O hound of Crete, think&#8217;st thou my spouse to get?<br>
No; to the spital go,<br>
And from the powdering tub of infamy<br>
Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid&#8217;s kind,<br>
Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:<br>
I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly<br>

you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he&#8217;s very ill.</p>

<p class="speech">Away, you rogue!</p>

These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,<br>
You know how apt our love was to accord<br>
To furnish him with all appertinents<br>
Belonging to his honour; and this man<br>
Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,<br>
And sworn unto the practises of France,<br>
To kill us here in Hampton: to the which<br>
This knight, no less for bounty bound to us<br>
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,<br>
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,<br>
Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!<br>
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,<br>
That knew&#8217;st the very bottom of my soul,<br>
That almost mightst have coin&#8217;d me into gold,<br>
Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,<br>
May it be possible, that foreign hire<br>
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil<br>
That might annoy my finger? &#8217;tis so strange,<br>
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross<br>
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.<br>
Treason and murder ever kept together,<br>
As two yoke-devils sworn to either&#8217;s purpose,<br>
Working so grossly in a natural cause,<br>
That admiration did not whoop at them:<br>
But thou, &#8217;gainst all proportion, didst bring in<br>
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:<br>
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was<br>
That wrought upon thee so preposterously<br>
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:<br>
All other devils that suggest by treasons<br>
Do botch and bungle up damnation<br>
With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch&#8217;d<br>
From glistering semblances of piety;<br>
But he that temper&#8217;d thee bade thee stand up,<br>
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,<br>
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.<br>
If that same demon that hath gull&#8217;d thee thus<br>
Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,<br>
He might return to vasty Tartar back,<br>
And tell the legions &#8216;I can never win<br>
A soul so easy as that Englishman&#8217;s.&#8217;<br>
O, how hast thou with jealousy infected<br>
The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?<br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?<br>
Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?<br>
Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?<br>
Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,<br>
Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,<br>
Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,<br>
Garnish&#8217;d and deck&#8217;d in modest complement,<br>
Not working with the eye without the ear,<br>
And but in purged judgment trusting neither?<br>
Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:<br>
And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,<br>
To mark the full-fraught man and best indued<br>
With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;<br>
For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like<br>
Another fall of man. Their faults are open:<br>
Arrest them to the answer of the law;<br>
And God acquit them of their practises!</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>

Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,<br>
His princes and his peers to servitude,<br>
His subjects to oppression and contempt<br>
And his whole kingdom into desolation.<br>
Touching our person seek we no revenge;<br>
But we our kingdom&#8217;s safety must so tender,<br>
Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws<br>
We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,<br>
Poor miserable wretches, to your death:<br>
The taste whereof, God of his mercy give<br>
You patience to endure, and true repentance<br>
Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.</p>

Grey, guarded</span></p>

Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.<br>

This dangerous treason lurking in our way<br>
To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now<br>
But every rub is smoothed on our way.<br>
Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver<br>
Our puissance into the hand of God,<br>
Putting it straight in expedition.<br>
Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:<br>
No king of England, if not king of France.</p>

a finer end and went away an it had been any
christom child; a&#8217; parted even just between twelve

I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
flowers and smile upon his fingers&#8217; ends, I knew
there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as
a pen, and a&#8217; babbled of green fields. &#8216;How now,
sir John!&#8217; quoth I &#8216;what, man! be o&#8217; good
cheer.&#8217; So a&#8217; cried out &#8216;God, God, God!&#8217;
three or
four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a&#8217;
should not think of God; I hoped there was no need
to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
a&#8217; bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and
they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and

<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Thus comes the English with full power upon
us;<br>
And more than carefully it us concerns<br>
To answer royally in our defences.<br>
Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,<br>
Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,<br>
And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,<br>
To line and new repair our towns of war<br>
With men of courage and with means defendant;<br>

<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>

It is most meet we arm us &#8217;gainst the foe;<br>
For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,<br>
Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,<br>
But that defences, musters, preparations,<br>
Should be maintain&#8217;d, assembled and collected,<br>
As were a war in expectation.<br>
Therefore, I say &#8217;tis meet we all go forth<br>
To view the sick and feeble parts of France:<br>
And let us do it with no show of fear;<br>
No, with no more than if we heard that England<br>
Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:<br>
For, my good liege, she is so idly king&#8217;d,<br>
Her sceptre so fantastically borne<br>
By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,<br>
That fear attends her not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">O peace, Prince Dauphin!<br>
You are too much mistaken in this king:<br>
Question your grace the late ambassadors,<br>
With what great state he heard their embassy,<br>
How well supplied with noble counsellors,<br>
How modest in exception, and withal<br>
How terrible in constant resolution,<br>
And you shall find his vanities forespent<br>
Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,<br>
Covering discretion with a coat of folly;<br>
As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots<br>
That shall first spring and be most delicate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Well, &#8217;tis not so, my lord high
constable;<br>
But though we think it so, it is no matter:<br>
In cases of defence &#8217;tis best to weigh<br>
The enemy more mighty than he seems:<br>
So the proportions of defence are fill&#8217;d;<br>

That haunted us in our familiar paths:<br>
Witness our too much memorable shame<br>
When Cressy battle fatally was struck,<br>
And all our princes captiv&#8217;d by the hand<br>
Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;<br>
Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,<br>
Up in the air, crown&#8217;d with the golden sun,<br>
Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,<br>
Mangle the work of nature and deface<br>
The patterns that by God and by French fathers<br>
Had twenty years been made. This is a stem<br>

That you divest yourself, and lay apart<br>
The borrow&#8217;d glories that by gift of heaven,<br>
By law of nature and of nations, &#8217;long<br>
To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown<br>
And all wide-stretched honours that pertain<br>
By custom and the ordinance of times<br>
Unto the crown of France. That you may know<br>
&#8217;Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,<br>
Pick&#8217;d from the worm-holes of long-vanish&#8217;d days,<br>
Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,<br>
He sends you this most memorable line,<br>
In every branch truly demonstrative;<br>
Willing to overlook this pedigree:<br>
And when you find him evenly derived<br>
From his most famed of famous ancestors,<br>
Edward the Third, he bids you then resign<br>
Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held<br>
From him the native and true challenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Of France</p>
<p class="speech">Or else what follows?</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown<br>
Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:<br>
Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,<br>
In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,<br>
That, if requiring fail, he will compel;<br>
And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,<br>
Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy<br>
On the poor souls for whom this hungry war<br>
Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head<br>
Turning the widows&#8217; tears, the orphans&#8217; cries<br>
The dead men&#8217;s blood, the pining maidens groans,<br>
For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,<br>
That shall be swallow&#8217;d in this controversy.<br>
This is his claim, his threatening and my message;<br>
Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,<br>
To whom expressly I bring greeting too.</p>

And any thing that may not misbecome<br>
The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.<br>
Thus says my king; an&#8217; if your father&#8217;s highness<br>
Do not, in grant of all demands at large,<br>
Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,<br>
He&#8217;ll call you to so hot an answer of it,<br>
That caves and womby vaultages of France<br>
Shall chide your trespass and return your mock<br>
In second accent of his ordnance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Say, if my father render fair return,<br>
It is against my will; for I desire<br>
Nothing but odds with England: to that end,<br>
As matching to his youth and vanity,<br>
I did present him with the Paris balls.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll make your Paris Louvre shake for

Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:<br>
And, be assured, you&#8217;ll find a difference,<br>
As we his subjects have in wonder found,<br>
Between the promise of his greener days<br>
And these he masters now: now he weighs time<br>
Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read<br>

<p class="speech">As young as I am, I have observed these three
swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
three, though they would serve me, could not be man
to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
red-faced; by the means whereof a&#8217; faces it out, but
fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a&#8217; breaks
words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
heard that men of few words are the best men; and
therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a&#8217;
should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
are matched with as few good deeds; for a&#8217; never
broke any man&#8217;s head but his own, and that was
against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
men would carry coals. They would have me as
familiar with men&#8217;s pockets as their gloves or their
handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
if I should take from another&#8217;s pocket to put into
mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
must leave them, and seek some better service:
their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
therefore I must cast it up.</p>

concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,
the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look
you, is digt himself four yard under the

<p class="speaker">Gower</p>

the

&#8217;tis shame for us all: so God sa&#8217; me, &#8217;tis shame

throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there

<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than

you do not use me with that affability as in
discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in

is
painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
Fortune is an excellent moral.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pistol</p>
<p class="speech">Fortune is Bardolph&#8217;s foe, and frowns on
him;<br>
For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a&#8217; be:<br>
A damned death!<br>
Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free<br>
And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:<br>
But Exeter hath given the doom of death<br>
For pax of little price.<br>
Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:<br>
And let not Bardolph&#8217;s vital thread be cut<br>
With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:<br>
Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.</p>

<p class="speech">Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to
rejoice
at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.</p>

at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was
shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;
and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,
which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what
a beard of the general&#8217;s cut and a horrid suit of
the camp will do among foaming bottles and
ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or
else you may be marvellously mistook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he
is
not the man that he would gladly make show to the
world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will
tell him my mind.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum heard</span></p>

with
him from the pridge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum and colours. Enter King
Henry, Gloucester, and Soldiers</span></p>
<p class="speech">God pless your majesty!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the
bridge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter
has
very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most
prave passages; marry, th&#8217; athversary was have
possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to
retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a
prave man.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">What men have you lost, Fluellen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">The perdition of th&#8217; athversary hath been
very
great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I
think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that
is like to be executed for robbing a church, one
Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is
all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o&#8217;
fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like
a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;
but his nose is executed and his fire&#8217;s out.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We would have all such offenders so cut off: and
we
give express charge, that in our marches through the
country, there be nothing compelled from the
villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;
for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the
gentler gamester is the soonest winner.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Tucket. Enter
Montjoy</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Montjoy</p>
<p class="speech">You know me by my habit.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Well then I know thee: what shall I know of
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montjoy</p>
<p class="speech">My master&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Unfold it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montjoy</p>
<p class="speech">Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of
England:
Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
therefore consider of his ransom; which must
proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
my king and master; so much my office.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">What is thy name? I know thy quality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montjoy</p>
<p class="speech">Montjoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.<br>
And tell thy king I do not seek him now;<br>
But could be willing to march on to Calais<br>
Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,<br>
Though &#8217;tis no wisdom to confess so much<br>
Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,<br>
My people are with sickness much enfeebled,<br>
My numbers lessened, and those few I have<br>
Almost no better than so many French;<br>
Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,<br>
I thought upon one pair of English legs<br>
Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,<br>
That I do brag thus! This your air of France<br>
Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.<br>
Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;<br>
My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,<br>
My army but a weak and sickly guard;<br>
Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,<br>
Though France himself and such another neighbour<br>
Stand in our way. There&#8217;s for thy labour, Montjoy.<br>
Go bid thy master well advise himself:<br>
If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder&#8217;d,<br>
We shall your tawny ground with your red blood<br>
Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.<br>
The sum of all our answer is but this:<br>
We would not seek a battle, as we are;<br>
Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:<br>
So tell your master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Montjoy</p>
<p class="speech">I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I hope they will not come upon us now.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">We are in God&#8217;s hand, brother, not in
theirs.<br>
March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:<br>
Beyond the river we&#8217;ll encamp ourselves,<br>
And on to-morrow, bid them march away.</p>

<h4>Scene VII. The French camp, near Agincourt:</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Constable of
France, the Lord Rambures, Orleans, Dauphin, with others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would
it were day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">You have an excellent armour; but let my horse
have his due.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">It is the best horse of Europe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Will it never be morning?</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable,
you
talk of horse and armour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">You are as well provided of both as any prince in
the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">What a long night is this! I will not change
my
horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s of the colour of the nutmeg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast
for
Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
may call beasts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and
excellent horse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like
the
bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">No more, cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from
the
rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:
&#8217;tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
a sovereign&#8217;s sovereign to ride on; and for the
world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
their particular functions and wonder at him. I
once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
&#8216;Wonder of nature,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard a sonnet begin so to one&#8217;s
mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Then did they imitate that which I composed to
my
courser, for my horse is my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Your mistress bears well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Me well; which is the prescript praise and
perfection of a good and particular mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress
shrewdly
shook your back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">So perhaps did yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Mine was not bridled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">O then belike she was old and gentle; and you
rode,
like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
your straight strossers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">You have good judgment in horsemanship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and
ride
not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
my horse to my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I had as lief have my mistress a jade.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own
hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a
sow
to my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Le chien est retourne a son propre
vomissement, et
la truie lavee au bourbier;&#8217; thou makest use of any
thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or
any
such proverb so little kin to the purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rambures</p>
<p class="speech">My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your
tent
to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Stars, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">And yet my sky shall not want.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">That may be, for you bear a many superfluously,
and<br>
&#8217;twere more honour some were away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Even as your horse bears your praises; who
would
trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">Would I were able to load him with his desert!
Will
it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
my way shall be paved with English faces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out
of
my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
fain be about the ears of the English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rambures</p>
<p class="speech">Who will go to hazard with me for twenty
prisoners?</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you
have them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dauphin</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis midnight; I&#8217;ll go arm
myself.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">The Dauphin longs for morning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rambures</p>
<p class="speech">He longs to eat the English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I think he will eat all he kills.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">By the white hand of my lady, he&#8217;s a
gallant prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the
oath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">He is simply the most active gentleman of
France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Doing is activity; and he will still be
doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">He never did harm, that I heard of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that
good name still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">I know him to be valiant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I was told that by one that knows him better
than
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he
cared
not who knew it</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw
it
but his lackey: &#8217;tis a hooded valour; and when it
appears, it will bate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Ill will never said well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">I will cap that proverb with &#8216;There is
flattery in friendship.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">And I will take up that with &#8216;Give the

<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Well placed: there stands your friend for the
devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with &#8216;A
pox of the devil.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">You are the better at proverbs, by how much
&#8216;A
fool&#8217;s bolt is soon shot.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">You have shot over.</p>

overshot.</p>

fifteen hundred paces of your tents.</p>

<p class="speech">Who hath measured the ground?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">The Lord Grandpre.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it
were
day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
the dawning as we do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king
of
England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so
far out of his knowledge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">If the English had any apprehension, they would
run away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">That they lack; for if their heads had any
intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy
head-pieces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rambures</p>
<p class="speech">That island of England breeds very valiant
creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of
a
Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
rotten apples! You may as well say, that&#8217;s a
valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Just, just; and the men do sympathize with
the
mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
their wits with their wives: and then give them
great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
eat like wolves and fight like devils.</p>
<p class="speaker">Orleans</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of
beef.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constable</p>
<p class="speech">Then shall we find to-morrow they have only
stomachs
to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
come, shall we about it?</p>

When creeping murmur and the poring dark<br>

From camp to camp through the foul womb of night<br>
The hum of either army stilly sounds,<br>
That the fixed sentinels almost receive<br>
The secret whispers of each other&#8217;s watch:<br>
Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames<br>
Each battle sees the other&#8217;s umber&#8217;d face;<br>
Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs<br>
Piercing the night&#8217;s dull ear, and from the tents<br>

The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,<br>
And the third hour of drowsy morning name.<br>
Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,<br>
The confident and over-lusty French<br>

Bids them good morrow with a modest smile<br>

Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour<br>

A largess universal like the sun<br>
His liberal eye doth give to every one,<br>
Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,<br>
Behold, as may unworthiness define,<br>
A little touch of Harry in the night.<br>

<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It
is
the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
nor pibble pabble in Pompey&#8217;s camp; I warrant you,
you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the
cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety
of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>

night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>

coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gower</p>

<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Though it appear a little out of fashion,<br>
There is much care and valour in this Welshman.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter three soldiers, John
Bates, Alexander Court, and Michael Williams</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Court</p>
<p class="speech">Brother John Bates, is not that the morning
which
breaks yonder?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">I think it be: but we have no great cause to
desire
the approach of day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I
think
we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">A friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Under what captain serve you?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">A good old commander and a most kind gentleman:
I
pray you, what thinks he of our estate?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to
be
washed off the next tide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">He hath not told his thought to the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though
I
speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
it, should dishearten his army.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">He may show what outward courage he will; but
I
believe, as cold a night as &#8217;tis, he could wish
himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the
king:
I think he would not wish himself any where but
where he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">Then I would he were here alone; so should he
be
sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men&#8217;s lives saved.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him
here
alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men&#8217;s
minds: methinks I could not die any where so
contented as in the king&#8217;s company; his cause being
just and his quarrel honourable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s more than we know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we
know
enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
the crime of it out of us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">But if the cause be not good, the king himself
hath
a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
together at the latter day and cry all &#8216;We died at
such a place;&#8217; some swearing, some crying for a
surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
well that die in a battle; for how can they
charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
will be a black matter for the king that led them to
it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
subjection.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">So, if a son that is by his father sent about
merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
servant, under his master&#8217;s command transporting a
sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
business of the master the author of the servant&#8217;s
damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
bound to answer the particular endings of his
soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
so that here men are punished for before-breach of
the king&#8217;s laws in now the king&#8217;s quarrel: where
they feared the death, they have borne life away;
and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
their damnation than he was before guilty of those
impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
subject&#8217;s duty is the king&#8217;s; but every
subject&#8217;s
soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
that, making God so free an offer, He let him
outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
others how they should prepare.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the
ill upon
his own head, the king is not to answer it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">But I do not desire he should answer for me;
and
yet I determine to fight lustily for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I myself heard the king say he would not be
ransomed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully:
but
when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
ne&#8217;er the wiser.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">If I live to see it, I will never trust his word
after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">You pay him then. That&#8217;s a perilous shot
out of an
elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
peacock&#8217;s feather. You&#8217;ll never trust his word
after! come, &#8217;tis a foolish saying.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Your reproof is something too round: I should
be
angry with you, if the time were convenient.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I embrace it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">How shall I know thee again?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in
my
bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
will make it my quarrel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s my glove: give me another of
thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">There.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou
come
to me and say, after to-morrow, &#8216;This is my glove,&#8217;
by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">If ever I live to see it, I will challenge
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Thou darest as well be hanged.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
king&#8217;s company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Williams</p>
<p class="speech">Keep thy word: fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bates</p>
<p class="speech">Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we
have<br>
French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns
to
one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their
shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
be a clipper.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt soldiers</span></p>

The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,<br>
The farced title running &#8217;fore the king,<br>
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp<br>
That beats upon the high shore of this world,<br>
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,<br>
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,<br>
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,<br>
Who with a body fill&#8217;d and vacant mind<br>
Gets him to rest, cramm&#8217;d with distressful bread;<br>
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,<br>
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set<br>
Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night<br>
Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,<br>
Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,<br>
And follows so the ever-running year,<br>
With profitable labour, to his grave:<br>
And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,<br>
Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,<br>
Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.<br>
The slave, a member of the country&#8217;s peace,<br>
Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots<br>

Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.<br>
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?<br>
The man that once did sell the lion&#8217;s skin<br>
While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.<br>
A many of our bodies shall no doubt<br>
Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,<br>
Shall witness live in brass of this day&#8217;s work:<br>
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,<br>
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,<br>
They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,<br>
And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;<br>
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,<br>
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.<br>
Mark then abounding valour in our English,<br>
That being dead, like to the bullet&#8217;s grazing,<br>
Break out into a second course of mischief,<br>
Killing in relapse of mortality.<br>
Let me speak proudly: tell the constable<br>
We are but warriors for the working-day;<br>
Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch&#8217;d<br>
With rainy marching in the painful field;<br>
There&#8217;s not a piece of feather in our host&#8212;<br>
Good argument, I hope, we will not fly&#8212;<br>
And time hath worn us into slovenry:<br>
But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;<br>
And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night<br>
They&#8217;ll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck<br>
The gay new coats o&#8217;er the French soldiers&#8217; heads<br>
And turn them out of service. If they do this,&#8212;<br>
As, if God please, they shall,&#8212;my ransom then<br>
Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;<br>
Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:<br>
They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;<br>
Which if they have as I will leave &#8217;em them,<br>
Shall yield them little, tell the constable.</p>

<p class="speaker">Gower</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis certain there&#8217;s not a boy left
alive; and the
cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha&#8217; done
this slaughter: besides, they have burned and
carried away all that was in the king&#8217;s tent;
wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every
soldier to cut his prisoner&#8217;s throat. O, &#8217;tis a
gallant king!</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower.

his
father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.</p>

<p class="speech">I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn.
I
tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the
&#8217;orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,
look you, is both alike. There is a river in
Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at
Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is
out of my prains what is the name of the other
river; but &#8217;tis all one, &#8217;tis alike as my fingers
is
to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you
mark Alexander&#8217;s life well, Harry of Monmouth&#8217;s
life
is come after it indifferent well; for there is
figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and
you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his
wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and
his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.</p>

killed
any of his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fluellen</p>
<p class="speech">It is not well done, mark you now take the tales
out
of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in
his right wits and his good judgments, turned away
the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he
was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and

For I do know Fluellen valiant<br>

And quickly will return an injury:<br>
Follow and see there be no harm between them.<br>
Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.</p>

Be here presented. Now we bear the king<br>
Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,<br>
Heave him away upon your winged thoughts<br>
Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach<br>
Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,<br>
Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth&#8217;d sea,<br>

Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,<br>

So swift a pace hath thought that even now<br>
You may imagine him upon Blackheath;<br>
Where that his lords desire him to have borne<br>
His bruised helmet and his bended sword<br>
Before him through the city: he forbids it,<br>
Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;<br>
Giving full trophy, signal and ostent<br>
Quite from himself to God. But now behold,<br>
In the quick forge and working-house of thought,<br>
How London doth pour out her citizens!<br>

Were now the general of our gracious empress,<br>
As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,<br>
Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,<br>
How many would the peaceful city quit,<br>
To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,<br>
Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;<br>
As yet the lamentation of the French<br>
Invites the King of England&#8217;s stay at home;<br>
The emperor&#8217;s coming in behalf of France,<br>
To order peace between them; and omit<br>
All the occurrences, whatever chanced,<br>
Till Harry&#8217;s back-return again to France:<br>

Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,<br>

Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?<br>
Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,<br>
And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,<br>
Corrupting in its own fertility.<br>
Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,<br>
Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach&#8217;d,<br>

Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,<br>

Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,<br>
The sciences that should become our country;<br>
But grow like savages,&#8212;as soldiers will<br>

<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">The princess is the better Englishwoman. I&#8217;
faith,
Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if
thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
directly to say &#8216;I love you:&#8217; then if you urge me
farther than to say &#8216;do you in faith?&#8217; I wear out
my suit. Give me your answer; i&#8217; faith, do: and so
clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance
for
your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;
only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the
Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
can rhyme themselves into ladies&#8217; favours, they do
always reason themselves out again. What! a
speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it
shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,
take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of
France?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">No; it is not possible you should love the enemy
of
France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
the friend of France; for I love France so well that
I will not part with a village of it; I will have it
all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
yours, then yours is France and you are mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell vat is dat.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I
am
sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
wife about her husband&#8217;s neck, hardly to be shook
off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand
vous avez le possession de moi,&#8212;let me see, what
then? Saint Denis be my speed!&#8212;donc votre est
France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,
Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
more French: I shall never move thee in French,
unless it be to laugh at me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez,
il
est meilleur que l&#8217;Anglois lequel je parle.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">No, faith, is&#8217;t not, Kate: but thy speaking
of my
tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs
be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou
understand thus much English, canst thou love me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I&#8217;ll
ask
them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,
when you come into your closet, you&#8217;ll question this
gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
rather, gentle princess, because I love thee
cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a
saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get
thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,
between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a
boy, half French, half English, that shall go to
Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair
flower-de-luce?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know dat</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">No; &#8217;tis hereafter to know, but now to
promise: do
but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your
French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety
take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher
et devin deesse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive
de
most sage demoiselle dat is en France.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour,
in
true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I
dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to
flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor
and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew
my father&#8217;s ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
when he got me: therefore was I created with a
stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:
my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:
and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
take me by the hand, and say &#8216;Harry of England I am
thine:&#8217; which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud &#8216;England is
thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry
Plantagenet is thine;&#8217; who though I speak it before
his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,
thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is
music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of
all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken
English; wilt thou have me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall
please
him, Kate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Den it sall also content me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my
queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi,
je
ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
baisant la main d&#8217;une de votre seigeurie indigne
serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon
tres-puissant seigneur.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees
devant
leur noces, il n&#8217;est pas la coutume de France.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Madam my interpreter, what says she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alice</p>
<p class="speech">Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies
of<br>
France,&#8212;I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">To kiss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alice</p>
<p class="speech">Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">It is not a fashion for the maids in France to
kiss
before they are married, would she say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alice</p>
<p class="speech">Oui, vraiment.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings.
Dear
Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
list of a country&#8217;s fashion: we are the makers of
manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our
places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will
do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your
country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently
and yielding.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing her</span></p>
<p class="speech">You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there
is
more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
tongues of the French council; and they should
sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter the French King and
his Queen, Burgundy, and other Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach
you
our princess English?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
perfectly I love her; and that is good English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not apt?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is
not
smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the
heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in
his true likeness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer
you
for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
to consign to.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and
enforces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">They are then excused, my lord, when they see
not
what they do.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent
winking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you
will
teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
summered and warm kept, are like flies at
Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
before would not abide looking on.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">This moral ties me over to time and a hot
summer;
and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
latter end and she must be blind too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Burgundy</p>
<p class="speech">As love is, my lord, before it loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love
for
my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city
for one fair French maid that stands in my way.</p>
<p class="speaker">French King</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the
cities
turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with
maiden walls that war hath never entered.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Shall Kate be my wife?</p>
<p class="speaker">French King</p>
<p class="speech">So please you.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of
may
wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
my wish shall show me the way to my will.</p>
<p class="speaker">French King</p>
<p class="speech">We have consented to all terms of reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t so, my lords of England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Westmoreland</p>
<p class="speech">The king hath granted every article:<br>
His daughter first, and then in sequel all,<br>
According to their firm proposed natures.</p>
<p class="speaker">Exeter</p>
<p class="speech">Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,
having any occasion to write for matter of grant,
shall name your highness in this form and with this
addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi
d&#8217;Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in
Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex
Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.</p>
<p class="speaker">French King</p>
<p class="speech">Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,<br>
But your request shall make me let it pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,<br>
Let that one article rank with the rest;<br>
And thereupon give me your daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">French King</p>
<p class="speech">Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise
up<br>
Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms<br>
Of France and England, whose very shores look pale<br>
With envy of each other&#8217;s happiness,<br>
May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction<br>
Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord<br>
In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance<br>
His bleeding sword &#8217;twixt England and fair France.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry V</p>
<p class="speech">Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,<br>
That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.</p>

<p class="speaker">Queen Isabel</p>
<p class="speech">God, the best maker of all marriages,<br>

As man and wife, being two, are one in love,<br>
So be there &#8217;twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,<br>
That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,<br>
Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,<br>
Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,<br>
To make divorce of their incorporate league;<br>
That English may as French, French Englishmen,<br>
Receive each other. God speak this Amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
