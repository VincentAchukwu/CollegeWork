<h4>Scene I. London. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The trumpets sound. Enter the
young Prince Edward, Gloucester, Buckingham, Cardinal, Catesby, and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your
chamber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts&#8217;
sovereign<br>
The weary way hath made you melancholy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">No, uncle; but our crosses on the way<br>
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy<br>
I want more uncles here to welcome me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your
years<br>
Hath not yet dived into the world&#8217;s deceit<br>
Nor more can you distinguish of a man<br>
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,<br>
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.<br>
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<br>
Your grace attended to their sugar&#8217;d words,<br>
But look&#8217;d not on the poison of their hearts :<br>
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">God keep me from false friends! but they were
none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet
you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Lord Mayor and his
train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">God bless your grace with health and happy
days!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.<br>
I thought my mother, and my brother York,<br>
Would long ere this have met us on the way<br>
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not<br>
To tell us whether they will come or no!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">And, in good time, here comes the sweating
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">On what occasion, God he knows, not I,<br>
The queen your mother, and your brother York,<br>
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince<br>
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,<br>
But by his mother was perforce withheld.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, what an indirect and peevish course<br>
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace<br>
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York<br>
Unto his princely brother presently?<br>
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,<br>
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory<br>
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,<br>
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate<br>
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid<br>
We should infringe the holy privilege<br>
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land<br>
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">You are too senseless&#8212;obstinate, my
lord,<br>
Too ceremonious and traditional<br>
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,<br>
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.<br>
The benefit thereof is always granted<br>
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,<br>
And those who have the wit to claim the place:<br>
This prince hath neither claim&#8217;d it nor deserved it;<br>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:<br>
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,<br>
You break no privilege nor charter there.<br>
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;<br>
But sanctuary children ne&#8217;er till now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you shall o&#8217;er-rule my mind for
once.<br>
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">I go, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Good lords, make all the speedy haste you
may.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Cardinal and
Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speech">Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,<br>
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Where it seems best unto your royal self.<br>
If I may counsel you, some day or two<br>
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:<br>
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit<br>
For your best health and recreation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">I do not like the Tower, of any place.<br>
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;<br>
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Is it upon record, or else reported<br>
Successively from age to age, he built it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Upon record, my gracious lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">But say, my lord, it were not
register&#8217;d,<br>
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,<br>
As &#8217;twere retail&#8217;d to all posterity,<br>
Even to the general all-ending day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> So wise so
young, they say, do never
live long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, uncle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I say, without characters, fame lives long.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,<br>
I moralize two meanings in one word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">That Julius Caesar was a famous man;<br>
With what his valour did enrich his wit,<br>
His wit set down to make his valour live<br>
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;<br>
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">What, my gracious lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">An if I live until I be a man,<br>
I&#8217;ll win our ancient right in France again,<br>
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Short summers
lightly have a forward spring.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter young York, Hastings,
and the Cardinal</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of
York.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Richard of York! how fares our loving
brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:<br>
Too late he died that might have kept that title,<br>
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,<br>
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth<br>
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He hath, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And therefore is he idle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then is he more beholding to you than I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He may command me as my sovereign;<br>
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">A beggar, brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;<br>
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">A greater gift than that I&#8217;ll give my
cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">A greater gift! O, that&#8217;s the sword to
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">A gentle cousin, were it light enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">O, then, I see, you will part but with light
gifts;<br>
In weightier things you&#8217;ll say a beggar nay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It is too heavy for your grace to wear.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What, would you have my weapon, little lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I would, that I might thank you as you call
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">How?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:<br>
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:<br>
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;<br>
Because that I am little, like an ape,<br>
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!<br>
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,<br>
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:<br>
So cunning and so young is wonderful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, will&#8217;t please you pass along?<br>
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham<br>
Will to your mother, to entreat of her<br>
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">My lord protector needs will have it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what should you fear?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, my uncle Clarence&#8217; angry ghost:<br>
My grandam told me he was murdered there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">I fear no uncles dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Nor none that live, I hope.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">An if they live, I hope I need not fear.<br>
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,<br>
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A Sennet. Exeunt all but
Gloucester, Buckingham and Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Think you, my lord, this little prating York<br>
Was not incensed by his subtle mother<br>
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No doubt, no doubt; O, &#8217;tis a parlous
boy;<br>
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable<br>
He is all the mother&#8217;s, from the top to toe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.<br>
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend<br>
As closely to conceal what we impart:<br>
Thou know&#8217;st our reasons urged upon the way;<br>
What think&#8217;st thou? is it not an easy matter<br>
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,<br>
For the instalment of this noble duke<br>
In the seat royal of this famous isle?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">He for his father&#8217;s sake so loves the
prince,<br>
That he will not be won to aught against him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">What think&#8217;st thou, then, of Stanley? what
will he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">He will do all in all as Hastings doth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle
Catesby,<br>
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,<br>
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;<br>
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,<br>
To sit about the coronation.<br>
If thou dost find him tractable to us,<br>
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:<br>
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,<br>
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,<br>
And give us notice of his inclination:<br>
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,<br>
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to Lord William: tell him,
Catesby,<br>
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries<br>
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;<br>
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,<br>
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Good Catesby, go, effect this business
soundly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">My good lords both, with all the heed I may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we
sleep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">You shall, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">At Crosby Place, there shall you find us
both.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we
perceive<br>
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:<br>
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me<br>
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables<br>
Whereof the king my brother stood possess&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll claim that promise at your
grace&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">And look to have it yielded with all
willingness.<br>
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards<br>
We may digest our complots in some form.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Before Lord Hastings&#8217; house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">What, ho! my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Who knocks at
the door?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">A messenger from the Lord Stanley.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">What is&#8217;t o&#8217;clock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Upon the stroke of four.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">So it should seem by that I have to say.<br>
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">And then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">And then he sends you word<br>
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:<br>
Besides, he says there are two councils held;<br>
And that may be determined at the one<br>
Which may make you and him to rue at the other.<br>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship&#8217;s pleasure,<br>
If presently you will take horse with him,<br>
And with all speed post with him toward the north,<br>
To shun the danger that his soul divines.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;<br>
Bid him not fear the separated councils<br>
His honour and myself are at the one,<br>
And at the other is my servant Catesby<br>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us<br>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.<br>
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:<br>
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond<br>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers<br>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,<br>
Were to incense the boar to follow us<br>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<br>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me<br>
And we will both together to the Tower,<br>
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, I&#8217;ll tell him what you
say.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Many good morrows to my noble lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring<br>
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;<br>
And I believe twill never stand upright<br>
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the
crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have this crown of mine cut from my
shoulders<br>
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.<br>
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward<br>
Upon his party for the gain thereof:<br>
And thereupon he sends you this good news,<br>
That this same very day your enemies,<br>
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,<br>
Because they have been still mine enemies:<br>
But, that I&#8217;ll give my voice on Richard&#8217;s side,<br>
To bar my master&#8217;s heirs in true descent,<br>
God knows I will not do it, to the death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month
hence,<br>
That they who brought me in my master&#8217;s hate<br>
I live to look upon their tragedy.<br>
I tell thee, Catesby&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">What, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Ere a fortnight make me elder,<br>
I&#8217;ll send some packing that yet think not on it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious
lord,<br>
When men are unprepared and look not for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out<br>
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so &#8217;twill do<br>
With some men else, who think themselves as safe<br>
As thou and I; who, as thou know&#8217;st, are dear<br>
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">The princes both make high account of you;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">For they account his head upon the bridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">I know they do; and I have well deserved it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Stanley</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear,
man?<br>
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:<br>
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,<br>
I do not like these several councils, I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;<br>
And never in my life, I do protest,<br>
Was it more precious to me than &#8217;tis now:<br>
Think you, but that I know our state secure,<br>
I would be so triumphant as I am?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from
London,<br>
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,<br>
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;<br>
But yet, you see how soon the day o&#8217;ercast.<br>
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:<br>
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!<br>
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my
lord?<br>
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Stanley</p>
<p class="speech">They, for their truth, might better wear their
heads<br>
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.<br>
But come, my lord, let us away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Pursuivant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Go on before; I&#8217;ll talk with this good
fellow.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Stanley and
Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, sirrah! how goes the world with
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pursuivant</p>
<p class="speech">The better that your lordship please to ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, man, &#8217;tis better with me
now<br>
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:<br>
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,<br>
By the suggestion of the queen&#8217;s allies;<br>
But now, I tell thee&#8212;keep it to thyself&#8212;<br>
This day those enemies are put to death,<br>
And I in better state than e&#8217;er I was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pursuivant</p>
<p class="speech">God hold it, to your honour&#8217;s good
content!</p>

So smooth he daub&#8217;d his vice with show of virtue,<br>
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,<br>
I mean, his conversation with Shore&#8217;s wife,<br>

Because, my lord, we would have had you heard<br>
The traitor speak, and timorously confess<br>

Only for saying he would make his son<br>
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,<br>

Moreover, urge his hateful luxury<br>
And bestial appetite in change of lust;<br>
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,<br>
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,<br>
Without control, listed to make his prey.<br>
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:<br>

Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York<br>
My princely father then had wars in France<br>
And, by just computation of the time,<br>
Found that the issue was not his begot;<br>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord: he doth entreat your
grace;<br>
To visit him to-morrow or next day:<br>
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,<br>
Divinely bent to meditation;<br>
And no worldly suit would he be moved,<br>
To draw him from his holy exercise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;<br>
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,<br>
In deep designs and matters of great moment,<br>
No less importing than our general good,<br>
Are come to have some conference with his grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell him what you say, my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an
Edward!<br>
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,<br>
But on his knees at meditation;<br>
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,<br>
But meditating with two deep divines;<br>
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,<br>
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:<br>
Happy were England, would this gracious prince<br>
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:<br>
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne&#8217;er win him to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, God forbid his grace should say us
nay!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">I fear he will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Catesby, what says your lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
He wonders to what end you have assembled<br>
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,<br>
His grace not being warn&#8217;d thereof before:<br>
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Sorry I am my noble cousin should<br>
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:<br>
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;<br>
And so once more return and tell his grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Catesby</span></p>
<p class="speech">When holy and devout religious men<br>
Are at their beads, &#8217;tis hard to draw them thence,<br>
So sweet is zealous contemplation.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester aloft,
between two Bishops. Catesby returns</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">See, where he stands between two clergymen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,<br>
To stay him from the fall of vanity:<br>
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,<br>
True ornaments to know a holy man.<br>
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,<br>
Lend favourable ears to our request;<br>
And pardon us the interruption<br>
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, there needs no such apology:<br>
I rather do beseech you pardon me,<br>
Who, earnest in the service of my God,<br>
Neglect the visitation of my friends.<br>
But, leaving this, what is your grace&#8217;s pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,<br>
And all good men of this ungovern&#8217;d isle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I do suspect I have done some offence<br>
That seems disgracious in the city&#8217;s eyes,<br>
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">You have, my lord: would it might please your
grace,<br>
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Then know, it is your fault that you resign<br>
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,<br>
The scepter&#8217;d office of your ancestors,<br>
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,<br>
The lineal glory of your royal house,<br>
To the corruption of a blemished stock:<br>
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,<br>
Which here we waken to our country&#8217;s good,<br>
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;<br>
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,<br>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,<br>
And almost shoulder&#8217;d in the swallowing gulf<br>
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.<br>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit<br>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge<br>
And kingly government of this your land,<br>
Not as protector, steward, substitute,<br>
Or lowly factor for another&#8217;s gain;<br>
But as successively from blood to blood,<br>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.<br>
For this, consorted with the citizens,<br>
Your very worshipful and loving friends,<br>
And by their vehement instigation,<br>
In this just suit come I to move your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know not whether to depart in silence,<br>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.<br>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition<br>
If not to answer, you might haply think<br>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded<br>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,<br>
Which fondly you would here impose on me;<br>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,<br>
So season&#8217;d with your faithful love to me.<br>
Then, on the other side, I cheque&#8217;d my friends.<br>
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,<br>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,<br>
Definitively thus I answer you.<br>
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert<br>
Unmeritable shuns your high request.<br>
First if all obstacles were cut away,<br>
And that my path were even to the crown,<br>
As my ripe revenue and due by birth<br>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,<br>
So mighty and so many my defects,<br>
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,<br>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,<br>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,<br>
And in the vapour of my glory smother&#8217;d.<br>
But, God be thank&#8217;d, there&#8217;s no need of me,<br>
And much I need to help you, if need were;<br>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,<br>
Which, mellow&#8217;d by the stealing hours of time,<br>
Will well become the seat of majesty,<br>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.<br>
On him I lay what you would lay on me,<br>
The right and fortune of his happy stars;<br>
Which God defend that I should wring from him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, this argues conscience in your
grace;<br>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,<br>
All circumstances well considered.<br>
You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son:<br>
So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife;<br>
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy&#8212;<br>
Your mother lives a witness to that vow&#8212;<br>
And afterward by substitute betroth&#8217;d<br>
To Bona, sister to the King of France.<br>
These both put by a poor petitioner,<br>
A care-crazed mother of a many children,<br>
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,<br>
Even in the afternoon of her best days,<br>
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,<br>
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts<br>
To base declension and loathed bigamy<br>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got<br>
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.<br>
More bitterly could I expostulate,<br>
Save that, for reverence to some alive,<br>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.<br>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<br>
This proffer&#8217;d benefit of dignity;<br>
If non to bless us and the land withal,<br>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry<br>
From the corruption of abusing times,<br>
Unto a lineal true-derived course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer&#8217;d
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?<br>
I am unfit for state and majesty;<br>
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;<br>
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">If you refuse it,&#8212;as, in love and zeal,<br>
Loath to depose the child, Your brother&#8217;s son;<br>
As well we know your tenderness of heart<br>
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,<br>
Which we have noted in you to your kin,<br>
And egally indeed to all estates,&#8212;<br>
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,<br>
Your brother&#8217;s son shall never reign our king;<br>
But we will plant some other in the throne,<br>
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:<br>
And in this resolution here we leave you.&#8212;<br>
Come, citizens: &#8217;zounds! I&#8217;ll entreat no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Buckingham with the
Citizens</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Call them again, my lord, and accept their
suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Another</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Would you enforce me to a world of care?<br>
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,<br>
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,<br>
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Buckingham and the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave
men,<br>
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,<br>
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,<br>
I must have patience to endure the load:<br>
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach<br>
Attend the sequel of your imposition,<br>
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me<br>
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;<br>
For God he knows, and you may partly see,<br>
How far I am from the desire thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">God bless your grace! we see it, and will say
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Then I salute you with this kingly title:<br>
Long live Richard, England&#8217;s royal king!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow will it please you to be
crown&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Even when you please, since you will have it
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:<br>
And so most joyfully we take our leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Come, let us to our holy task again.<br>
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
