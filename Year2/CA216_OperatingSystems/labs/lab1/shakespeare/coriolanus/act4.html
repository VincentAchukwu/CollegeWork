<h4>Scene I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Coriolanus, Volumnia,
Virgilia, Menenius, Cominius, with the young Nobility of
Rome</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the
beast<br>
With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,<br>
Where is your ancient courage? you were used<br>
To say extremity was the trier of spirits;<br>
That common chances common men could bear;<br>
That when the sea was calm all boats alike<br>
Show&#8217;d mastership in floating; fortune&#8217;s blows,<br>
When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves<br>
A noble cunning: you were used to load me<br>
With precepts that would make invincible<br>
The heart that conn&#8217;d them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">O heavens! O heavens!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay! prithee, woman,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Now the red pestilence strike all trades in
Rome,<br>
And occupations perish!</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">What, what, what!<br>
I shall be loved when I am lack&#8217;d. Nay, mother.<br>
Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,<br>
If you had been the wife of Hercules,<br>
Six of his labours you&#8217;ld have done, and saved<br>
Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,<br>
Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:<br>
I&#8217;ll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,<br>
Thy tears are salter than a younger man&#8217;s,<br>
And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,<br>
I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld<br>
Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women<br>
&#8217;Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,<br>
As &#8217;tis to laugh at &#8217;em. My mother, you wot well<br>
My hazards still have been your solace: and<br>
Believe&#8217;t not lightly&#8212;though I go alone,<br>
Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen<br>
Makes fear&#8217;d and talk&#8217;d of more than seen&#8212;your
son<br>
Will or exceed the common or be caught<br>
With cautelous baits and practise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">My first son.<br>
Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius<br>
With thee awhile: determine on some course,<br>
More than a wild exposture to each chance<br>
That starts i&#8217; the way before thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">O the gods!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll follow thee a month, devise with
thee<br>
Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us<br>
And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth<br>
A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send<br>
O&#8217;er the vast world to seek a single man,<br>
And lose advantage, which doth ever cool<br>
I&#8217; the absence of the needer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Fare ye well:<br>
Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full<br>
Of the wars&#8217; surfeits, to go rove with one<br>
That&#8217;s yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.<br>
Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and<br>
My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,<br>
Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.<br>
While I remain above the ground, you shall<br>
Hear from me still, and never of me aught<br>
But what is like me formerly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s worthily<br>
As any ear can hear. Come, let&#8217;s not weep.<br>
If I could shake off but one seven years<br>
From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,<br>
I&#8217;ld with thee every foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand: Come.</p>

an Aedile</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Bid them all home; he&#8217;s gone, and
we&#8217;ll no further.<br>
The nobility are vex&#8217;d, whom we see have sided<br>
In his behalf.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now we have shown our power,<br>
Let us seem humbler after it is done<br>
Than when it was a-doing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Bid them home:<br>
Say their great enemy is gone, and they<br>
Stand in their ancient strength.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Dismiss them home.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Aedile</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes his mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s not meet her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">They say she&#8217;s mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">They have ta&#8217;en note of us: keep on your
way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Volumnia, Virgilia, and
Menenius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">O, ye&#8217;re well met: the hoarded plague
o&#8217; the gods<br>
Requite your love!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, peace; be not so loud.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">If that I could for weeping, you should
hear,&#8212;<br>
Nay, and you shall hear some.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Will you be gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Sicinius]</span> You
shall stay too: I would I had the power<br>
To say so to my husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Are you mankind?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this
fool.<br>
Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship<br>
To banish him that struck more blows for Rome<br>
Than thou hast spoken words?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">O blessed heavens!</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">More noble blows than ever thou wise words;<br>
And for Rome&#8217;s good. I&#8217;ll tell thee what; yet go:<br>
Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son<br>
Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,<br>
His good sword in his hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Virgilia</p>
<p class="speech">What then!<br>
He&#8217;ld make an end of thy posterity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Bastards and all.<br>
Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">I would he had continued to his country<br>
As he began, and not unknit himself<br>
The noble knot he made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I would he had.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;I would he had&#8217;! &#8217;Twas you
incensed the rabble:<br>
Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth<br>
As I can of those mysteries which heaven<br>
Will not have earth to know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, let us go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Now, pray, sir, get you gone:<br>
You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:&#8212;<br>
As far as doth the Capitol exceed<br>
The meanest house in Rome, so far my son&#8212;<br>
This lady&#8217;s husband here, this, do you see&#8212;<br>
Whom you have banish&#8217;d, does exceed you all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, we&#8217;ll leave you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sicinius</p>
<p class="speech">Why stay we to be baited<br>
With one that wants her wits?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Take my prayers with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Tribunes</span></p>
<p class="speech">I would the gods had nothing else to do<br>
But to confirm my curses! Could I meet &#8217;em<br>
But once a-day, it would unclog my heart<br>
Of what lies heavy to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">You have told them home;<br>
And, by my troth, you have cause. You&#8217;ll sup with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volumnia</p>
<p class="speech">Anger&#8217;s my meat; I sup upon myself,<br>
And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let&#8217;s go:<br>
Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,<br>
In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.</p>

<h4>Scene III. A highway between Rome and Antium.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Roman and a Volsce,
meeting</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I know you well, sir, and you know
me: your name, I think, is Adrian.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I am a Roman; and my services are,
as you are, against &#8217;em: know you me yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Nicanor? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The same, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">You had more beard when I last saw you; but
your
favour is well approved by your tongue. What&#8217;s the
news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
to find you out there: you have well saved me a
day&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">There hath been in Rome strange insurrections;
the
people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks
not
so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The main blaze of it is past, but a small
thing
would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
so to heart the banishment of that worthy
Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
all power from the people and to pluck from them
their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
breaking out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">Coriolanus banished!</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">Banished, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">You will be welcome with this intelligence,
Nicanor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">The day serves well for them now. I have heard
it
said, the fittest time to corrupt a man&#8217;s wife is
when she&#8217;s fallen out with her husband. Your noble
Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
of his country.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
business, and I will merrily accompany you home.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I shall, between this and supper, tell you
most
strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">A most royal one; the centurions and their
charges,
distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
and to be on foot at an hour&#8217;s warning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am
the
man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Volsce</p>
<p class="speech">You take my part from me, sir; I have the most
cause
to be glad of yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Roman</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let us go together.</p>

apparel, disguised and muffled</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">A goodly city is this Antium. City,<br>
&#8217;Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir<br>
Of these fair edifices &#8217;fore my wars<br>
Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,<br>
Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones<br>
In puny battle slay me.</p>

<p class="speech">He is, and feasts the nobles of the state<br>
At his house this night.</p>

<p class="speech">O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast
sworn,<br>
Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,<br>
Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,<br>
Are still together, who twin, as &#8217;twere, in love<br>
Unseparable, shall within this hour,<br>
On a dissension of a doit, break out<br>
To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,<br>
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,<br>
To take the one the other, by some chance,<br>
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends<br>
And interjoin their issues. So with me:<br>
My birth-place hate I, and my love&#8217;s upon<br>
This enemy town. I&#8217;ll enter: if he slay me,<br>
He does fair justice; if he give me way,<br>
I&#8217;ll do his country service.</p>

Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may<br>
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,<br>
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood<br>
Shed for my thankless country are requited<br>
But with that surname; a good memory,<br>
And witness of the malice and displeasure<br>
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;<br>
The cruelty and envy of the people,<br>
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who<br>
Have all forsook me, hath devour&#8217;d the rest;<br>
And suffer&#8217;d me by the voice of slaves to be<br>
Whoop&#8217;d out of Rome. Now this extremity<br>
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope&#8212;<br>
Mistake me not&#8212;to save my life, for if<br>
I had fear&#8217;d death, of all the men i&#8217; the world<br>
I would have &#8217;voided thee, but in mere spite,<br>
To be full quit of those my banishers,<br>
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast<br>
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge<br>
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims<br>
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,<br>
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it<br>
That my revengeful services may prove<br>
As benefits to thee, for I will fight<br>
Against my canker&#8217;d country with the spleen<br>
Of all the under fiends. But if so be<br>
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes<br>
Thou&#8217;rt tired, then, in a word, I also am<br>
Longer to live most weary, and present<br>
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;<br>
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,<br>
Since I have ever follow&#8217;d thee with hate,<br>
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country&#8217;s breast,<br>
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless<br>
It be to do thee service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">O Marcius, Marcius!<br>
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart<br>
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter<br>
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,<br>
And say &#8217;Tis true,&#8217; I&#8217;ld not believe them
more<br>
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine<br>
Mine arms about that body, where against<br>
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke<br>
And scarr&#8217;d the moon with splinters: here I clip<br>
The anvil of my sword, and do contest<br>
As hotly and as nobly with thy love<br>
As ever in ambitious strength I did<br>
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,<br>
I loved the maid I married; never man<br>
Sigh&#8217;d truer breath; but that I see thee here,<br>
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart<br>
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw<br>
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,<br>
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose<br>
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,<br>
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out<br>
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since<br>
Dreamt of encounters &#8217;twixt thyself and me;<br>
We have been down together in my sleep,<br>
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other&#8217;s throat,<br>
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,<br>
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that<br>
Thou art thence banish&#8217;d, we would muster all<br>
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war<br>
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,<br>
Like a bold flood o&#8217;er-bear. O, come, go in,<br>
And take our friendly senators by the hands;<br>
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,<br>
Who am prepared against your territories,<br>
Though not for Rome itself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Coriolanus</p>
<p class="speech">You bless me, gods!</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt
have<br>
The leading of thine own revenges, take<br>
The one half of my commission; and set down&#8212;<br>
As best thou art experienced, since thou know&#8217;st<br>
Thy country&#8217;s strength and weakness,&#8212;thine own
ways;<br>
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,<br>
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,<br>
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:<br>
Let me commend thee first to those that shall<br>
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!<br>
And more a friend than e&#8217;er an enemy;<br>
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Coriolanus and
Aufidius. The two Servingmen come forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s a strange alteration!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him
with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">What an arm he has! he turned me about with
his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I knew by his face that there was something
in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,&#8212;I
cannot tell how to term it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">He had so; looking as it were&#8212;would I were
hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">So did I, I&#8217;ll be sworn: he is simply the
rarest
man i&#8217; the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you
wot on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Who, my master?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, it&#8217;s no matter for that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Worth six on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say
that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and for an assault too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter third
Servingman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">O slaves, I can tell you news,&#8212; news, you
rascals!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">What, what, what? let&#8217;s partake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had
as
lieve be a condemned man.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore? wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, here&#8217;s he that was wont to thwack our
general,<br>
Caius Marcius.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you say &#8217;thwack our general
&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">I do not say &#8217;thwack our general;&#8217;
but he was always
good enough for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever
too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">He was too hard for him directly, to say the
troth
on&#8217;t: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">An he had been cannibally given, he might
have
broiled and eaten him too.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But, more of thy news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were
son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o&#8217; the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with&#8217;s hand and
turns up the white o&#8217; the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i&#8217;
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He&#8217;ll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">And he&#8217;s as like to do&#8217;t as any man I
can imagine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Do&#8217;t! he will do&#8217;t; for, look you,
sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he&#8217;s in directitude.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Directitude! what&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But when they shall see, sir, his crest up
again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">But when goes this forward?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have
the
drum struck up this afternoon: &#8217;tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then we shall have a stirring world
again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far
as
day does night; it&#8217;s spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war&#8217;s a destroyer of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be
said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and it makes men hate one another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Servingman</p>
<p class="speech">Reason; because they then less need one
another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>

We have record that very well it can,<br>
And three examples of the like have been<br>
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,<br>

How probable I do not know&#8212;that Marcius,<br>

And vows revenge as spacious as between<br>
The young&#8217;st and oldest thing.</p>

Or butchers killing flies.</p>

<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and you&#8217;ll look pale<br>
Before you find it other. All the regions<br>
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist<br>
Are mock&#8217;d for valiant ignorance,<br>
And perish constant fools. Who is&#8217;t can blame him?<br>
Your enemies and his find something in him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">We are all undone, unless<br>
The noble man have mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cominius</p>
<p class="speech">Who shall ask it?<br>
The tribunes cannot do&#8217;t for shame; the people<br>
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf<br>
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they<br>
Should say &#8216;Be good to Rome,&#8217; they charged him even<br>
As those should do that had deserved his hate,<br>
And therein show&#8217;d like enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Menenius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true:<br>
If he were putting to my house the brand<br>
That should consume it, I have not the face<br>
To say &#8216;Beseech you, cease.&#8217; You have made fair
hands,<br>

Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at<br>
Coriolanus&#8217; exile. Now he&#8217;s coming;<br>
And not a hair upon a soldier&#8217;s head<br>
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs<br>
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,<br>
And pay you for your voices. &#8217;Tis no matter;<br>
If he could burn us all into one coal,<br>
We have deserved it.</p>

<h4>Scene VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aufidius and his
Lieutenant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">Do they still fly to the Roman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="speech">I do not know what witchcraft&#8217;s in him,
but<br>
Your soldiers use him as the grace &#8217;fore meat,<br>
Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;<br>
And you are darken&#8217;d in this action, sir,<br>
Even by your own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I cannot help it now,<br>
Unless, by using means, I lame the foot<br>
Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,<br>
Even to my person, than I thought he would<br>
When first I did embrace him: yet his nature<br>
In that&#8217;s no changeling; and I must excuse<br>
What cannot be amended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="speech">Yet I wish, sir,&#8212;<br>
I mean for your particular,&#8212;you had not<br>
Join&#8217;d in commission with him; but either<br>
Had borne the action of yourself, or else<br>
To him had left it solely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">I understand thee well; and be thou sure,<br>
When he shall come to his account, he knows not<br>
What I can urge against him. Although it seems,<br>
And so he thinks, and is no less apparent<br>
To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.<br>
And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,<br>
Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon<br>
As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone<br>
That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,<br>
Whene&#8217;er we come to our account.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lieutenant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I beseech you, think you he&#8217;ll carry
Rome?</p>
<p class="speaker">Aufidius</p>
<p class="speech">All places yield to him ere he sits down;<br>
And the nobility of Rome are his:<br>
The senators and patricians love him too:<br>
The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people<br>
Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty<br>
To expel him thence. I think he&#8217;ll be to Rome<br>
As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it<br>
By sovereignty of nature. First he was<br>
A noble servant to them; but he could not<br>
Carry his honours even: whether &#8217;twas pride,<br>
Which out of daily fortune ever taints<br>
The happy man; whether defect of judgment,<br>
To fail in the disposing of those chances<br>
Which he was lord of; or whether nature,<br>
Not to be other than one thing, not moving<br>
From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace<br>
Even with the same austerity and garb<br>
As he controll&#8217;d the war; but one of these&#8212;<br>
As he hath spices of them all, not all,<br>
For I dare so far free him&#8212;made him fear&#8217;d,<br>
So hated, and so banish&#8217;d: but he has a merit,<br>
To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues<br>
Lie in the interpretation of the time:<br>
And power, unto itself most commendable,<br>
Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair<br>
To extol what it hath done.<br>
One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;<br>
Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.<br>
Come, let&#8217;s away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,<br>
Thou art poor&#8217;st of all; then shortly art thou mine.</p>
