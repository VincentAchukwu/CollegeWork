<h4>Scene I. Petruchio&#8217;s country house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Grumio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters,
and
all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
considering the weather, a taller man than I will
take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Curtis</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Who is that calls so coldly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst
slide
from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire;
cast
on no water.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Is she so hot a shrew as she&#8217;s
reported?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but,
thou
knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
myself, fellow Curtis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot;
and
so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the
world?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine;
and
therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s fire ready; and therefore, good
Grumio, the news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, &#8216;Jack, boy! ho! boy!&#8217; and as
much news as
will thaw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Come, you are so full of cony-catching!</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme
cold.
Where&#8217;s the cook? is supper ready, the house
trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
serving-men in their new fustian, their white
stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
the carpets laid, and every thing in order?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
mistress fallen out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">How?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Out of their saddles into the dirt; and
thereby
hangs a tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s ha&#8217;t, good Grumio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Lend thine ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">There.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">And therefore &#8217;tis called a sensible tale:
and this
cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Both of one horse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that to thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Why, a horse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed
me,
thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
unexperienced to thy grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all
shall
find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
of my master&#8217;s horse-tail till they kiss their
hands. Are they all ready?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">They are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Call them forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
countenance my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she hath a face of her own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">Who knows not that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
countenance her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">I call them forth to credit her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter four or five
Serving-men</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome home, Grumio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Philip</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Grumio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Joseph</p>
<p class="speech">What, Grumio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nicholas</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow Grumio!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">How now, old lad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, you;&#8212;how now, you;&#8212; what,
you;&#8212;fellow,
you;&#8212;and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
companions, is all ready, and all things neat?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">All things is ready. How near is our master?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en at hand, alighted by this; and
therefore be
not&#8212;Cock&#8217;s passion, silence! I hear my master.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Petruchio and
Katharina</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Where be these knaves? What, no man at door<br>
To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!<br>
Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?<br>
All Serving-Men Here, here, sir; here, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!<br>
You logger-headed and unpolish&#8217;d grooms!<br>
What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?<br>
Where is the foolish knave I sent before?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse
drudge!<br>
Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,<br>
And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Nathaniel&#8217;s coat, sir, was not fully
made,<br>
And Gabriel&#8217;s pumps were all unpink&#8217;d i&#8217; the
heel;<br>
There was no link to colour Peter&#8217;s hat,<br>
And Walter&#8217;s dagger was not come from sheathing:<br>
There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;<br>
The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;<br>
Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Servants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Singing</span></p>
<p class="speech">Where is the life that late I led&#8212;<br>
Where are those&#8212;Sit down, Kate, and welcome.&#8212;<br>
Sound, sound, sound, sound!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Servants with
supper</span></p>
<p class="speech">Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be
merry.<br>
Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Sings</span></p>
<p class="speech">It was the friar of orders grey,<br>
As he forth walked on his way:&#8212;<br>
Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:<br>
Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!<br>
Where&#8217;s my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,<br>
And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:<br>
One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.<br>
Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter one with
water</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.<br>
You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Strikes him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, I pray you; &#8217;twas a fault
unwilling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear&#8217;d
knave!<br>
Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.<br>
Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?<br>
What&#8217;s this? mutton?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Who brought it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.<br>
What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?<br>
How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,<br>
And serve it thus to me that love it not?<br>
Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throws the meat, &amp; c.
about the stage</span></p>
<p class="speech">You heedless joltheads and unmanner&#8217;d
slaves!<br>
What, do you grumble? I&#8217;ll be with you straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:<br>
The meat was well, if you were so contented.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, Kate, &#8217;twas burnt and dried
away;<br>
And I expressly am forbid to touch it,<br>
For it engenders choler, planteth anger;<br>
And better &#8217;twere that both of us did fast,<br>
Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,<br>
Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.<br>
Be patient; to-morrow &#8217;t shall be mended,<br>
And, for this night, we&#8217;ll fast for company:<br>
Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Servants
severally</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nathaniel</p>
<p class="speech">Peter, didst ever see the like?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">He kills her in her own humour.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Curtis</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Grumio</p>
<p class="speech">Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curtis</p>
<p class="speech">In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to
her;<br>
And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,<br>
Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,<br>
And sits as one new-risen from a dream.<br>
Away, away! for he is coming hither.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Petruchio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Thus have I politicly begun my reign,<br>
And &#8217;tis my hope to end successfully.<br>
My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;<br>
And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,<br>
For then she never looks upon her lure.<br>
Another way I have to man my haggard,<br>
To make her come and know her keeper&#8217;s call,<br>
That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites<br>
That bate and beat and will not be obedient.<br>
She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;<br>
Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;<br>
As with the meat, some undeserved fault<br>
I&#8217;ll find about the making of the bed;<br>
And here I&#8217;ll fling the pillow, there the bolster,<br>
This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:<br>
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend<br>
That all is done in reverend care of her;<br>
And in conclusion she shall watch all night:<br>
And if she chance to nod I&#8217;ll rail and brawl<br>
And with the clamour keep her still awake.<br>
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;<br>
And thus I&#8217;ll curb her mad and headstrong humour.<br>
He that knows better how to tame a shrew,<br>
Now let him speak: &#8217;tis charity to show.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Padua. Before Baptista&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tranio and
Hortensio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible, friend Licio, that Mistress
Bianca<br>
Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?<br>
I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,<br>
Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bianca and
Lucentio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">What, master, read you? first resolve me
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">I read that I profess, the Art to Love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">And may you prove, sir, master of your art!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my
heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I
pray,<br>
You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca<br>
Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!<br>
I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Mistake no more: I am not Licio,<br>
Nor a musician, as I seem to be;<br>
But one that scorn to live in this disguise,<br>
For such a one as leaves a gentleman,<br>
And makes a god of such a cullion:<br>
Know, sir, that I am call&#8217;d Hortensio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Hortensio, I have often heard<br>
Of your entire affection to Bianca;<br>
And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,<br>
I will with you, if you be so contented,<br>
Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">See, how they kiss and court! Signior
Lucentio,<br>
Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow<br>
Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,<br>
As one unworthy all the former favours<br>
That I have fondly flatter&#8217;d her withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">And here I take the unfeigned oath,<br>
Never to marry with her though she would entreat:<br>
Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Would all the world but he had quite
forsworn!<br>
For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,<br>
I will be married to a wealthy widow,<br>
Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me<br>
As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.<br>
And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.<br>
Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,<br>
Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,<br>
In resolution as I swore before.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace<br>
As &#8217;longeth to a lover&#8217;s blessed case!<br>
Nay, I have ta&#8217;en you napping, gentle love,<br>
And have forsworn you with Hortensio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn
me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>

<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; faith, he&#8217;ll have a lusty widow
now,<br>
That shall be wood and wedded in a day.</p>

<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and he&#8217;ll tame her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">He says so, Tranio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bianca</p>
<p class="speech">The taming-school! what, is there such a
place?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;<br>
That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,<br>
To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.</p>

<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">O master, master, I have watch&#8217;d so
long<br>
That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied<br>
An ancient angel coming down the hill,<br>
Will serve the turn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">What is he, Biondello?</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech">Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,<br>
I know not what; but format in apparel,<br>
In gait and countenance surely like a father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucentio</p>
<p class="speech">And what of him, Tranio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">If he be credulous and trust my tale,<br>
I&#8217;ll make him glad to seem Vincentio,<br>
And give assurance to Baptista Minola,<br>
As if he were the right Vincentio<br>
Take in your love, and then let me alone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucentio and
Bianca</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And you, sir! you are welcome.<br>
Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:<br>
But then up farther, and as for as Rome;<br>
And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">What countryman, I pray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Of Mantua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!<br>
And come to Padua, careless of your life?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes
hard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis death for any one in Mantua<br>
To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?<br>
Your ships are stay&#8217;d at Venice, and the duke,<br>
For private quarrel &#8217;twixt your duke and him,<br>
Hath publish&#8217;d and proclaim&#8217;d it openly:<br>
&#8217;Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,<br>
You might have heard it else proclaim&#8217;d about.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;<br>
For I have bills for money by exchange<br>
From Florence and must here deliver them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, to do you courtesy,<br>
This will I do, and this I will advise you:<br>
First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,<br>
Pisa renowned for grave citizens.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">Among them know you one Vincentio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Pedant</p>
<p class="speech">I know him not, but I have heard of him;<br>
A merchant of incomparable wealth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>
<p class="speech">He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,<br>
In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Biondello</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> As much as an
apple doth an oyster,

If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:<br>
But I, who never knew how to entreat,<br>
Nor never needed that I should entreat,<br>
Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,<br>
With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:<br>
And that which spites me more than all these wants,<br>
He does it under name of perfect love;<br>
As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,<br>

Your betters have endured me say my mind,<br>

My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,<br>

And rather than it shall, I will be free<br>
Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.</p>

Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua<br>
To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio<br>

Of love between your daughter and himself:<br>
And, for the good report I hear of you<br>
And for the love he beareth to your daughter<br>
And she to him, to stay him not too long,<br>
I am content, in a good father&#8217;s care,<br>

No worse than I, upon some agreement<br>
Me shall you find ready and willing<br>

Your plainness and your shortness please me well.<br>
Right true it is, your son Lucentio here<br>
Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,<br>
Or both dissemble deeply their affections:<br>
And therefore, if you say no more than this,<br>
That like a father you will deal with him<br>
And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,<br>
The match is made, and all is done:<br>
Your son shall have my daughter with consent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tranio</p>

counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,

church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for

<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I say it is the moon that shines so bright.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I know it is the sun that shines so bright.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my mother&#8217;s son, and that&#8217;s
myself,<br>
It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,<br>
Or ere I journey to your father&#8217;s house.<br>
Go on, and fetch our horses back again.<br>
Evermore cross&#8217;d and cross&#8217;d; nothing but
cross&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Say as he says, or we shall never go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,<br>
And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:<br>
An if you please to call it a rush-candle,<br>
Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">I say it is the moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">I know it is the moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Then, God be bless&#8217;d, it is the blessed
sun:<br>
But sun it is not, when you say it is not;<br>
And the moon changes even as your mind.<br>
What you will have it named, even that it is;<br>
And so it shall be so for Katharina.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should
run,<br>
And not unluckily against the bias.<br>
But, soft! company is coming here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Vincentio</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Vincentio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?<br>
Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,<br>
Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?<br>
Such war of white and red within her cheeks!<br>
What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,<br>
As those two eyes become that heavenly face?<br>
Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.<br>
Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">A&#8217; will make the man mad, to make a woman
of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and
sweet,<br>
Whither away, or where is thy abode?<br>
Happy the parents of so fair a child;<br>
Happier the man, whom favourable stars<br>
Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:<br>
This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither&#8217;d,<br>
And not a maiden, as thou say&#8217;st he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Katharina</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,<br>
That have been so bedazzled with the sun<br>
That everything I look on seemeth green:<br>
Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;<br>
Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known<br>
Which way thou travellest: if along with us,<br>
We shall be joyful of thy company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,<br>
That with your strange encounter much amazed me,<br>
My name is call&#8217;d Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;<br>
And bound I am to Padua; there to visit<br>
A son of mine, which long I have not seen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">What is his name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Lucentio, gentle sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Happily we met; the happier for thy son.<br>
And now by law, as well as reverend age,<br>
I may entitle thee my loving father:<br>
The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,<br>
Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,<br>
Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,<br>
Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;<br>
Beside, so qualified as may beseem<br>
The spouse of any noble gentleman.<br>
Let me embrace with old Vincentio,<br>
And wander we to see thy honest son,<br>
Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Vincentio</p>
<p class="speech">But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,<br>
Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest<br>
Upon the company you overtake?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">I do assure thee, father, so it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Petruchio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;<br>
For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Hortensio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hortensio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.<br>
Have to my widow! and if she be froward,<br>
Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
