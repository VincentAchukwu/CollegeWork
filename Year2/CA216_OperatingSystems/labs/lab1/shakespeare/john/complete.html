<h4>Scene I. King John&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King John, Queen
Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury, and others, with
Chatillon</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with
us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of
France<br>
In my behavior to the majesty,<br>
The borrow&#8217;d majesty, of England here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">A strange beginning: &#8216;borrow&#8217;d
majesty!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Philip of France, in right and true behalf<br>
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey&#8217;s son,<br>
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim<br>
To this fair island and the territories,<br>
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,<br>
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword<br>
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,<br>
And put these same into young Arthur&#8217;s hand,<br>
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What follows if we disallow of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">The proud control of fierce and bloody war,<br>
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Here have we war for war and blood for blood,<br>
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Then take my king&#8217;s defiance from my
mouth,<br>
The farthest limit of my embassy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:<br>
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;<br>
For ere thou canst report I will be there,<br>
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:<br>
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath<br>
And sullen presage of your own decay.<br>
An honourable conduct let him have:<br>
Pembroke, look to &#8217;t. Farewell, Chatillon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Chatillon and
Pembroke</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">What now, my son! have I not ever said<br>
How that ambitious Constance would not cease<br>
Till she had kindled France and all the world,<br>
Upon the right and party of her son?<br>
This might have been prevented and made whole<br>
With very easy arguments of love,<br>
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must<br>
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Our strong possession and our right for us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Your strong possession much more than your
right,<br>
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:<br>
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,<br>
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Sheriff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Essex</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, here is the strangest controversy<br>
Come from country to be judged by you,<br>
That e&#8217;er I heard: shall I produce the men?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Let them approach.<br>
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay<br>
This expedition&#8217;s charge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Robert and the
Bastard</span></p>
<p class="speech">What men are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Your faithful subject I, a gentleman<br>
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,<br>
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,<br>
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand<br>
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?<br>
You came not of one mother then, it seems.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Most certain of one mother, mighty king;<br>
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:<br>
But for the certain knowledge of that truth<br>
I put you o&#8217;er to heaven and to my mother:<br>
Of that I doubt, as all men&#8217;s children may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy
mother<br>
And wound her honour with this diffidence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;<br>
That is my brother&#8217;s plea and none of mine;<br>
The which if he can prove, a&#8217; pops me out<br>
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:<br>
Heaven guard my mother&#8217;s honour and my land!</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,<br>
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">I know not why, except to get the land.<br>
But once he slander&#8217;d me with bastardy:<br>
But whether I be as true begot or no,<br>
That still I lay upon my mother&#8217;s head,<br>
But that I am as well begot, my liege,&#8212;<br>
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!&#8212;<br>
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.<br>
If old sir Robert did beget us both<br>
And were our father and this son like him,<br>
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee<br>
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion&#8217;s
face;<br>
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.<br>
Do you not read some tokens of my son<br>
In the large composition of this man?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eye hath well examined his parts<br>
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,<br>
What doth move you to claim your brother&#8217;s land?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Because he hath a half-face, like my father.<br>
With half that face would he have all my land:<br>
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious liege, when that my father lived,<br>
Your brother did employ my father much,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:<br>
Your tale must be how he employ&#8217;d my mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">And once dispatch&#8217;d him in an embassy<br>
To Germany, there with the emperor<br>
To treat of high affairs touching that time.<br>
The advantage of his absence took the king<br>
And in the mean time sojourn&#8217;d at my father&#8217;s;<br>
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,<br>
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores<br>
Between my father and my mother lay,<br>
As I have heard my father speak himself,<br>
When this same lusty gentleman was got.<br>
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath&#8217;d<br>
His lands to me, and took it on his death<br>
That this my mother&#8217;s son was none of his;<br>
And if he were, he came into the world<br>
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.<br>
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,<br>
My father&#8217;s land, as was my father&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;<br>
Your father&#8217;s wife did after wedlock bear him,<br>
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;<br>
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands<br>
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,<br>
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,<br>
Had of your father claim&#8217;d this son for his?<br>
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept<br>
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;<br>
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother&#8217;s,<br>
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,<br>
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;<br>
My mother&#8217;s son did get your father&#8217;s heir;<br>
Your father&#8217;s heir must have your father&#8217;s land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">Shall then my father&#8217;s will be of no
force<br>
To dispossess that child which is not his?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,<br>
Than was his will to get me, as I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge<br>
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,<br>
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,<br>
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, an if my brother had my shape,<br>
And I had his, sir Robert&#8217;s his, like him;<br>
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,<br>
My arms such eel-skins stuff&#8217;d, my face so thin<br>
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose<br>
Lest men should say &#8216;Look, where three-farthings
goes!&#8217;<br>
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,<br>
Would I might never stir from off this place,<br>
I would give it every foot to have this face;<br>
I would not be sir Nob in any case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy
fortune,<br>
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?<br>
I am a soldier and now bound to France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, take you my land, I&#8217;ll take my
chance.<br>
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,<br>
Yet sell your face for five pence and &#8217;tis dear.<br>
Madam, I&#8217;ll follow you unto the death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Our country manners give our betters way.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What is thy name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,<br>
Philip, good old sir Robert&#8217;s wife&#8217;s eldest son.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">From henceforth bear his name whose form thou
bear&#8217;st:<br>
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,<br>
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother by the mother&#8217;s side, give me your
hand:<br>
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.<br>
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,<br>
When I was got, sir Robert was away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">The very spirit of Plantagenet!<br>
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, by chance but not by truth; what
though?<br>
Something about, a little from the right,<br>
In at the window, or else o&#8217;er the hatch:<br>
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,<br>
And have is have, however men do catch:<br>
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,<br>
And I am I, howe&#8217;er I was begot.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;<br>
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.<br>
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed<br>
For France, for France, for it is more than need.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!<br>
For thou wast got i&#8217; the way of honesty.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Bastard</span></p>
<p class="speech">A foot of honour better than I was;<br>
But many a many foot of land the worse.<br>
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.<br>
&#8216;Good den, sir Richard!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;God-a-mercy,
fellow!&#8217;&#8212;<br>
And if his name be George, I&#8217;ll call him Peter;<br>
For new-made honour doth forget men&#8217;s names;<br>
&#8217;Tis too respective and too sociable<br>
For your conversion. Now your traveller,<br>
He and his toothpick at my worship&#8217;s mess,<br>
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,<br>
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise<br>
My picked man of countries: &#8216;My dear sir,&#8217;<br>
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,<br>
&#8216;I shall beseech you&#8217;&#8212;that is question now;<br>
And then comes answer like an Absey book:<br>
&#8216;O sir,&#8217; says answer, &#8216;at your best command;<br>
At your employment; at your service, sir;&#8217;<br>
&#8216;No, sir,&#8217; says question, &#8216;I, sweet sir, at
yours:&#8217;<br>
And so, ere answer knows what question would,<br>
Saving in dialogue of compliment,<br>
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,<br>
The Pyrenean and the river Po,<br>
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.<br>
But this is worshipful society<br>
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,<br>
For he is but a bastard to the time<br>
That doth not smack of observation;<br>
And so am I, whether I smack or no;<br>
And not alone in habit and device,<br>
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,<br>
But from the inward motion to deliver<br>
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age&#8217;s tooth:<br>
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,<br>
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;<br>
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.<br>
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?<br>
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband<br>
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lady Faulconbridge and
Gurney</span></p>
<p class="speech">O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!<br>
What brings you here to court so hastily?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Where is that slave, thy brother? where is
he,<br>
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">My brother Robert? old sir Robert&#8217;s
son?<br>
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?<br>
Is it sir Robert&#8217;s son that you seek so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Robert&#8217;s son! Ay, thou unreverend
boy,<br>
Sir Robert&#8217;s son: why scorn&#8217;st thou at sir Robert?<br>
He is sir Robert&#8217;s son, and so art thou.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gurney</p>
<p class="speech">Good leave, good Philip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Philip! sparrow: James,<br>
There&#8217;s toys abroad: anon I&#8217;ll tell thee more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Gurney</span></p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was not old sir Robert&#8217;s son:<br>
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me<br>
Upon Good-Friday and ne&#8217;er broke his fast:<br>
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,<br>
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:<br>
We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,<br>
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?<br>
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,<br>
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?<br>
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.<br>
What! I am dubb&#8217;d! I have it on my shoulder.<br>
But, mother, I am not sir Robert&#8217;s son;<br>
I have disclaim&#8217;d sir Robert and my land;<br>
Legitimation, name and all is gone:<br>
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;<br>
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">As faithfully as I deny the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:<br>
By long and vehement suit I was seduced<br>
To make room for him in my husband&#8217;s bed:<br>
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!<br>
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,<br>
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by this light, were I to get again,<br>
Madam, I would not wish a better father.<br>
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,<br>
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:<br>
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,<br>
Subjected tribute to commanding love,<br>
Against whose fury and unmatched force<br>
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,<br>
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard&#8217;s hand.<br>
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts<br>
May easily win a woman&#8217;s. Ay, my mother,<br>
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!<br>
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well<br>
When I was got, I&#8217;ll send his soul to hell.<br>
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;<br>
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,<br>
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:<br>
Who says it was, he lies; I say &#8217;twas not.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.<br>
Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,<br>
Richard, that robb&#8217;d the lion of his heart<br>
And fought the holy wars in Palestine,<br>
By this brave duke came early to his grave:<br>
And for amends to his posterity,<br>
At our importance hither is he come,<br>
To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,<br>
And to rebuke the usurpation<br>
Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:<br>
Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion&#8217;s
death<br>
The rather that you give his offspring life,<br>
Shadowing their right under your wings of war:<br>
I give you welcome with a powerless hand,<br>
But with a heart full of unstained love:<br>
Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?</p>
<p class="speaker">Austria</p>
<p class="speech">Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,<br>
As seal to this indenture of my love,<br>
That to my home I will no more return,<br>
Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,<br>
Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,<br>
Whose foot spurns back the ocean&#8217;s roaring tides<br>
And coops from other lands her islanders,<br>
Even till that England, hedged in with the main,<br>
That water-walled bulwark, still secure<br>
And confident from foreign purposes,<br>
Even till that utmost corner of the west<br>
Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,<br>
Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constance</p>
<p class="speech">O, take his mother&#8217;s thanks, a

To make a more requital to your love!</p>
<p class="speaker">Austria</p>

In such a just and charitable war.</p>

<p class="speech">Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent<br>
Against the brows of this resisting town.<br>
Call for our chiefest men of discipline,<br>
To cull the plots of best advantages:<br>
We&#8217;ll lay before this town our royal bones,<br>
Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen&#8217;s blood,<br>
But we will make it subject to this boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Constance</p>
<p class="speech">Stay for an answer to your embassy,<br>
Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:<br>
My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,<br>
That right in peace which here we urge in war,<br>
And then we shall repent each drop of blood<br>
That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.</p>

What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;<br>
We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Then turn your forces from this paltry siege<br>
And stir them up against a mightier task.<br>
England, impatient of your just demands,<br>
Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,<br>
Whose leisure I have stay&#8217;d, have given him time<br>
To land his legions all as soon as I;<br>
His marches are expedient to this town,<br>
His forces strong, his soldiers confident.<br>
With him along is come the mother-queen,<br>
An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;<br>
With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;<br>
With them a bastard of the king&#8217;s deceased,<br>
And all the unsettled humours of the land,<br>
Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,<br>
With ladies&#8217; faces and fierce dragons&#8217; spleens,<br>
Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,<br>
Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,<br>
To make hazard of new fortunes here:<br>
In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits<br>
Than now the English bottoms have waft o&#8217;er<br>
Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,<br>
To do offence and scath in Christendom.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum beats</span></p>

For courage mounteth with occasion:<br>
Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.</p>

<p class="speaker">King John</p>

Our just and lineal entrance to our own;<br>
If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,<br>

Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.</p>

England we love; and for that England&#8217;s sake<br>
With burden of our armour here we sweat.<br>
This toil of ours should be a work of thine;<br>
But thou from loving England art so far,<br>
That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king<br>
Cut off the sequence of posterity,<br>
Out-faced infant state and done a rape<br>
Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.<br>
Look here upon thy brother Geffrey&#8217;s face;<br>
These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:<br>
This little abstract doth contain that large<br>
Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time<br>
Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.<br>
That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,<br>
And this his son; England was Geffrey&#8217;s right<br>
And this is Geffrey&#8217;s: in the name of God<br>
How comes it then that thou art call&#8217;d a king,<br>
When living blood doth in these temples beat,<br>
Which owe the crown that thou o&#8217;ermasterest?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">From whom hast thou this great commission,
France,<br>
To draw my answer from thy articles?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">From that supernal judge, that stirs good
thoughts<br>
In any breast of strong authority,<br>
To look into the blots and stains of right:<br>
That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:<br>
Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong<br>
And by whose help I mean to chastise it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, thou dost usurp authority.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>

<p class="speaker">Constance</p>
<p class="speech">Let me make answer; thy usurping son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,<br>
That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!</p>
<p class="speaker">Constance</p>
<p class="speech">My bed was ever to thy son as true<br>
As thine was to thy husband; and this boy<br>
Liker in feature to his father Geffrey<br>
Than thou and John in manners; being as like<br>
As rain to water, or devil to his dam.<br>
My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think<br>
His father never was so true begot:<br>
It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>

You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,<br>
Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;<br>
I&#8217;ll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;<br>
Sirrah, look to&#8217;t; i&#8217; faith, I will, i&#8217;

As great Alcides&#8217; shows upon an ass:<br>
But, ass, I&#8217;ll take that burthen from your back,<br>
Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.</p>

<p class="speech">Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">Women and fools, break off your conference.<br>
King John, this is the very sum of all;<br>
England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,<br>
In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:<br>
Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.<br>
Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;<br>
And out of my dear love I&#8217;ll give thee more<br>

<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>

His grandam&#8217;s wrongs, and not his mother&#8217;s shames,<br>
Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,<br>
Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;<br>
Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed<br>
To do him justice and revenge on you.</p>

Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp<br>
The dominations, royalties and rights<br>
Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld&#8217;st son&#8217;s
son,<br>
Infortunate in nothing but in thee:<br>
Thy sins are visited in this poor child;<br>
The canon of the law is laid on him,<br>
Being but the second generation<br>
Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.</p>

That he is not only plagued for her sin,<br>
But God hath made her sin and her the plague<br>
On this removed issue, plague for her<br>
And with her plague; her sin his injury,<br>
Her injury the beadle to her sin,<br>
All punish&#8217;d in the person of this child,<br>
And all for her; a plague upon her!</p>

A will that bars the title of thy son.</p>

It ill beseems this presence to cry aim<br>
To these ill-tuned repetitions.<br>
Some trumpet summon hither to the walls<br>
These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak<br>
Whose title they admit, Arthur&#8217;s or John&#8217;s.</p>

Citizens upon the walls</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>

You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">You loving men of Angiers, Arthur&#8217;s
subjects,<br>
Our trumpet call&#8217;d you to this gentle parle&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">For our advantage; therefore hear us first.<br>
These flags of France, that are advanced here<br>
Before the eye and prospect of your town,<br>
Have hither march&#8217;d to your endamagement:<br>
The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,<br>
And ready mounted are they to spit forth<br>
Their iron indignation &#8217;gainst your walls:<br>
All preparation for a bloody siege<br>
All merciless proceeding by these French<br>
Confronts your city&#8217;s eyes, your winking gates;<br>
And but for our approach those sleeping stones,<br>
That as a waist doth girdle you about,<br>
By the compulsion of their ordinance<br>
By this time from their fixed beds of lime<br>
Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made<br>
For bloody power to rush upon your peace.<br>
But on the sight of us your lawful king,<br>
Who painfully with much expedient march<br>
Have brought a countercheque before your gates,<br>
To save unscratch&#8217;d your city&#8217;s threatened cheeks,<br>
Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;<br>
And now, instead of bullets wrapp&#8217;d in fire,<br>
To make a shaking fever in your walls,<br>
They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,<br>
To make a faithless error in your ears:<br>
Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,<br>
And let us in, your king, whose labour&#8217;d spirits,<br>
Forwearied in this action of swift speed,<br>
Crave harbourage within your city walls.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">When I have said, make answer to us both.<br>
Lo, in this right hand, whose protection<br>
Is most divinely vow&#8217;d upon the right<br>
Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,<br>
Son to the elder brother of this man,<br>
And king o&#8217;er him and all that he enjoys:<br>
For this down-trodden equity, we tread<br>
In warlike march these greens before your town,<br>
Being no further enemy to you<br>
Than the constraint of hospitable zeal<br>
In the relief of this oppressed child<br>
Religiously provokes. Be pleased then<br>
To pay that duty which you truly owe<br>
To that owes it, namely this young prince:<br>
And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,<br>
Save in aspect, hath all offence seal&#8217;d up;<br>
Our cannons&#8217; malice vainly shall be spent<br>
Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;<br>
And with a blessed and unvex&#8217;d retire,<br>
With unhack&#8217;d swords and helmets all unbruised,<br>
We will bear home that lusty blood again<br>
Which here we came to spout against your town,<br>
And leave your children, wives and you in peace.<br>
But if you fondly pass our proffer&#8217;d offer,<br>
&#8217;Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls<br>
Can hide you from our messengers of war,<br>
Though all these English and their discipline<br>
Were harbour&#8217;d in their rude circumference.<br>
Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,<br>
In that behalf which we have challenged it?<br>
Or shall we give the signal to our rage<br>
And stalk in blood to our possession?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">In brief, we are the king of England&#8217;s
subjects:<br>
For him, and in his right, we hold this town.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">That can we not; but he that proves the king,<br>
To him will we prove loyal: till that time<br>
Have we ramm&#8217;d up our gates against the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Doth not the crown of England prove the king?<br>
And if not that, I bring you witnesses,<br>
Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England&#8217;s breed,&#8212;</p>

Many a widow&#8217;s husband grovelling lies,<br>
Coldly embracing the discolour&#8217;d earth;<br>
And victory, with little loss, doth play<br>
Upon the dancing banners of the French,<br>

Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen&#8217;s blood;<br>
There stuck no plume in any English crest<br>
That is removed by a staff of France;<br>
Our colours do return in those same hands<br>
That did display them when we first march&#8217;d forth;<br>
And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come<br>
Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,<br>
Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:<br>
Open your gates and gives the victors way.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,<br>
From first to last, the onset and retire<br>
Of both your armies; whose equality<br>
By our best eyes cannot be censured:<br>
Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;<br>
Strength match&#8217;d with strength, and power confronted
power:<br>
Both are alike; and both alike we like.<br>
One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,<br>

In this hot trial, more than we of France;<br>
Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,<br>

Your royal presences be ruled by me:<br>
Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,<br>
Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend<br>
Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:<br>
By east and west let France and England mount<br>
Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,<br>
Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl&#8217;d down<br>
The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:<br>
I&#8217;ld play incessantly upon these jades,<br>
Even till unfenced desolation<br>
Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.<br>
That done, dissever your united strengths,<br>
And part your mingled colours once again;<br>
Turn face to face and bloody point to point;<br>
Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth<br>
Out of one side her happy minion,<br>
To whom in favour she shall give the day,<br>
And kiss him with a glorious victory.<br>
How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?<br>
Smacks it not something of the policy?</p>

<p class="speech">Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,<br>
I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers<br>
And lay this Angiers even to the ground;<br>
Then after fight who shall be king of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">An if thou hast the mettle of a king,<br>
Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,<br>
Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,<br>
As we will ours, against these saucy walls;<br>
And when that we have dash&#8217;d them to the ground,<br>
Why then defy each other and pell-mell<br>
Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">We from the west will send destruction<br>
Into this city&#8217;s bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Austria</p>
<p class="speech">I from the north.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Our thunder from the south<br>
Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">O prudent discipline! From north to south:<br>
Austria and France shoot in each other&#8217;s mouth:<br>
I&#8217;ll stir them to it. Come, away, away!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to
stay,<br>
And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;<br>
Win you this city without stroke or wound;<br>
Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,<br>
That here come sacrifices for the field:<br>
Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">That daughter there of Spain, the Lady
Blanch,<br>
Is niece to England: look upon the years<br>
Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:<br>
If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,<br>
Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?<br>
If zealous love should go in search of virtue,<br>
Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?<br>
If love ambitious sought a match of birth,<br>
Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?<br>
Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,<br>
Is the young Dauphin every way complete:<br>
If not complete of, say he is not she;<br>
And she again wants nothing, to name want,<br>
If want it be not that she is not he:<br>
He is the half part of a blessed man,<br>
Left to be finished by such as she;<br>
And she a fair divided excellence,<br>
Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.<br>
O, two such silver currents, when they join,<br>
Do glorify the banks that bound them in;<br>
And two such shores to two such streams made one,<br>
Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,<br>
To these two princes, if you marry them.<br>
This union shall do more than battery can<br>
To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,<br>
With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,<br>
The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,<br>
And give you entrance: but without this match,<br>
The sea enraged is not half so deaf,<br>
Lions more confident, mountains and rocks<br>
More free from motion, no, not Death himself<br>
In moral fury half so peremptory,<br>
As we to keep this city.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s a stay<br>
That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death<br>
Out of his rags! Here&#8217;s a large mouth, indeed,<br>
That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,<br>
Talks as familiarly of roaring lions<br>
As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!<br>
What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?<br>
He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;<br>
He gives the bastinado with his tongue:<br>
Our ears are cudgell&#8217;d; not a word of his<br>
But buffets better than a fist of France:<br>
Zounds! I was never so bethump&#8217;d with words<br>
Since I first call&#8217;d my brother&#8217;s father dad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Son, list to this conjunction, make this
match;<br>
Give with our niece a dowry large enough:<br>
For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie<br>
Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,<br>
That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe<br>
The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.<br>
I see a yielding in the looks of France;<br>
Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls<br>
Are capable of this ambition,<br>
Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath<br>
Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,<br>
Cool and congeal again to what it was.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Why answer not the double majesties<br>
This friendly treaty of our threaten&#8217;d town?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">Speak England first, that hath been forward
first<br>
To speak unto this city: what say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,<br>
Can in this book of beauty read &#8216;I love,&#8217;<br>
Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:<br>
For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,<br>
And all that we upon this side the sea,<br>
Except this city now by us besieged,<br>
Find liable to our crown and dignity,<br>
Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich<br>
In titles, honours and promotions,<br>
As she in beauty, education, blood,<br>
Holds hand with any princess of the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou, boy? look in the
lady&#8217;s face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">I do, my lord; and in her eye I find<br>
A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,<br>
The shadow of myself form&#8217;d in her eye:<br>
Which being but the shadow of your son,<br>
Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:<br>
I do protest I never loved myself<br>
Till now infixed I beheld myself<br>
Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Whispers with
Blanch</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!<br>
Hang&#8217;d in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!<br>
And quarter&#8217;d in her heart! he doth espy<br>
Himself love&#8217;s traitor: this is pity now,<br>
That hang&#8217;d and drawn and quartered, there should be<br>
In such a love so vile a lout as he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Blanch</p>
<p class="speech">My uncle&#8217;s will in this respect is
mine:<br>
If he see aught in you that makes him like,<br>
That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,<br>
I can with ease translate it to my will;<br>
Or if you will, to speak more properly,<br>
I will enforce it easily to my love.<br>
Further I will not flatter you, my lord,<br>
That all I see in you is worthy love,<br>
Than this; that nothing do I see in you,<br>
Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,<br>
That I can find should merit any hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What say these young ones? What say you my
niece?</p>
<p class="speaker">Blanch</p>
<p class="speech">That she is bound in honour still to do<br>
What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this
lady?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;<br>
For I do love her most unfeignedly.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,<br>
Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,<br>
With her to thee; and this addition more,<br>
Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.<br>
Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,<br>
Command thy son and daughter to join hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">It likes us well; young princes, close your
hands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Austria</p>
<p class="speech">And your lips too; for I am well assured<br>
That I did so when I was first assured.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,<br>
Let in that amity which you have made;<br>
For at Saint Mary&#8217;s chapel presently<br>
The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.<br>
Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?<br>
I know she is not, for this match made up<br>
Her presence would have interrupted much:<br>
Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">She is sad and passionate at your highness&#8217;
tent.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">And, by my faith, this league that we have
made<br>
Will give her sadness very little cure.<br>
Brother of England, how may we content<br>
This widow lady? In her right we came;<br>
Which we, God knows, have turn&#8217;d another way,<br>
To our own vantage.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">We will heal up all;<br>
For we&#8217;ll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne<br>
And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town<br>
We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;<br>
Some speedy messenger bid her repair<br>
To our solemnity: I trust we shall,<br>
If not fill up the measure of her will,<br>
Yet in some measure satisfy her so<br>
That we shall stop her exclamation.<br>
Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,<br>
To this unlook&#8217;d for, unprepared pomp.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but the
Bastard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!<br>
John, to stop Arthur&#8217;s title in the whole,<br>
Hath willingly departed with a part,<br>
And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,<br>
Whom zeal and charity brought to the field<br>
As God&#8217;s own soldier, rounded in the ear<br>
With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,<br>
That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,<br>
That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,<br>
Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,<br>
Who, having no external thing to lose<br>
But the word &#8216;maid,&#8217; cheats the poor maid of that,<br>
That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,<br>
Commodity, the bias of the world,<br>
The world, who of itself is peised well,<br>
Made to run even upon even ground,<br>
Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,<br>
This sway of motion, this Commodity,<br>
Makes it take head from all indifferency,<br>
From all direction, purpose, course, intent:<br>
And this same bias, this Commodity,<br>
This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,<br>
Clapp&#8217;d on the outward eye of fickle France,<br>
Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,<br>
From a resolved and honourable war,<br>
To a most base and vile-concluded peace.<br>
And why rail I on this Commodity?<br>
But for because he hath not woo&#8217;d me yet:<br>
Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,<br>
When his fair angels would salute my palm;<br>
But for my hand, as unattempted yet,<br>
Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.<br>
Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail<br>
And say there is no sin but to be rich;<br>
And being rich, my virtue then shall be<br>
To say there is no vice but beggary.<br>
Since kings break faith upon commodity,<br>
Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.</p>

It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:<br>
Be well advised, tell o&#8217;er thy tale again:<br>
It cannot be; thou dost but say &#8217;tis so:<br>
I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word<br>
Is but the vain breath of a common man:<br>
Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;<br>
I have a king&#8217;s oath to the contrary.<br>
Thou shalt be punish&#8217;d for thus frighting me,<br>
For I am sick and capable of fears,<br>
Oppress&#8217;d with wrongs and therefore full of fears,<br>
A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,<br>
A woman, naturally born to fears;<br>
And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,<br>
With my vex&#8217;d spirits I cannot take a truce,<br>
But they will quake and tremble all this day.<br>
What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?<br>
Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?<br>
What means that hand upon that breast of thine?<br>
Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,<br>

Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?<br>

Nature and Fortune join&#8217;d to make thee great:<br>
Of Nature&#8217;s gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,<br>
And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,<br>
She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;<br>
She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,<br>
And with her golden hand hath pluck&#8217;d on France<br>
To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,<br>
And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.<br>
France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,<br>
That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!<br>
Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?<br>
Envenom him with words, or get thee gone<br>
And leave those woes alone which I alone<br>
Am bound to under-bear.</p>

Why thou against the church, our holy mother,<br>
So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce<br>

Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name<br>
So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,<br>

Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England<br>
Add thus much more, that no Italian priest<br>
Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;<br>
But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,<br>
So under Him that great supremacy,<br>
Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,<br>
Without the assistance of a mortal hand:<br>
So tell the pope, all reverence set apart<br>

And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,<br>
Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,<br>
Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,<br>
Though you and all the rest so grossly led<br>
This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,<br>
Yet I alone, alone do me oppose<br>

Good father cardinal, cry thou amen<br>
To my keen curses; for without my wrong<br>
There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.</p>

Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!</p>

<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">What canst thou say but will perplex thee
more,<br>
If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">Good reverend father, make my person yours,<br>
And tell me how you would bestow yourself.<br>
This royal hand and mine are newly knit,<br>
And the conjunction of our inward souls<br>
Married in league, coupled and linked together<br>
With all religious strength of sacred vows;<br>
The latest breath that gave the sound of words<br>
Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love<br>
Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,<br>
And even before this truce, but new before,<br>
No longer than we well could wash our hands<br>
To clap this royal bargain up of peace,<br>
Heaven knows, they were besmear&#8217;d and over-stain&#8217;d<br>
With slaughter&#8217;s pencil, where revenge did paint<br>
The fearful difference of incensed kings:<br>
And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,<br>
So newly join&#8217;d in love, so strong in both,<br>
Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?<br>
Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,<br>
Make such unconstant children of ourselves,<br>
As now again to snatch our palm from palm,<br>
Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed<br>
Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,<br>
And make a riot on the gentle brow<br>
Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,<br>
My reverend father, let it not be so!<br>
Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose<br>
Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest<br>
To do your pleasure and continue friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">All form is formless, order orderless,<br>
Save what is opposite to England&#8217;s love.<br>
Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,<br>
Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,<br>
A mother&#8217;s curse, on her revolting son.<br>
France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,<br>
A chafed lion by the mortal paw,<br>
A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,<br>
Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Philip</p>
<p class="speech">I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;<br>
And like a civil war set&#8217;st oath to oath,<br>
Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow<br>
First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform&#8217;d,<br>
That is, to be the champion of our church!<br>
What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself<br>
And may not be performed by thyself,<br>
For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss<br>
Is not amiss when it is truly done,<br>
And being not done, where doing tends to ill,<br>
The truth is then most done not doing it:<br>
The better act of purposes mistook<br>
Is to mistake again; though indirect,<br>
Yet indirection thereby grows direct,<br>
And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire<br>
Within the scorched veins of one new-burn&#8217;d.<br>
It is religion that doth make vows kept;<br>
But thou hast sworn against religion,<br>
By what thou swear&#8217;st against the thing thou
swear&#8217;st,<br>
And makest an oath the surety for thy truth<br>
Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure<br>
To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;<br>
Else what a mockery should it be to swear!<br>
But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;<br>
And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.<br>
Therefore thy later vows against thy first<br>
Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;<br>
And better conquest never canst thou make<br>
Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts<br>
Against these giddy loose suggestions:<br>
Upon which better part our prayers come in,<br>
If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know<br>
The peril of our curses light on thee<br>
So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,<br>
But in despair die under their black weight.</p>

Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.<br>

I had a thing to say, but let it go:<br>
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,<br>
Attended with the pleasures of the world,<br>
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds<br>
To give me audience: if the midnight bell<br>
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,<br>
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;<br>
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,<br>
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,<br>
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,<br>
Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,<br>
Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,<br>
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men&#8217;s eyes<br>
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,<br>

For then, &#8217;tis like I should forget myself:<br>
O, if I could, what grief should I forget!<br>
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,<br>
And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;<br>
For being not mad but sensible of grief,<br>
My reasonable part produces reason<br>

And, father cardinal, I have heard you say<br>

If that be true, I shall see my boy again;<br>
For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,<br>
To him that did but yesterday suspire,<br>
There was not such a gracious creature born.<br>
But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud<br>
And chase the native beauty from his cheek<br>
And he will look as hollow as a ghost,<br>
As dim and meagre as an ague&#8217;s fit,<br>
And so he&#8217;ll die; and, rising so again,<br>

For even the breath of what I mean to speak<br>
Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,<br>
Out of the path which shall directly lead<br>
Thy foot to England&#8217;s throne; and therefore mark.<br>
John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be<br>
That, whiles warm life plays in that infant&#8217;s veins,<br>
The misplaced John should entertain an hour,<br>
One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.<br>

fall?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,<br>
May then make all the claim that Arthur did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">How green you are and fresh in this old
world!<br>
John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;<br>
For he that steeps his safety in true blood<br>
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.<br>
This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts<br>
Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,<br>
That none so small advantage shall step forth<br>
To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;<br>
No natural exhalation in the sky,<br>
No scope of nature, no distemper&#8217;d day,<br>
No common wind, no customed event,<br>
But they will pluck away his natural cause<br>
And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,<br>
Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,<br>
Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">May be he will not touch young Arthur&#8217;s
life,<br>
But hold himself safe in his prisonment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,<br>
If that young Arthur be not gone already,<br>
Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts<br>
Of all his people shall revolt from him<br>
And kiss the lips of unacquainted change<br>
And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath<br>
Out of the bloody fingers&#8217; ends of John.<br>
Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:<br>
And, O, what better matter breeds for you<br>
Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge<br>
Is now in England, ransacking the church,<br>
Offending charity: if but a dozen French<br>
Were there in arms, they would be as a call<br>
To train ten thousand English to their side,<br>
Or as a little snow, tumbled about,<br>
Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,<br>
Go with me to the king: &#8217;tis wonderful<br>
What may be wrought out of their discontent,<br>
Now that their souls are topful of offence.<br>
For England go: I will whet on the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">Strong reasons make strong actions: let us
go:<br>
If you say ay, the king will not say no.</p>

<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand<br>
Within the arras: when I strike my foot<br>
Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,<br>
And bind the boy which you shall find with me<br>
Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Executioner</p>

<p class="speech">Good morrow, Hubert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, little prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">As little prince, having so great a title<br>
To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I have been merrier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Mercy on me!<br>
Methinks no body should be sad but I:<br>
Yet, I remember, when I was in France,<br>
Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,<br>
Only for wantonness. By my christendom,<br>
So I were out of prison and kept sheep,<br>
I should be as merry as the day is long;<br>
And so I would be here, but that I doubt<br>
My uncle practises more harm to me:<br>
He is afraid of me and I of him:<br>
Is it my fault that I was Geffrey&#8217;s son?<br>
No, indeed, is&#8217;t not; and I would to heaven<br>
I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If I talk to
him, with his innocent prate<br>
He will awake my mercy which lies dead:<br>
Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:<br>
In sooth, I would you were a little sick,<br>
That I might sit all night and watch with you:<br>
I warrant I love you more than you do me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> His words do

<p class="speech">How now, foolish rheum!<br>
Turning dispiteous torture out of door!<br>
I must be brief, lest resolution drop<br>
Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.<br>
Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:<br>
Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Young boy, I must.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And will you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">And I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Have you the heart? When your head did but
ache,<br>
I knit my handercher about your brows,<br>
The best I had, a princess wrought it me,<br>
And I did never ask it you again;<br>
And with my hand at midnight held your head,<br>
And like the watchful minutes to the hour,<br>
Still and anon cheer&#8217;d up the heavy time,<br>
Saying, &#8216;What lack you?&#8217; and &#8216;Where lies your
grief?&#8217;<br>
Or &#8216;What good love may I perform for you?&#8217;<br>
Many a poor man&#8217;s son would have lien still<br>
And ne&#8217;er have spoke a loving word to you;<br>
But you at your sick service had a prince.<br>
Nay, you may think my love was crafty love<br>
And call it cunning: do, an if you will:<br>
If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,<br>
Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?<br>
These eyes that never did nor never shall<br>
So much as frown on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">I have sworn to do it;<br>
And with hot irons must I burn them out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!<br>
The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,<br>
Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears<br>
And quench his fiery indignation<br>
Even in the matter of mine innocence;<br>
Nay, after that, consume away in rust<br>
But for containing fire to harm mine eye.<br>
Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer&#8217;d iron?<br>
An if an angel should have come to me<br>
And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,<br>
I would not have believed him,&#8212;no tongue but
Hubert&#8217;s.</p>

Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?<br>
I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.<br>
For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!<br>
Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,<br>
And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;<br>
I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,<br>
Nor look upon the iron angerly:<br>
Thrust but these men away, and I&#8217;ll forgive you,<br>
Whatever torment you do put me to.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Go, stand within; let me alone with him.</p>

<p class="speech">Alas, I then have chid away my friend!<br>
He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:<br>
Let him come back, that his compassion may<br>
Give life to yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Come, boy, prepare yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Is there no remedy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">None, but to lose your eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven, that there were but a mote in
yours,<br>
A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,<br>
Any annoyance in that precious sense!<br>
Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,<br>
Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Is this your promise? go to, hold your
tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues<br>
Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:<br>
Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;<br>
Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,<br>
So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.<br>
Though to no use but still to look on you!<br>
Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold<br>
And would not harm me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">I can heat it, boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with
grief,<br>
Being create for comfort, to be used<br>
In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;<br>
There is no malice in this burning coal;<br>
The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out<br>
And strew&#8217;d repentent ashes on his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">An if you do, you will but make it blush<br>
And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:<br>
Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;<br>
And like a dog that is compell&#8217;d to fight,<br>
Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.<br>
All things that you should use to do me wrong<br>
Deny their office: only you do lack<br>
That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,<br>
Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye<br>
For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:<br>
Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,<br>
With this same very iron to burn them out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">O, now you look like Hubert! all this while<br>
You were disguised.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Peace; no more. Adieu.<br>
Your uncle must not know but you are dead;<br>
I&#8217;ll fill these dogged spies with false reports:<br>
And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,<br>
That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,<br>
Will not offend thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Arthur</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Silence; no more: go closely in with me:<br>
Much danger do I undergo for thee.</p>

<h4>Scene II. King John&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King John, Pembroke,
Salisbury, and other Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Here once again we sit, once again
crown&#8217;d,<br>
And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">This &#8216;once again,&#8217; but that your
highness pleased,<br>
Was once superfluous: you were crown&#8217;d before,<br>
And that high royalty was ne&#8217;er pluck&#8217;d off,<br>
The faiths of men ne&#8217;er stained with revolt;<br>
Fresh expectation troubled not the land<br>
With any long&#8217;d-for change or better state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, to be possess&#8217;d with double
pomp,<br>
To guard a title that was rich before,<br>
To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,<br>
To throw a perfume on the violet,<br>
To smooth the ice, or add another hue<br>
Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light<br>
To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,<br>
Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">But that your royal pleasure must be done,<br>
This act is as an ancient tale new told,<br>
And in the last repeating troublesome,<br>
Being urged at a time unseasonable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">In this the antique and well noted face<br>
Of plain old form is much disfigured;<br>
And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,<br>
It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,<br>
Startles and frights consideration,<br>
Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,<br>
For putting on so new a fashion&#8217;d robe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">When workmen strive to do better than well,<br>
They do confound their skill in covetousness;<br>
And oftentimes excusing of a fault<br>
Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,<br>
As patches set upon a little breach<br>
Discredit more in hiding of the fault<br>
Than did the fault before it was so patch&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">To this effect, before you were new
crown&#8217;d,<br>
We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness<br>
To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,<br>
Since all and every part of what we would<br>
Doth make a stand at what your highness will.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Some reasons of this double coronation<br>
I have possess&#8217;d you with and think them strong;<br>
And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,<br>
I shall indue you with: meantime but ask<br>
What you would have reform&#8217;d that is not well,<br>
And well shall you perceive how willingly<br>
I will both hear and grant you your requests.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,<br>
To sound the purpose of all their hearts,<br>
Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,<br>
Your safety, for the which myself and them<br>
Bend their best studies, heartily request<br>
The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint<br>
Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent<br>
To break into this dangerous argument,&#8212;<br>
If what in rest you have in right you hold,<br>
Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend<br>
The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up<br>
Your tender kinsman and to choke his days<br>
With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth<br>
The rich advantage of good exercise?<br>
That the time&#8217;s enemies may not have this<br>
To grace occasions, let it be our suit<br>
That you have bid us ask his liberty;<br>
Which for our goods we do no further ask<br>
Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,<br>
Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hubert</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so: I do commit his youth<br>
To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Taking him apart</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">This is the man should do the bloody deed;<br>
He show&#8217;d his warrant to a friend of mine:<br>
The image of a wicked heinous fault<br>
Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his<br>
Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;<br>
And I do fearfully believe &#8217;tis done,<br>
What we so fear&#8217;d he had a charge to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">The colour of the king doth come and go<br>
Between his purpose and his conscience,<br>
Like heralds &#8217;twixt two dreadful battles set:<br>
His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence<br>
The foul corruption of a sweet child&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">We cannot hold mortality&#8217;s strong hand:<br>
Good lords, although my will to give is living,<br>
The suit which you demand is gone and dead:<br>
He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed we fear&#8217;d his sickness was past
cure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed we heard how near his death he was<br>
Before the child himself felt he was sick:<br>
This must be answer&#8217;d either here or hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?<br>
Think you I bear the shears of destiny?<br>
Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">It is apparent foul play; and &#8217;tis
shame<br>
That greatness should so grossly offer it:<br>
So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I&#8217;ll go with
thee,<br>
And find the inheritance of this poor child,<br>
His little kingdom of a forced grave.<br>
That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,<br>
Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!<br>
This must not be thus borne: this will break out<br>
To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lords</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">They burn in indignation. I repent:<br>
There is no sure foundation set on blood,<br>
No certain life achieved by others&#8217; death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speech">A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood<br>
That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?<br>
So foul a sky clears not without a storm:<br>
Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">From France to England. Never such a power<br>
For any foreign preparation<br>
Was levied in the body of a land.<br>
The copy of your speed is learn&#8217;d by them;<br>
For when you should be told they do prepare,<br>
The tidings come that they are all arrived.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?<br>
Where hath it slept? Where is my mother&#8217;s care,<br>
That such an army could be drawn in France,<br>
And she not hear of it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, her ear<br>
Is stopp&#8217;d with dust; the first of April died<br>
Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,<br>
The Lady Constance in a frenzy died<br>
Three days before: but this from rumour&#8217;s tongue<br>
I idly heard; if true or false I know not.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!<br>
O, make a league with me, till I have pleased<br>
My discontented peers! What! mother dead!<br>
How wildly then walks my estate in France!<br>
Under whose conduct came those powers of France<br>
That thou for truth givest out are landed here?</p>

<p class="speech">Under the Dauphin.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>

<p class="speech">Now, what says the world<br>
To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff<br>
My head with more ill news, for it is full.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">But if you be afeard to hear the worst,<br>
Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.</p>

<p class="speech">Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed<br>
Under the tide: but now I breathe again<br>
Aloft the flood, and can give audience<br>
To any tongue, speak it of what it will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">How I have sped among the clergymen,<br>
The sums I have collected shall express.<br>
But as I travell&#8217;d hither through the land,<br>
I find the people strangely fantasied;<br>
Possess&#8217;d with rumours, full of idle dreams,<br>
Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:<br>
And here a prophet, that I brought with me<br>
From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found<br>
With many hundreds treading on his heels;<br>
To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,<br>
That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,<br>
Your highness should deliver up your crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Peter</p>
<p class="speech">Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Hubert, away with him; imprison him;<br>
And on that day at noon whereon he says<br>
I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang&#8217;d.<br>
Deliver him to safety; and return,<br>
For I must use thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Hubert with
Peter</span></p>
<p class="speech">O my gentle cousin,<br>
Hear&#8217;st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">The French, my lord; men&#8217;s mouths are full
of it:<br>
Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,<br>
With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,<br>
And others more, going to seek the grave<br>
Of Arthur, who they say is kill&#8217;d to-night<br>
On your suggestion.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle kinsman, go,<br>
And thrust thyself into their companies:<br>
I have a way to win their loves again;<br>
Bring them before me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">I will seek them out.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.<br>
O, let me have no subject enemies,<br>
When adverse foreigners affright my towns<br>
With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!<br>
Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,<br>
And fly like thought from them to me again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.<br>
Go after him; for he perhaps shall need<br>
Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;<br>
And be thou he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;With all my heart, my liege.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Hubert</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, they say five moons were seen
to-night;<br>
Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about<br>
The other four in wondrous motion.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Five moons!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Old men and beldams in the streets<br>
Do prophesy upon it dangerously:<br>
Young Arthur&#8217;s death is common in their mouths:<br>
And when they talk of him, they shake their heads<br>
And whisper one another in the ear;<br>
And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer&#8217;s wrist,<br>
Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,<br>
With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.<br>
I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,<br>
The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,<br>
With open mouth swallowing a tailor&#8217;s news;<br>
Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,<br>
Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste<br>
Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,<br>
Told of a many thousand warlike French<br>
That were embattailed and rank&#8217;d in Kent:<br>
Another lean unwash&#8217;d artificer<br>
Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Why seek&#8217;st thou to possess me with these
fears?<br>
Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur&#8217;s death?<br>
Thy hand hath murder&#8217;d him: I had a mighty cause<br>
To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">It is the curse of kings to be attended<br>
By slaves that take their humours for a warrant<br>
To break within the bloody house of life,<br>
And on the winking of authority<br>
To understand a law, to know the meaning<br>
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns<br>
More upon humour than advised respect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Here is your hand and seal for what I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">O, when the last account &#8217;twixt heaven and
earth<br>
Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal<br>
Witness against us to damnation!<br>
How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds<br>
Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,<br>
A fellow by the hand of nature mark&#8217;d,<br>
Quoted and sign&#8217;d to do a deed of shame,<br>
This murder had not come into my mind:<br>
But taking note of thy abhorr&#8217;d aspect,<br>
Finding thee fit for bloody villany,<br>
Apt, liable to be employ&#8217;d in danger,<br>
I faintly broke with thee of Arthur&#8217;s death;<br>
And thou, to be endeared to a king,<br>
Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">My lord&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause<br>
When I spake darkly what I purposed,<br>
Or turn&#8217;d an eye of doubt upon my face,<br>
As bid me tell my tale in express words,<br>
Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,<br>
And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:<br>
But thou didst understand me by my signs<br>
And didst in signs again parley with sin;<br>
Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,<br>
And consequently thy rude hand to act<br>
The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.<br>
Out of my sight, and never see me more!<br>
My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,<br>
Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:<br>
Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,<br>
This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,<br>
Hostility and civil tumult reigns<br>
Between my conscience and my cousin&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hubert</p>
<p class="speech">Arm you against your other enemies,<br>
I&#8217;ll make a peace between your soul and you.<br>
Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine<br>
Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,<br>
Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.<br>
Within this bosom never enter&#8217;d yet<br>
The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;<br>
And you have slander&#8217;d nature in my form,<br>
Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,<br>
Is yet the cover of a fairer mind<br>
Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,<br>
Throw this report on their incensed rage,<br>
And make them tame to their obedience!<br>
Forgive the comment that my passion made<br>
Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,<br>
And foul imaginary eyes of blood<br>
Presented thee more hideous than thou art.<br>
O, answer not, but to my closet bring<br>
The angry lords with all expedient haste.<br>
I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.</p>

I am afraid; and yet I&#8217;ll venture it.<br>

The king by me requests your presence straight.</p>

We will not line his thin bestained cloak<br>
With our pure honours, nor attend the foot<br>
That leaves the print of blood where&#8217;er it walks.<br>

Or have you read or heard? or could you think?<br>
Or do you almost think, although you see,<br>
That you do see? could thought, without this object,<br>
Form such another? This is the very top,<br>
The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,<br>
Of murder&#8217;s arms: this is the bloodiest shame,<br>
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,<br>
That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage<br>
Presented to the tears of soft remorse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pembroke</p>
<p class="speech">All murders past do stand excused in this:<br>
And this, so sole and so unmatchable,<br>
Shall give a holiness, a purity,<br>
To the yet unbegotten sin of times;<br>
And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,<br>
Exampled by this heinous spectacle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>

We had a kind of light what would ensue:<br>
It is the shameful work of Hubert&#8217;s hand;<br>
The practise and the purpose of the king:<br>
From whose obedience I forbid my soul,<br>
Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,<br>
And breathing to his breathless excellence<br>
The incense of a vow, a holy vow,<br>
Never to taste the pleasures of the world,<br>
Never to be infected with delight,<br>
Nor conversant with ease and idleness,<br>
Till I have set a glory to this hand,<br>
By giving it the worship of revenge.</p>

Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget<br>
Your worth, your greatness and nobility.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bigot</p>

If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,<br>
Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,<br>
I&#8217;ll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;<br>
Or I&#8217;ll so maul you and your toasting-iron,<br>

I honour&#8217;d him, I loved him, and will weep<br>
My date of life out for his sweet life&#8217;s loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,<br>
For villany is not without such rheum;<br>
And he, long traded in it, makes it seem<br>
Like rivers of remorse and innocency.<br>
Away with me, all you whose souls abhor<br>

For I am stifled with this smell of sin.</p>

Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam<br>
To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,<br>

And it shall be as all the ocean,<br>

I do suspect thee very grievously.</p>

How easy dost thou take all England up!<br>
From forth this morsel of dead royalty,<br>
The life, the right and truth of all this realm<br>

To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth<br>
The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.<br>
Now for the bare-pick&#8217;d bone of majesty<br>
Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest<br>
And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:<br>
Now powers from home and discontents at home<br>
Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,<br>
As doth a raven on a sick-fall&#8217;n beast,<br>
The imminent decay of wrested pomp.<br>
Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can<br>

<p class="speech">Outside or inside, I will not return<br>
Till my attempt so much be glorified<br>
As to my ample hope was promised<br>
Before I drew this gallant head of war,<br>
And cull&#8217;d these fiery spirits from the world,<br>
To outlook conquest and to win renown<br>
Even in the jaws of danger and of death.</p>

<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">According to the fair play of the world,<br>
Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:<br>
My holy lord of Milan, from the king<br>
I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;<br>
And, as you answer, I do know the scope<br>
And warrant limited unto my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,<br>
And will not temporize with my entreaties;<br>
He flatly says he&#8217;ll not lay down his arms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">By all the blood that ever fury breathed,<br>
The youth says well. Now hear our English king;<br>
For thus his royalty doth speak in me.<br>
He is prepared, and reason too he should:<br>
This apish and unmannerly approach,<br>
This harness&#8217;d masque and unadvised revel,<br>
This unhair&#8217;d sauciness and boyish troops,<br>
The king doth smile at; and is well prepared<br>
To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,<br>
From out the circle of his territories.<br>
That hand which had the strength, even at your door,<br>
To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,<br>
To dive like buckets in concealed wells,<br>
To crouch in litter of your stable planks,<br>
To lie like pawns lock&#8217;d up in chests and trunks,<br>
To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out<br>
In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake<br>
Even at the crying of your nation&#8217;s crow,<br>
Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;<br>
Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,<br>
That in your chambers gave you chastisement?<br>
No: know the gallant monarch is in arms<br>
And like an eagle o&#8217;er his aery towers,<br>
To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.<br>
And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,<br>
You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb<br>
Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;<br>
For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids<br>
Like Amazons come tripping after drums,<br>
Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,<br>
Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts<br>
To fierce and bloody inclination.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">There end thy brave, and turn thy face in
peace;<br>
We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;<br>
We hold our time too precious to be spent<br>
With such a brabbler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Pandulph</p>
<p class="speech">Give me leave to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;We will attend to neither.<br>
Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war<br>
Plead for our interest and our being here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry
out;<br>
And so shall you, being beaten: do but start<br>
An echo with the clamour of thy drum,<br>
And even at hand a drum is ready braced<br>
That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;<br>
Sound but another, and another shall<br>
As loud as thine rattle the welkin&#8217;s ear<br>
And mock the deep-mouth&#8217;d thunder: for at hand,<br>
Not trusting to this halting legate here,<br>
Whom he hath used rather for sport than need<br>
Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits<br>
A bare-ribb&#8217;d death, whose office is this day<br>
To feast upon whole thousands of the French.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lewis</p>
<p class="speech">Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.</p>
