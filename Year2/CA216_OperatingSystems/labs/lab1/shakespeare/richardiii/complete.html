<h4>Scene I. London. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester,
solus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now is the winter of our discontent<br>
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<br>
And all the clouds that lour&#8217;d upon our house<br>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<br>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;<br>
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;<br>
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,<br>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<br>
Grim-visaged war hath smooth&#8217;d his wrinkled front;<br>
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds<br>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<br>
He capers nimbly in a lady&#8217;s chamber<br>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<br>
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,<br>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<br>
I, that am rudely stamp&#8217;d, and want love&#8217;s majesty<br>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<br>
I, that am curtail&#8217;d of this fair proportion,<br>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<br>
Deformed, unfinish&#8217;d, sent before my time<br>
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,<br>
And that so lamely and unfashionable<br>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;<br>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<br>
Have no delight to pass away the time,<br>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun<br>
And descant on mine own deformity:<br>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,<br>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<br>
I am determined to prove a villain<br>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<br>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<br>
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,<br>
To set my brother Clarence and the king<br>
In deadly hate the one against the other:<br>
And if King Edward be as true and just<br>
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,<br>
This day should Clarence closely be mew&#8217;d up,<br>
About a prophecy, which says that &#8216;G&#8217;<br>
Of Edward&#8217;s heirs the murderer shall be.<br>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here<br>
Clarence comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clarence, guarded, and
Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speech">Brother, good day; what means this armed
guard<br>
That waits upon your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">His majesty<br>
Tendering my person&#8217;s safety, hath appointed<br>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Upon what cause?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Because my name is George.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;<br>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:<br>
O, belike his majesty hath some intent<br>
That you shall be new-christen&#8217;d in the Tower.<br>
But what&#8217;s the matter, Clarence? may I know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest<br>
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,<br>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;<br>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.<br>
And says a wizard told him that by G<br>
His issue disinherited should be;<br>
And, for my name of George begins with G,<br>
It follows in his thought that I am he.<br>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these<br>
Have moved his highness to commit me now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:<br>
&#8217;Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:<br>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, &#8217;tis she<br>
That tempers him to this extremity.<br>
Was it not she and that good man of worship,<br>
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,<br>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,<br>
From whence this present day he is deliver&#8217;d?<br>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, I think there&#8217;s no man is
secure<br>
But the queen&#8217;s kindred and night-walking heralds<br>
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.<br>
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant<br>
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Humbly complaining to her deity<br>
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell you what; I think it is our way,<br>
If we will keep in favour with the king,<br>
To be her men and wear her livery:<br>
The jealous o&#8217;erworn widow and herself,<br>
Since that our brother dubb&#8217;d them gentlewomen.<br>
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your graces both to pardon me;<br>
His majesty hath straitly given in charge<br>
That no man shall have private conference,<br>
Of what degree soever, with his brother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Even so; an&#8217;t please your worship,
Brakenbury,<br>
You may partake of any thing we say:<br>
We speak no treason, man: we say the king<br>
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen<br>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;<br>
We say that Shore&#8217;s wife hath a pretty foot,<br>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;<br>
And that the queen&#8217;s kindred are made gentle-folks:<br>
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee,
fellow,<br>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,<br>
Were best he do it secretly, alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">What one, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal<br>
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will
obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">We are the queen&#8217;s abjects, and must
obey.<br>
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;<br>
And whatsoever you will employ me in,<br>
Were it to call King Edward&#8217;s widow sister,<br>
I will perform it to enfranchise you.<br>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood<br>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I know it pleaseth neither of us well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;<br>
Meantime, have patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I must perforce. Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Clarence, Brakenbury,
and Guard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne&#8217;er
return.<br>
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,<br>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,<br>
If heaven will take the present at our hands.<br>
But who comes here? the new-deliver&#8217;d Hastings?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Good time of day unto my gracious lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">As much unto my good lord chamberlain!<br>
Well are you welcome to the open air.<br>
How hath your lordship brook&#8217;d imprisonment?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:<br>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks<br>
That were the cause of my imprisonment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence
too;<br>
For they that were your enemies are his,<br>
And have prevail&#8217;d as much on him as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">More pity that the eagle should be
mew&#8217;d,<br>
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What news abroad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">No news so bad abroad as this at home;<br>
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,<br>
And his physicians fear him mightily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.<br>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,<br>
And overmuch consumed his royal person:<br>
&#8217;Tis very grievous to be thought upon.<br>
What, is he in his bed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">He is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Go you before, and I will follow you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hastings</span></p>
<p class="speech">He cannot live, I hope; and must not die<br>
Till George be pack&#8217;d with post-horse up to heaven.<br>
I&#8217;ll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,<br>
With lies well steel&#8217;d with weighty arguments;<br>
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,<br>
Clarence hath not another day to live:<br>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,<br>
And leave the world for me to bustle in!<br>
For then I&#8217;ll marry Warwick&#8217;s youngest daughter.<br>
What though I kill&#8217;d her husband and her father?<br>
The readiest way to make the wench amends<br>
Is to become her husband and her father:<br>
The which will I; not all so much for love<br>
As for another secret close intent,<br>
By marrying her which I must reach unto.<br>
But yet I run before my horse to market:<br>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:<br>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. Another street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the corpse of King
Henry the Sixth, Gentlemen with halberds to guard it; Lady Anne
being the mourner</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Set down, set down your honourable load,<br>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,<br>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament<br>
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.<br>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!<br>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!<br>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!<br>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,<br>
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,<br>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter&#8217;d son,<br>
Stabb&#8217;d by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!<br>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,<br>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.<br>
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!<br>
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!<br>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!<br>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,<br>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,<br>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<br>
Or any creeping venom&#8217;d thing that lives!<br>
If ever he have child, abortive be it,<br>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<br>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<br>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;<br>
And that be heir to his unhappiness!<br>
If ever he have wife, let her he made<br>
A miserable by the death of him<br>
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!<br>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<br>
Taken from Paul&#8217;s to be interred there;<br>
And still, as you are weary of the weight,<br>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry&#8217;s corse.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it
down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What black magician conjures up this fiend,<br>
To stop devoted charitable deeds?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint
Paul,<br>
I&#8217;ll make a corse of him that disobeys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Unmanner&#8217;d dog! stand thou, when I
command:<br>
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,<br>
Or, by Saint Paul, I&#8217;ll strike thee to my foot,<br>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?<br>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,<br>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.<br>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!<br>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,<br>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Foul devil, for God&#8217;s sake, hence, and
trouble us not;<br>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,<br>
Fill&#8217;d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.<br>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,<br>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.<br>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry&#8217;s wounds<br>
Open their congeal&#8217;d mouths and bleed afresh!<br>
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;<br>
For &#8217;tis thy presence that exhales this blood<br>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;<br>
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,<br>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.<br>
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!<br>
O earth, which this blood drink&#8217;st revenge his death!<br>
Either heaven with lightning strike the
murderer dead,<br>
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,<br>
As thou dost swallow up this good king&#8217;s blood<br>
Which his hell-govern&#8217;d arm hath butchered!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Lady, you know no rules of charity,<br>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, thou know&#8217;st no law of God nor
man:<br>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But I know none, and therefore am no beast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">More wonderful, when angels are so angry.<br>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<br>
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,<br>
For these known evils, but to give me leave,<br>
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have<br>
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst
make<br>
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">By such despair, I should accuse myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand
excused;<br>
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,<br>
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Say that I slew them not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then they are not dead:<br>
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I did not kill your husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then he is alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward&#8217;s
hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret
saw<br>
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;<br>
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,<br>
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.<br>
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:<br>
Didst thou not kill this king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I grant ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me
too<br>
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!<br>
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let him thank me, that holp to send him
thither;<br>
For he was fitter for that place than earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And thou unfit for any place but hell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Some dungeon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Your bed-chamber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll rest betide the chamber where thou
liest!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">So will it, madam till I lie with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I hope so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,<br>
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,<br>
And fall somewhat into a slower method,<br>
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths<br>
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,<br>
As blameful as the executioner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your beauty was the cause of that effect;<br>
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep<br>
To undertake the death of all the world,<br>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,<br>
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">These eyes could never endure sweet
beauty&#8217;s wreck;<br>
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:<br>
As all the world is cheered by the sun,<br>
So I by that; it is my day, my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Black night o&#8217;ershade thy day, and death
thy life!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art
both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I would I were, to be revenged on thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">It is a quarrel most unnatural,<br>
To be revenged on him that loveth you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">It is a quarrel just and reasonable,<br>
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,<br>
Did it to help thee to a better husband.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">His better doth not breathe upon the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He lives that loves thee better than he
could.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Name him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Plantagenet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that was he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The selfsame name, but one of better nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Here.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She spitteth at
him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou spit at me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Never came poison from so sweet a place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Never hung poison on a fouler toad.<br>
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Would they were basilisks, to strike thee
dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I would they were, that I might die at once;<br>
For now they kill me with a living death.<br>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,<br>
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:<br>
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,<br>
No, when my father York and Edward wept,<br>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made<br>
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;<br>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,<br>
Told the sad story of my father&#8217;s death,<br>
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,<br>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks<br>
Like trees bedash&#8217;d with rain: in that sad time<br>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;<br>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,<br>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.<br>
I never sued to friend nor enemy;<br>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;<br>
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,<br>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">She looks scornfully at
him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were
made<br>
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.<br>
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,<br>
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;<br>
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.<br>
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,<br>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,<br>
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He lays his breast open: she
offers at it with his sword</span></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,<br>
But &#8217;twas thy beauty that provoked me.<br>
Nay, now dispatch; &#8217;twas I that stabb&#8217;d young
Edward,<br>
But &#8217;twas thy heavenly face that set me on.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Here she lets fall the
sword</span></p>
<p class="speech">Take up the sword again, or take up me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,<br>
I will not be the executioner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I have already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Tush, that was in thy rage:<br>
Speak it again, and, even with the word,<br>
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,<br>
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;<br>
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I would I knew thy heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis figured in my tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">I fear me both are false.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Then never man was true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, put up your sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Say, then, my peace is made.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">That shall you know hereafter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But shall I live in hope?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">All men, I hope, live so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe to wear this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">To take is not to give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.<br>
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;<br>
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.<br>
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may<br>
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,<br>
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">What is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">That it would please thee leave these sad
designs<br>
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,<br>
And presently repair to Crosby Place;<br>
Where, after I have solemnly interr&#8217;d<br>
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,<br>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,<br>
I will with all expedient duty see you:<br>
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,<br>
Grant me this boon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart; and much it joys me too,<br>
To see you are become so penitent.<br>
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Bid me farewell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis more than you deserve;<br>
But since you teach me how to flatter you,<br>
Imagine I have said farewell already.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lady Anne, Tressel,
and Berkeley</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, take up the corse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentlemen</p>
<p class="speech">Towards Chertsey, noble lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speech">Was ever woman in this humour woo&#8217;d?<br>
Was ever woman in this humour won?<br>
I&#8217;ll have her; but I will not keep her long.<br>
What! I, that kill&#8217;d her husband and his father,<br>
To take her in her heart&#8217;s extremest hate,<br>
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,<br>
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;<br>
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,<br>
And I nothing to back my suit at all,<br>
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,<br>
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!<br>
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,<br>
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,<br>
Stabb&#8217;d in my angry mood at Tewksbury?<br>
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,<br>
Framed in the prodigality of nature,<br>
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,<br>
The spacious world cannot again afford<br>
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,<br>
That cropp&#8217;d the golden prime of this sweet prince,<br>
And made her widow to a woful bed?<br>
On me, whose all not equals Edward&#8217;s moiety?<br>
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?<br>
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,<br>
I do mistake my person all this while:<br>
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,<br>
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.<br>
I&#8217;ll be at charges for a looking-glass,<br>
And entertain some score or two of tailors,<br>
To study fashions to adorn my body:<br>
Since I am crept in favour with myself,<br>
Will maintain it with some little cost.<br>
But first I&#8217;ll turn yon fellow in his grave;<br>
And then return lamenting to my love.<br>
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,<br>
That I may see my shadow as I pass.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Elizabeth,
Rivers, and Grey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, madam: there&#8217;s no doubt his
majesty<br>
Will soon recover his accustom&#8217;d health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:<br>
Therefore, for God&#8217;s sake, entertain good comfort,<br>
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">If he were dead, what would betide of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">No other harm but loss of such a lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The loss of such a lord includes all harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">The heavens have bless&#8217;d you with a goodly
son,<br>
To be your comforter when he is gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, he is young and his minority<br>
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,<br>
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">It is determined, not concluded yet:<br>
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Buckingham and
Derby</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Good time of day unto your royal grace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">God make your majesty joyful as you have
been!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.<br>
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.<br>
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she&#8217;s your wife,<br>
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured<br>
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">I do beseech you, either not believe<br>
The envious slanders of her false accusers;<br>
Or, if she be accused in true report,<br>
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds<br>
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?</p>
<p class="speaker">Derby</p>
<p class="speech">But now the Duke of Buckingham and I<br>
Are come from visiting his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, good hope; his grace speaks
cheerfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">God grant him health! Did you confer with
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement<br>
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,<br>
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;<br>
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Would all were well! but that will never be<br>
I fear our happiness is at the highest.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester, Hastings,
and Dorset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:<br>
Who are they that complain unto the king,<br>
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?<br>
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly<br>
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.<br>
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,<br>
Smile in men&#8217;s faces, smooth, deceive and cog,<br>
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,<br>
I must be held a rancorous enemy.<br>
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,<br>
But thus his simple truth must be abused<br>
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">To whom in all this presence speaks your
grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.<br>
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?<br>
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?<br>
A plague upon you all! His royal person,&#8212;<br>
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&#8212;<br>
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,<br>
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the
matter.<br>
The king, of his own royal disposition,<br>
And not provoked by any suitor else;<br>
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,<br>
Which in your outward actions shows itself<br>
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,<br>
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather<br>
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,<br>
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:<br>
Since every Jack became a gentleman<br>
There&#8217;s many a gentle person made a Jack.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, we know your meaning, brother<br>
Gloucester;<br>
You envy my advancement and my friends&#8217;:<br>
God grant we never may have need of you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Meantime, God grants that we have need of
you:<br>
Your brother is imprison&#8217;d by your means,<br>
Myself disgraced, and the nobility<br>
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions<br>
Are daily given to ennoble those<br>
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">By Him that raised me to this careful height<br>
From that contented hap which I enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
I never did incense his majesty<br>
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been<br>
An earnest advocate to plead for him.<br>
My lord, you do me shameful injury,<br>
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">You may deny that you were not the cause<br>
Of my Lord Hastings&#8217; late imprisonment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">She may, my lord, for&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?<br>
She may do more, sir, than denying that:<br>
She may help you to many fair preferments,<br>
And then deny her aiding hand therein,<br>
And lay those honours on your high deserts.<br>
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">What, marry, may she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What, marry, may she! marry with a king,<br>
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:<br>
I wis your grandam had a worser match.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne<br>
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:<br>
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty<br>
With those gross taunts I often have endured.<br>
I had rather be a country servant-maid<br>
Than a great queen, with this condition,<br>
To be thus taunted, scorn&#8217;d, and baited at:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret,
behind</span></p>
<p class="speech">Small joy have I in being England&#8217;s
queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And lessen&#8217;d be that small, God, I beseech
thee!<br>
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What! threat you me with telling of the king?<br>
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said<br>
I will avouch in presence of the king:<br>
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.<br>
&#8217;Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Out, devil! I remember them too well:<br>
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,<br>
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband
king,<br>
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;<br>
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,<br>
A liberal rewarder of his friends:<br>
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">In all which time you and your husband Grey<br>
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;<br>
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband<br>
In Margaret&#8217;s battle at Saint Alban&#8217;s slain?<br>
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,<br>
What you have been ere now, and what you are;<br>
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A murderous villain, and so still thou art.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Poor Clarence did forsake his father,
Warwick;<br>
Yea, and forswore himself,&#8212;which Jesu pardon!&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Which God revenge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">To fight on Edward&#8217;s party for the
crown;<br>
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew&#8217;d up.<br>
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward&#8217;s;<br>
Or Edward&#8217;s soft and pitiful, like mine<br>
I am too childish-foolish for this world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the
world,<br>
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days<br>
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,<br>
We follow&#8217;d then our lord, our lawful king:<br>
So should we you, if you should be our king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:<br>
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">As little joy, my lord, as you suppose<br>
You should enjoy, were you this country&#8217;s king,<br>
As little joy may you suppose in me.<br>
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;<br>
For I am she, and altogether joyless.<br>
I can no longer hold me patient.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Advancing</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out<br>
In sharing that which you have pill&#8217;d from me!<br>
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?<br>
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,<br>
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?<br>
O gentle villain, do not turn away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my
sight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">But repetition of what thou hast
marr&#8217;d;<br>
That will I make before I let thee go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I was; but I do find more pain in banishment<br>
Than death can yield me here by my abode.<br>
A husband and a son thou owest to me;<br>
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:<br>
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,<br>
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The curse my noble father laid on thee,<br>
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper<br>
And with thy scorns drew&#8217;st rivers from his eyes,<br>
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout<br>
Steep&#8217;d in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&#8212;<br>
His curses, then from bitterness of soul<br>
Denounced against thee, are all fall&#8217;n upon thee;<br>
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">So just is God, to right the innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;twas the foulest deed to slay that
babe,<br>
And the most merciless that e&#8217;er was heard of!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">No man but prophesied revenge for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What were you snarling all before I came,<br>
Ready to catch each other by the throat,<br>
And turn you all your hatred now on me?<br>
Did York&#8217;s dread curse prevail so much with heaven?<br>
That Henry&#8217;s death, my lovely Edward&#8217;s death,<br>
Their kingdom&#8217;s loss, my woful banishment,<br>
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?<br>
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?<br>
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!<br>
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,<br>
As ours by murder, to make him a king!<br>
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,<br>
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,<br>
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!<br>
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,<br>
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!<br>
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children&#8217;s loss;<br>
And see another, as I see thee now,<br>
Deck&#8217;d in thy rights, as thou art stall&#8217;d in mine!<br>
Long die thy happy days before thy death;<br>
And, after many lengthen&#8217;d hours of grief,<br>
Die neither mother, wife, nor England&#8217;s queen!<br>
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,<br>
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son<br>
Was stabb&#8217;d with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,<br>
That none of you may live your natural age,<br>
But by some unlook&#8217;d accident cut off!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

hag!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt
hear me.<br>
If heaven have any grievous plague in store<br>
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,<br>
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,<br>
And then hurl down their indignation<br>
On thee, the troubler of the poor world&#8217;s peace!<br>
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!<br>
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,<br>
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!<br>
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,<br>
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream<br>
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!<br>
Thou elvish-mark&#8217;d, abortive, rooting hog!<br>
Thou that wast seal&#8217;d in thy nativity<br>
The slave of nature and the son of hell!<br>
Thou slander of thy mother&#8217;s heavy womb!<br>
Thou loathed issue of thy father&#8217;s loins!<br>
Thou rag of honour! thou detested&#8212;</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I call thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought<br>
That thou hadst call&#8217;d me all these bitter names.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I did; but look&#8217;d for no reply.<br>
O, let me make the period to my curse!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis done by me, and ends in
&#8216;Margaret.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Thus have you breathed your curse against
yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my
fortune!<br>
Why strew&#8217;st thou sugar on that bottled spider,<br>
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?<br>
Fool, fool! thou whet&#8217;st a knife to kill thyself.<br>
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me<br>
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback&#8217;d toad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,<br>
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">Were you well served, you would be taught your
duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">To serve me well, you all should do me duty,<br>
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:<br>
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:<br>
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.<br>
O, that your young nobility could judge<br>
What &#8217;twere to lose it, and be miserable!<br>
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;<br>
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it,
marquess.</p>
<p class="speaker">Dorset</p>
<p class="speech">It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,<br>
Our aery buildeth in the cedar&#8217;s top,<br>
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!<br>
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;<br>
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath<br>
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.<br>
Your aery buildeth in our aery&#8217;s nest.<br>
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!<br>
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Have done! for shame, if not for charity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Urge neither charity nor shame to me:<br>
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,<br>
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher&#8217;d.<br>
My charity is outrage, life my shame<br>
And in that shame still live my sorrow&#8217;s rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Have done, have done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">O princely Buckingham I&#8217;ll kiss thy
hand,<br>
In sign of league and amity with thee:<br>
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!<br>
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,<br>
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Nor no one here; for curses never pass<br>
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not believe but they ascend the
sky,<br>
And there awake God&#8217;s gentle-sleeping peace.<br>
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!<br>
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,<br>
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:<br>
Have not to do with him, beware of him;<br>
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,<br>
And all their ministers attend on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle
counsel?<br>
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?<br>
O, but remember this another day,<br>
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,<br>
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!<br>
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,<br>
And he to yours, and all of you to God&#8217;s!</p>

<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">And so doth mine: I muse why she&#8217;s at
liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot blame her: by God&#8217;s holy
mother,<br>
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent<br>
My part thereof that I have done to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">I never did her any, to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But you have all the vantage of her wrong.<br>
I was too hot to do somebody good,<br>
That is too cold in thinking of it now.<br>
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,<br>
He is frank&#8217;d up to fatting for his pains<br>
God pardon them that are the cause of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Rivers</p>
<p class="speech">A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,<br>

<p class="speech">I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.<br>
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach<br>
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.<br>
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,<br>
I do beweep to many simple gulls<br>
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;<br>
And say it is the queen and her allies<br>
That stir the king against the duke my brother.<br>
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me<br>
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:<br>
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,<br>
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:<br>
And thus I clothe my naked villany<br>
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;<br>
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.</p>

Are you now going to dispatch this deed?</p>

<p class="speech">We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant<br>
That we may be admitted where he is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well thought upon; I have it here about me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gives the warrant</span></p>
<p class="speech">When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.<br>
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,<br>
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;<br>
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps<br>
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Tush!<br>
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;<br>
Talkers are no good doers: be assured<br>
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your eyes drop millstones, when fools&#8217; eyes
drop tears:<br>
I like you, lads; about your business straight;<br>

<h4>Scene IV. London. The Tower.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clarence and
Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Why looks your grace so heavily today?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, I have pass&#8217;d a miserable night,<br>
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,<br>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,<br>
I would not spend another such a night,<br>
Though &#8217;twere to buy a world of happy days,<br>
So full of dismal terror was the time!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">What was your dream? I long to hear you tell
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,<br>
And was embark&#8217;d to cross to Burgundy;<br>
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;<br>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk<br>
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,<br>
And cited up a thousand fearful times,<br>
During the wars of York and Lancaster<br>
That had befall&#8217;n us. As we paced along<br>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,<br>
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,<br>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,<br>
Into the tumbling billows of the main.<br>
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!<br>
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!<br>
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!<br>
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;<br>
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw&#8217;d upon;<br>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,<br>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<br>
All scatter&#8217;d in the bottom of the sea:<br>
Some lay in dead men&#8217;s skulls; and, in those holes<br>
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,<br>
As &#8217;twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,<br>
Which woo&#8217;d the slimy bottom of the deep,<br>
And mock&#8217;d the dead bones that lay scatter&#8217;d by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Had you such leisure in the time of death<br>
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Methought I had; and often did I strive<br>
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood<br>
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth<br>
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;<br>
But smother&#8217;d it within my panting bulk,<br>
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Awaked you not with this sore agony?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, my dream was lengthen&#8217;d after
life;<br>
O, then began the tempest to my soul,<br>
Who pass&#8217;d, methought, the melancholy flood,<br>
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,<br>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.<br>
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,<br>
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;<br>
Who cried aloud, &#8216;What scourge for perjury<br>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?&#8217;<br>
And so he vanish&#8217;d: then came wandering by<br>
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair<br>
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak&#8217;d out aloud,<br>
&#8216;Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,<br>
That stabb&#8217;d me in the field by Tewksbury;<br>
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!&#8217;<br>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends<br>
Environ&#8217;d me about, and howled in mine ears<br>
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise<br>
I trembling waked, and for a season after<br>
Could not believe but that I was in hell,<br>
Such terrible impression made the dream.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;<br>
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O Brakenbury, I have done those things,<br>
Which now bear evidence against my soul,<br>
For Edward&#8217;s sake; and see how he requites me!<br>
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,<br>
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,<br>
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,<br>
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!<br>
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;<br>
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my lord: God give your grace good
rest!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Clarence sleeps</span></p>
<p class="speech">Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,<br>
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.<br>
Princes have but their tides for their glories,<br>
An outward honour for an inward toil;<br>
And, for unfelt imagination,<br>
They often feel a world of restless cares:<br>
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,<br>
There&#8217;s nothing differs but the outward fame.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the two
Murderers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Ho! who&#8217;s here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name what are you, and how came
you hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on
my legs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">Yea, are you so brief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious.
Show
him our commission; talk no more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Brakenbury reads
it</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brakenbury</p>
<p class="speech">I am, in this, commanded to deliver<br>
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:<br>
I will not reason what is meant hereby,<br>
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.<br>
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:<br>
I&#8217;ll to the king; and signify to him<br>
That thus I have resign&#8217;d my charge to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you
well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Brakenbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">No; then he will say &#8217;twas done cowardly,
when he wakes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake
till
the judgment-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then he will say we stabbed him
sleeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">The urging of that word &#8216;judgment&#8217;
hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou afraid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to
be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I thought thou hadst been resolute.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">So I am, to let him live.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy
humour
will change; &#8217;twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou feel thyself now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, some certain dregs of conscience
are yet
within me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Remember our reward, when the deed is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the
reward.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Where is thy conscience now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">In the Duke of Gloucester&#8217;s purse.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">So when he opens his purse to give us our
reward,
thy conscience flies out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Let it go; there&#8217;s few or none will
entertain it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How if it come to thee again?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous
thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour&#8217;s wife, but it
detects him: &#8217;tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man&#8217;s bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Zounds, it is even now at my elbow,
persuading me
not to kill the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not:
he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with
me,<br>
I warrant thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Take him over the costard with the hilts of
thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent devise! make a sop of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">No, first let&#8217;s reason with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of
wine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second murderer</p>
<p class="speech">You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, what art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">A man, as you are.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">But not, as I am, royal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Nor you, as we are, loyal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are
humble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">My voice is now the king&#8217;s, my looks mine
own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!<br>
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?<br>
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">To, to, to&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">To murder me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,<br>
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.<br>
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Offended us you have not, but the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">I shall be reconciled to him again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Are you call&#8217;d forth from out a world of
men<br>
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?<br>
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?<br>
What lawful quest have given their verdict up<br>
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced<br>
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence&#8217; death?<br>
Before I be convict by course of law,<br>
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.<br>
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption<br>
By Christ&#8217;s dear blood shed for our grievous sins,<br>
That you depart and lay no hands on me<br>
The deed you undertake is damnable.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What we will do, we do upon command.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And he that hath commanded is the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings<br>
Hath in the tables of his law commanded<br>
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,<br>
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man&#8217;s?<br>
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,<br>
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,<br>
For false forswearing and for murder too:<br>
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,<br>
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">And, like a traitor to the name of God,<br>
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade<br>
Unrip&#8217;dst the bowels of thy sovereign&#8217;s son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou urge God&#8217;s dreadful law to
us,<br>
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?<br>
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,<br>
He sends ye not to murder me for this<br>
For in this sin he is as deep as I.<br>
If God will be revenged for this deed.<br>
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,<br>
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;<br>
He needs no indirect nor lawless course<br>
To cut off those that have offended him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,<br>
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,<br>
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">My brother&#8217;s love, the devil, and my
rage.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Thy brother&#8217;s love, our duty, and thy
fault,<br>
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;<br>
I am his brother, and I love him well.<br>
If you be hired for meed, go back again,<br>
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,<br>
Who shall reward you better for my life<br>
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:<br>
Go you to him from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so we will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him, when that our princely father York<br>
Bless&#8217;d his three sons with his victorious arm,<br>
And charged us from his soul to love each other,<br>
He little thought of this divided friendship:<br>
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, millstones; as be lesson&#8217;d us to
weep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not slander him, for he is kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Right,<br>
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:<br>
&#8217;Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">It cannot be; for when I parted with him,<br>
He hugg&#8217;d me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,<br>
That he would labour my delivery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee<br>
From this world&#8217;s thraldom to the joys of heaven.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Make peace with God, for you must die, my
lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,<br>
To counsel me to make my peace with God,<br>
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,<br>
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?<br>
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on<br>
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">What shall we do?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Relent, and save your souls.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Relent! &#8217;tis cowardly and womanish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.<br>
Which of you, if you were a prince&#8217;s son,<br>
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,<br>
If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,<br>
Would not entreat for life?<br>
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:<br>
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,<br>
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,<br>
As you would beg, were you in my distress<br>
A begging prince what beggar pities not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Look behind you, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">Take that, and that: if all this will not do,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabs him</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll drown you in the malmsey-butt
within.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit, with the
body</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">A bloody deed, and desperately
dispatch&#8217;d!<br>
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands<br>
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter First
Murderer</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">How now! what mean&#8217;st thou, that thou
help&#8217;st me not?<br>
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">I would he knew that I had saved his brother!<br>
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;<br>
For I repent me that the duke is slain.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Murderer</p>
<p class="speech">So do not I: go, coward as thou art.<br>
Now must I hide his body in some hole,<br>
Until the duke take order for his burial:<br>
And when I have my meed, I must away;<br>
For this will out, and here I must not stay.</p>

Amongst this princely heap, if any here,<br>
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,<br>
Hold me a foe;<br>
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,<br>
Have aught committed that is hardly borne<br>
By any in this presence, I desire<br>
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:<br>
&#8217;Tis death to me to be at enmity;<br>
I hate it, and desire all good men&#8217;s love.<br>
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,<br>
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;<br>
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,<br>
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;<br>
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;<br>
That without desert have frown&#8217;d on me;<br>
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.<br>

That came too lag to see him buried.<br>
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,<br>

Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>

death,<br>
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?<br>
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,<br>
And yet his punishment was cruel death.<br>
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,<br>
Kneel&#8217;d at my feet, and bade me be advised<br>
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?<br>
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake<br>
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?<br>
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury<br>
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,<br>
And said, &#8216;Dear brother, live, and be a king&#8217;?<br>
Who told me, when we both lay in the field<br>
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me<br>
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,<br>
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?<br>
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath<br>
Sinfully pluck&#8217;d, and not a man of you<br>
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.<br>
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals<br>
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced<br>
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,<br>
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;<br>
And I unjustly too, must grant it you<br>
But for my brother not a man would speak,<br>
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself<br>
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all<br>
Have been beholding to him in his life;<br>
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.<br>
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold<br>
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!<br>
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.<br>
Oh, poor Clarence!</p>

And cry &#8216;O Clarence, my unhappy son!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Girl</p>

If that our noble father be alive?</p>

<p class="speech">My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;<br>
I do lament the sickness of the king.<br>
As loath to lose him, not your father&#8217;s death;<br>
It were lost sorrow to wail one that&#8217;s lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Boy</p>
<p class="speech">Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.<br>

God will revenge it; whom I will importune<br>

And when my uncle told me so, he wept,<br>

Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,<br>

<p class="speech">In him there is a hope of government,<br>

For then this land was famously enrich&#8217;d<br>

O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!<br>

Ye cannot reason almost with a man<br>

Hath almost overta&#8217;en him in his growth.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,<br>
My uncle Rivers talk&#8217;d how I did grow<br>
More than my brother: &#8216;Ay,&#8217; quoth my uncle<br>
Gloucester,<br>
&#8216;small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow
apace:&#8217;<br>
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,<br>
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Good faith, good faith, the saying did not
hold<br>
In him that did object the same to thee;<br>
He was the wretched&#8217;st thing when he was young,<br>
So long a-growing and so leisurely,<br>
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Archbishop Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.</p>

<p class="speech">Now, by my troth, if I had been

I could have given my uncle&#8217;s grace a flout,<br>

<p class="speech">How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>

That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old<br>
&#8217;Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.<br>
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>

Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!<br>
I see, as in a map, the end of all.</p>

My husband lost his life to get the crown;<br>
And often up and down my sons were toss&#8217;d,<br>
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:<br>
And being seated, and domestic broils<br>
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.<br>
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,<br>
Self against self: O, preposterous<br>
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;<br>
Or let me die, to look on death no more!</p>

sovereign<br>
The weary way hath made you melancholy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">No, uncle; but our crosses on the way<br>
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy<br>
I want more uncles here to welcome me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your
years<br>
Hath not yet dived into the world&#8217;s deceit<br>
Nor more can you distinguish of a man<br>
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,<br>
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.<br>
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<br>
Your grace attended to their sugar&#8217;d words,<br>
But look&#8217;d not on the poison of their hearts :<br>
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!</p>

I thought my mother, and my brother York,<br>

Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not<br>

<p class="speech">On what occasion, God he knows, not I,<br>
The queen your mother, and your brother York,<br>
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince<br>
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,<br>
But by his mother was perforce withheld.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, what an indirect and peevish course<br>
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace<br>
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York<br>
Unto his princely brother presently?<br>
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,<br>
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory<br>
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,<br>
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate<br>
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid<br>
We should infringe the holy privilege<br>
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land<br>
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">You are too senseless&#8212;obstinate, my
lord,<br>
Too ceremonious and traditional<br>
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,<br>
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.<br>
The benefit thereof is always granted<br>
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,<br>
And those who have the wit to claim the place:<br>
This prince hath neither claim&#8217;d it nor deserved it;<br>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:<br>
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,<br>
You break no privilege nor charter there.<br>
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;<br>
But sanctuary children ne&#8217;er till now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you shall o&#8217;er-rule my mind for
once.<br>
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>

<p class="speech">You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:<br>
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;<br>
Because that I am little, like an ape,<br>

Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:<br>
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,<br>
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,<br>
And give us notice of his inclination:<br>
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,<br>
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ&#8217;d.</p>

His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries<br>

Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:<br>
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me<br>
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables<br>
Whereof the king my brother stood possess&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll claim that promise at your

Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards<br>

<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">So it should seem by that I have to say.<br>
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">And then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">And then he sends you word<br>
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:<br>
Besides, he says there are two councils held;<br>
And that may be determined at the one<br>
Which may make you and him to rue at the other.<br>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship&#8217;s pleasure,<br>
If presently you will take horse with him,<br>
And with all speed post with him toward the north,<br>
To shun the danger that his soul divines.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;<br>
Bid him not fear the separated councils<br>
His honour and myself are at the one,<br>
And at the other is my servant Catesby<br>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us<br>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.<br>
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:<br>
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond<br>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers<br>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,<br>
Were to incense the boar to follow us<br>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<br>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me<br>
And we will both together to the Tower,<br>
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.</p>

<p class="speech">Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring<br>
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;<br>
And I believe twill never stand upright<br>
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the
crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have this crown of mine cut from my
shoulders<br>
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.<br>
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward<br>
Upon his party for the gain thereof:<br>
And thereupon he sends you this good news,<br>
That this same very day your enemies,<br>
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,<br>
Because they have been still mine enemies:<br>
But, that I&#8217;ll give my voice on Richard&#8217;s side,<br>
To bar my master&#8217;s heirs in true descent,<br>
God knows I will not do it, to the death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>
<p class="speech">But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month
hence,<br>
That they who brought me in my master&#8217;s hate<br>
I live to look upon their tragedy.<br>
I tell thee, Catesby&#8212;</p>

With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so &#8217;twill do<br>
With some men else, who think themselves as safe<br>
As thou and I; who, as thou know&#8217;st, are dear<br>

You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,<br>
I do not like these several councils, I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hastings</p>

I hold my life as dear as you do yours;<br>
And never in my life, I do protest,<br>
Was it more precious to me than &#8217;tis now:<br>

I would be so triumphant as I am?</p>
<p class="speaker">Stanley</p>

Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!<br>
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.</p>

By the suggestion of the queen&#8217;s allies;<br>
But now, I tell thee&#8212;keep it to thyself&#8212;<br>

I mean, his conversation with Shore&#8217;s wife,<br>
He lived from all attainder of suspect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Well, well, he was the covert&#8217;st
shelter&#8217;d traitor<br>
That ever lived.<br>
Would you imagine, or almost believe,<br>
Were&#8217;t not that, by great preservation,<br>
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor<br>
This day had plotted, in the council-house<br>
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">What, had he so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What, think You we are Turks or infidels?<br>
Or that we would, against the form of law,<br>
Proceed thus rashly to the villain&#8217;s death,<br>
But that the extreme peril of the case,<br>
The peace of England and our persons&#8217; safety,<br>
Enforced us to this execution?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;<br>
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,<br>
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.<br>
I never look&#8217;d for better at his hands,<br>
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Yet had not we determined he should die,<br>
Until your lordship came to see his death;<br>
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,<br>
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:<br>
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard<br>
The traitor speak, and timorously confess<br>
The manner and the purpose of his treason;<br>
That you might well have signified the same<br>
Unto the citizens, who haply may<br>
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">But, my good lord, your grace&#8217;s word shall
serve,<br>
As well as I had seen and heard him speak<br>
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,<br>
But I&#8217;ll acquaint our duteous citizens<br>
With all your just proceedings in this cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

here,<br>
To avoid the carping censures of the world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">But since you come too late of our intents,<br>
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:<br>
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.</p>

The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:<br>
There, at your meet&#8217;st advantage of the time,<br>
Infer the bastardy of Edward&#8217;s children:<br>
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,<br>
Only for saying he would make his son<br>
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,<br>
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.<br>
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury<br>
And bestial appetite in change of lust;<br>
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,<br>
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,<br>
Without control, listed to make his prey.<br>
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:<br>
Tell them, when that my mother went with child<br>
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York<br>
My princely father then had wars in France<br>
And, by just computation of the time,<br>
Found that the issue was not his begot;<br>
Which well appeared in his lineaments,<br>
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:<br>
But touch this sparingly, as &#8217;twere far off,<br>
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>

Eleven hours I spent to write it over,<br>
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;<br>
The precedent was full as long a-doing:<br>
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,<br>
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty<br>
Here&#8217;s a good world the while! Why who&#8217;s so gross,<br>
That seeth not this palpable device?<br>

<p class="speech">Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,<br>
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.</p>

<p class="speech">Touch&#8217;d you the bastardy of Edward&#8217;s
children?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,<br>
And his contract by deputy in France;<br>
The insatiate greediness of his desires,<br>
And his enforcement of the city wives;<br>
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,<br>
As being got, your father then in France,<br>
His resemblance, being not like the duke;<br>
Withal I did infer your lineaments,<br>
Being the right idea of your father,<br>
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;<br>
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,<br>
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,<br>
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:<br>
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose<br>
Untouch&#8217;d, or slightly handled, in discourse<br>
And when mine oratory grew to an end<br>
I bid them that did love their country&#8217;s good<br>
Cry &#8216;God save Richard, England&#8217;s royal king!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ah! and did they so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">No, so God help me, they spake not a word;<br>
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,<br>
Gazed each on other, and look&#8217;d deadly pale.<br>
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;<br>
And ask&#8217;d the mayor what meant this wilful silence:<br>
His answer was, the people were not wont<br>
To be spoke to but by the recorder.<br>
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,<br>
&#8216;Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke
inferr&#8217;d;&#8217;<br>
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.<br>
When he had done, some followers of mine own,<br>
At the lower end of the hall, hurl&#8217;d up their caps,<br>
And some ten voices cried &#8216;God save King Richard!&#8217;<br>
And thus I took the vantage of those few,<br>
&#8216;Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,&#8217; quoth I;<br>
&#8216;This general applause and loving shout<br>
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:&#8217;<br>

Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:<br>
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,<br>
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;<br>
For on that ground I&#8217;ll build a holy descant:<br>
And be not easily won to our request:<br>
Play the maid&#8217;s part, still answer nay, and take it.</p>

He is within, with two right reverend fathers,<br>

To draw him from his holy exercise.</p>

In deep designs and matters of great moment,<br>

He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,<br>
But on his knees at meditation;<br>
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,<br>
But meditating with two deep divines;<br>
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,<br>
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:<br>
Happy were England, would this gracious prince<br>
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:<br>
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne&#8217;er win him to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, God forbid his grace should say us
nay!</p>

He wonders to what end you have assembled<br>
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,<br>
His grace not being warn&#8217;d thereof before:<br>
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Sorry I am my noble cousin should<br>
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:<br>
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;<br>
And so once more return and tell his grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Catesby</span></p>

Lend favourable ears to our request;<br>
And pardon us the interruption<br>
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, there needs no such apology:<br>
I rather do beseech you pardon me,<br>
Who, earnest in the service of my God,<br>
Neglect the visitation of my friends.<br>
But, leaving this, what is your grace&#8217;s pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,<br>
And all good men of this ungovern&#8217;d isle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I do suspect I have done some offence<br>
That seems disgracious in the city&#8217;s eyes,<br>
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">You have, my lord: would it might please your
grace,<br>
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Then know, it is your fault that you resign<br>
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,<br>
The scepter&#8217;d office of your ancestors,<br>
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,<br>
The lineal glory of your royal house,<br>
To the corruption of a blemished stock:<br>
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,<br>
Which here we waken to our country&#8217;s good,<br>
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;<br>
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,<br>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,<br>
And almost shoulder&#8217;d in the swallowing gulf<br>
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.<br>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit<br>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge<br>
And kingly government of this your land,<br>
Not as protector, steward, substitute,<br>
Or lowly factor for another&#8217;s gain;<br>
But as successively from blood to blood,<br>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.<br>
For this, consorted with the citizens,<br>
Your very worshipful and loving friends,<br>
And by their vehement instigation,<br>
In this just suit come I to move your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know not whether to depart in silence,<br>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.<br>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition<br>
If not to answer, you might haply think<br>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded<br>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,<br>
Which fondly you would here impose on me;<br>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,<br>
So season&#8217;d with your faithful love to me.<br>
Then, on the other side, I cheque&#8217;d my friends.<br>
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,<br>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,<br>
Definitively thus I answer you.<br>
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert<br>
Unmeritable shuns your high request.<br>
First if all obstacles were cut away,<br>
And that my path were even to the crown,<br>
As my ripe revenue and due by birth<br>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,<br>
So mighty and so many my defects,<br>
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,<br>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,<br>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,<br>
And in the vapour of my glory smother&#8217;d.<br>
But, God be thank&#8217;d, there&#8217;s no need of me,<br>
And much I need to help you, if need were;<br>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,<br>
Which, mellow&#8217;d by the stealing hours of time,<br>
Will well become the seat of majesty,<br>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.<br>
On him I lay what you would lay on me,<br>
The right and fortune of his happy stars;<br>
Which God defend that I should wring from him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, this argues conscience in your
grace;<br>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,<br>
All circumstances well considered.<br>
You say that Edward is your brother&#8217;s son:<br>
So say we too, but not by Edward&#8217;s wife;<br>
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy&#8212;<br>
Your mother lives a witness to that vow&#8212;<br>
And afterward by substitute betroth&#8217;d<br>
To Bona, sister to the King of France.<br>
These both put by a poor petitioner,<br>
A care-crazed mother of a many children,<br>
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,<br>
Even in the afternoon of her best days,<br>
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,<br>
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts<br>
To base declension and loathed bigamy<br>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got<br>
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.<br>
More bitterly could I expostulate,<br>
Save that, for reverence to some alive,<br>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.<br>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<br>
This proffer&#8217;d benefit of dignity;<br>
If non to bless us and the land withal,<br>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry<br>
From the corruption of abusing times,<br>
Unto a lineal true-derived course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>

love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Catesby</p>
<p class="speech">O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?<br>
I am unfit for state and majesty;<br>
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;<br>
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">If you refuse it,&#8212;as, in love and zeal,<br>
Loath to depose the child, Your brother&#8217;s son;<br>
As well we know your tenderness of heart<br>
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,<br>
Which we have noted in you to your kin,<br>
And egally indeed to all estates,&#8212;<br>
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,<br>
Your brother&#8217;s son shall never reign our king;<br>
But we will plant some other in the throne,<br>
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:<br>
And in this resolution here we leave you.&#8212;<br>
Come, citizens: &#8217;zounds! I&#8217;ll entreat no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Buckingham with the

<p class="speaker">Another</p>
<p class="speech">Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Would you enforce me to a world of care?<br>
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,<br>
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,<br>
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Buckingham and the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speech">Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave
men,<br>
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,<br>
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,<br>
I must have patience to endure the load:<br>
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach<br>
Attend the sequel of your imposition,<br>
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me<br>
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;<br>
For God he knows, and you may partly see,<br>
How far I am from the desire thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>
<p class="speech">God bless your grace! we see it, and will say
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">In saying so, you shall but say the truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Then I salute you with this kingly title:<br>
Long live Richard, England&#8217;s royal king!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Mayor</p>

<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>

<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!<br>
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;<br>
Thy mother&#8217;s name is ominous to children.<br>
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,<br>
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell<br>
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,<br>
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;<br>

<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>
<p class="speech">And I in all unwillingness will go.<br>
I would to God that the inclusive verge<br>
Of golden metal that must round my brow<br>
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!<br>
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,<br>
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!</p>

Came to me, as I follow&#8217;d Henry&#8217;s corse,<br>
When scarce the blood was well wash&#8217;d from his hands<br>
Which issued from my other angel husband<br>
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow&#8217;d;<br>
O, when, I say, I look&#8217;d on Richard&#8217;s face,<br>
This was my wish: &#8216;Be thou,&#8217; quoth I, &#8216;accursed,<br>
For making me, so young, so old a widow!<br>
And, when thou wed&#8217;st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;<br>
And be thy wife&#8212;if any be so mad&#8212;<br>
As miserable by the life of thee<br>
As thou hast made me by my dear lord&#8217;s death!<br>
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,<br>
Even in so short a space, my woman&#8217;s heart<br>
Grossly grew captive to his honey words<br>
And proved the subject of my own soul&#8217;s curse,<br>
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;<br>
For never yet one hour in his bed<br>
Have I enjoy&#8217;d the golden dew of sleep,<br>
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.<br>
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;<br>
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Anne</p>

Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes<br>

For tender princes, use my babies well!<br>
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.</p>

That I may live to say, The dog is dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou didst prophesy the time would come<br>
That I should wish for thee to help me curse<br>
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back&#8217;d toad!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I call&#8217;d thee then vain flourish of my
fortune;<br>
I call&#8217;d thee then poor shadow, painted queen;<br>
The presentation of but what I was;<br>
The flattering index of a direful pageant;<br>
One heaved a-high, to be hurl&#8217;d down below;<br>
A mother only mock&#8217;d with two sweet babes;<br>
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,<br>
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,<br>
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,<br>
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.<br>
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?<br>
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?<br>
Who sues to thee and cries &#8216;God save the queen&#8217;?<br>
Where be the bending peers that flatter&#8217;d thee?<br>
Where be the thronging troops that follow&#8217;d thee?<br>
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:<br>
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;<br>
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;<br>
For queen, a very caitiff crown&#8217;d with care;<br>
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;<br>
For one that scorn&#8217;d at me, now scorn&#8217;d of me;<br>
For one being fear&#8217;d of all, now fearing one;<br>
For one commanding all, obey&#8217;d of none.<br>
Thus hath the course of justice wheel&#8217;d about,<br>
And left thee but a very prey to time;<br>
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,<br>
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.<br>
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not<br>
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?<br>
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen&#8217;d yoke;<br>
From which even here I slip my weary neck,<br>
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.<br>
Farewell, York&#8217;s wife, and queen of sad mischance:<br>
These English woes will make me smile in France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O thou well skill&#8217;d in curses, stay
awhile,<br>
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the
days;<br>
Compare dead happiness with living woe;<br>
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,<br>
And he that slew them fouler than he is:<br>
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:<br>
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My words are dull; O, quicken them with
thine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>

mine.</p>

Let them have scope: though what they do impart<br>
Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.<br>
And in the breath of bitter words let&#8217;s smother<br>

From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Hidest thou that forehead with a golden

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do then: but I&#8217;ll not

<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">I will be mild and gentle in my speech.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>

God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">And came I not at last to comfort you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duchess Of York</p>
<p class="speech">No, by the holy rood, thou know&#8217;st it well,<br>
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.<br>
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;<br>
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;<br>
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,<br>
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,<br>
Thy age confirm&#8217;d, proud, subdued, bloody, treacherous,<br>
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:<br>
What comfortable hour canst thou name,<br>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that

Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,<br>
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish<br>
And never look upon thy face again.<br>
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;<br>
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more<br>
Than all the complete armour that thou wear&#8217;st!<br>
My prayers on the adverse party fight;<br>
And there the little souls of Edward&#8217;s children<br>

<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">I have no more sons of the royal blood<br>
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,<br>
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;<br>
And therefore level not to hit their lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">You have a daughter call&#8217;d Elizabeth,<br>
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And must she die for this? O, let her live,<br>
And I&#8217;ll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;<br>
Slander myself as false to Edward&#8217;s bed;<br>
Throw over her the veil of infamy:<br>
So she may live unscarr&#8217;d of bleeding slaughter,<br>
I will confess she was not Edward&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">To save her life, I&#8217;ll say she is not
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Her life is only safest in her birth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And only in that safety died her brothers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">All unavoided is the doom of destiny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">True, when avoided grace makes destiny:<br>
My babes were destined to a fairer death,<br>
If grace had bless&#8217;d thee with a fairer life.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle
cozen&#8217;d<br>
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.<br>
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,<br>
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:<br>
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt<br>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,<br>
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.<br>
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,<br>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys<br>
Till that my nails were anchor&#8217;d in thine eyes;<br>
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,<br>
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,<br>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise<br>
And dangerous success of bloody wars,<br>
As I intend more good to you and yours,<br>
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What good is cover&#8217;d with the face of
heaven,<br>
To be discover&#8217;d, that can do me good?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">The advancement of your children, gentle
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Up to some scaffold, there to lose their
heads?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">No, to the dignity and height of honour<br>
The high imperial type of this earth&#8217;s glory.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Flatter my sorrows with report of it;<br>
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,<br>
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,<br>
Will I withal endow a child of thine;<br>
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul<br>
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs<br>
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Be brief, lest that be process of thy
kindness<br>
Last longer telling than thy kindness&#8217; date.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then know, that from my soul I love thy
daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter&#8217;s mother thinks it with her
soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">What do you think?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That thou dost love my daughter from thy
soul:<br>
So from thy soul&#8217;s love didst thou love her brothers;<br>
And from my heart&#8217;s love I do thank thee for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:<br>
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,<br>
And mean to make her queen of England.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her
king?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Even he that makes her queen who should be
else?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What, thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">I, even I: what think you of it, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou woo her?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">That would I learn of you,<br>
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">And wilt thou learn of me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Send to her, by the man that slew her
brothers,<br>
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave<br>
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:<br>
Therefore present to her&#8212;as sometime Margaret<br>
Did to thy father, steep&#8217;d in Rutland&#8217;s
blood,&#8212;<br>
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain<br>
The purple sap from her sweet brother&#8217;s body<br>
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.<br>
If this inducement force her not to love,<br>
Send her a story of thy noble acts;<br>
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,<br>
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,<br>
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way<br>
To win our daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">There is no other way<br>
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,<br>
And not be Richard that hath done all this.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say that I did all this for love of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate
thee,<br>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Look, what is done cannot be now amended:<br>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,<br>
Which after hours give leisure to repent.<br>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<br>
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.<br>
If I have kill&#8217;d the issue of your womb,<br>
To quicken your increase, I will beget<br>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter<br>
A grandam&#8217;s name is little less in love<br>
Than is the doting title of a mother;<br>
They are as children but one step below,<br>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;<br>
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans<br>
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.<br>
Your children were vexation to your youth,<br>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.<br>
The loss you have is but a son being king,<br>
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.<br>
I cannot make you what amends I would,<br>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.<br>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul<br>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,<br>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home<br>
To high promotions and great dignity:<br>
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.<br>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;<br>
Again shall you be mother to a king,<br>
And all the ruins of distressful times<br>
Repair&#8217;d with double riches of content.<br>
What! we have many goodly days to see:<br>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<br>
Shall come again, transform&#8217;d to orient pearl,<br>
Advantaging their loan with interest<br>
Of ten times double gain of happiness.<br>
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go<br>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;<br>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer&#8217;s tale<br>
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame<br>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess<br>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys<br>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised<br>
The petty rebel, dull-brain&#8217;d Buckingham,<br>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come<br>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror&#8217;s bed;<br>
To whom I will retail my conquest won,<br>
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar&#8217;s Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">What were I best to say? her father&#8217;s
brother<br>
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?<br>
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?<br>
Under what title shall I woo for thee,<br>
That God, the law, my honour and her love,<br>
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Infer fair England&#8217;s peace by this
alliance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Which she shall purchase with still lasting
war.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say that the king, which may command,
entreats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That at her hands which the king&#8217;s King
forbids.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">To wail the tide, as her mother doth.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, I will love her everlastingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But how long shall that title &#8216;ever&#8217;
last?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Sweetly in force unto her fair life&#8217;s
end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">So long as hell and Richard likes of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But she, your subject, loathes such
sovereignty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Be eloquent in my behalf to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">An honest tale speeds best being plainly
told.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;<br>
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings
break.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my George, my garter, and my
crown,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Profaned, dishonour&#8217;d, and the third

The garter, blemish&#8217;d, pawn&#8217;d his knightly virtue;<br>
The crown, usurp&#8217;d, disgraced his kingly glory.<br>
If something thou wilt swear to be believed,<br>
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by the world&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>

<p class="speech">Then, by myself&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thyself thyself misusest.</p>

<p class="speech">Why then, by God&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;God&#8217;s wrong is most of
all.<br>
If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by Him,<br>
The unity the king thy brother made<br>
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:<br>
If thou hadst fear&#8217;d to break an oath by Him,<br>
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,<br>
Had graced the tender temples of my child,<br>
And both the princes had been breathing here,<br>
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,<br>
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.<br>
What canst thou swear by now?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">The time to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">That thou hast wronged in the time
o&#8217;erpast;<br>
For I myself have many tears to wash<br>
Hereafter time, for time past wrong&#8217;d by thee.<br>
The children live, whose parents thou hast
slaughter&#8217;d,<br>
Ungovern&#8217;d youth, to wail it in their age;<br>
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher&#8217;d,<br>
Old wither&#8217;d plants, to wail it with their age.<br>
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast<br>
Misused ere used, by time misused o&#8217;erpast.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">As I intend to prosper and repent,<br>
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt<br>
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!<br>
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!<br>
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!<br>
Be opposite all planets of good luck<br>
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart&#8217;s love,<br>
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,<br>
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!<br>
In her consists my happiness and thine;<br>
Without her, follows to this land and me,<br>
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,<br>
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:<br>
It cannot be avoided but by this;<br>
It will not be avoided but by this.<br>
Therefore, good mother,&#8212;I must can you so&#8212;<br>
Be the attorney of my love to her:<br>
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;<br>
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:<br>
Urge the necessity and state of times,<br>
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I forget myself to be myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if yourself&#8217;s remembrance wrong
yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elizabeth</p>
<p class="speech">But thou didst kill my children.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard III</p>
<p class="speech">But in your daughter&#8217;s womb I bury

Like high-rear&#8217;d bulwarks, stand before our faces;<br>
Richard except, those whom we fight against<br>
Had rather have us win than him they follow:<br>
For what is he they follow? truly, gentlemen,<br>
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;<br>
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish&#8217;d;<br>
One that made means to come by what he hath,<br>
And slaughter&#8217;d those that were the means to help him;<br>
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil<br>
Of England&#8217;s chair, where he is falsely set;<br>
One that hath ever been God&#8217;s enemy:<br>
Then, if you fight against God&#8217;s enemy,<br>
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;<br>
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,<br>
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;<br>
If you do fight against your country&#8217;s foes,<br>
Your country&#8217;s fat shall pay your pains the hire;<br>
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,<br>
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;<br>
If you do free your children from the sword,<br>
Your children&#8217;s children quit it in your age.<br>
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,<br>
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.<br>
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt<br>
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth&#8217;s cold face;<br>
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt<br>
The least of you shall share his part thereof.<br>
