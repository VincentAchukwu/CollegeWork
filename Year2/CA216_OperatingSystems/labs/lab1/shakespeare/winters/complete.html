<h4>Scene I. Antechamber in Leontes&#8217; palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Camillo and
Archidamus</span></p>
<p id="bm1" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm1">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia,
on
the like occasion whereon my services are now on
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</p>
<p id="bm2" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm2">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I think, this coming summer, the King of
Sicilia
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</p>
<p id="bm3" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm3">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will
be
justified in our loves; for indeed&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm4" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm4">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you,&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm5" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm5">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my
knowledge:
we cannot with such magnificence&#8212;in so rare&#8212;I know
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
us.</p>
<p id="bm6" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm6">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">You pay a great deal too dear for what&#8217;s
given freely.</p>
<p id="bm7" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm7">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs
me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</p>
<p id="bm8" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm8">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to
Bohemia.
They were trained together in their childhoods; and
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters,
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>
<p id="bm9" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm9">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I think there is not in the world either malice
or
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
into my note.</p>
<p id="bm10" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm10">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him:
it
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
see him a man.</p>
<p id="bm11" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm11">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Would they else be content to die?</p>
<p id="bm12" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm12">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they
should
desire to live.</p>
<p id="bm13" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm13">Archidamus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If the king had no son, they would desire to
live
on crutches till he had one.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A room of state in the same.</h4>

Mamillius, Polixenes, Camillo, and Attendants</span></p>
<p id="bm14" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm14">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nine changes of the watery star hath been<br>
The shepherd&#8217;s note since we have left our throne<br>
Without a burthen: time as long again<br>
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;<br>
And yet we should, for perpetuity,<br>
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,<br>
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply<br>
With one &#8216;We thank you&#8217; many thousands moe<br>
That go before it.</p>
<p id="bm15" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm15">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Stay your thanks a while;<br>
And pay them when you part.</p>
<p id="bm16" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm16">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, that&#8217;s to-morrow.<br>
I am question&#8217;d by my fears, of what may chance<br>
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow<br>
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say<br>
&#8216;This is put forth too truly:&#8217; besides, I have
stay&#8217;d<br>
To tire your royalty.</p>
<p id="bm17" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm17">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">We are tougher, brother,<br>
Than you can put us to&#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm18" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm18">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No longer stay.</p>
<p id="bm19" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm19">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">One seven-night longer.</p>
<p id="bm20" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm20">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Very sooth, to-morrow.</p>
<p id="bm21" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm21">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll part the time between&#8217;s then;
and in that<br>
I&#8217;ll no gainsaying.</p>
<p id="bm22" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm22">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Press me not, beseech you, so.<br>
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i&#8217; the world,<br>
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,<br>
Were there necessity in your request, although<br>
&#8217;Twere needful I denied it. My affairs<br>
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder<br>
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay<br>
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,<br>
Farewell, our brother.</p>
<p id="bm23" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm23">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Tongue-tied, our queen?
speak you.</p>
<p id="bm24" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm24">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">I had thought, sir, to have held my peace
until<br>
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,<br>
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure<br>
All in Bohemia&#8217;s well; this satisfaction<br>
The by-gone day proclaim&#8217;d: say this to him,<br>
He&#8217;s beat from his best ward.</p>
<p id="bm25" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm25">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Well said, Hermione.</p>
<p id="bm26" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm26">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">To tell, he longs to see his son, were
strong:<br>
But let him say so then, and let him go;<br>
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,<br>
We&#8217;ll thwack him hence with distaffs.<br>
Yet of your royal presence I&#8217;ll adventure<br>
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia<br>
You take my lord, I&#8217;ll give him my commission<br>
To let him there a month behind the gest<br>
Prefix&#8217;d for&#8217;s parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,<br>
I love thee not a jar o&#8217; the clock behind<br>
What lady-she her lord. You&#8217;ll stay?</p>
<p id="bm27" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm27">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, madam.</p>
<p id="bm28" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm28">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but you will?</p>
<p id="bm29" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm29">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I may not, verily.</p>
<p id="bm30" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm30">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Verily!<br>
You put me off with limber vows; but I,<br>
Though you would seek to unsphere the
stars with oaths,<br>
Should yet say &#8216;sir, no going.&#8217; Verily,<br>
You shall not go: a lady&#8217;s &#8216;Verily&#8217; &#8217;s<br>
As potent as a lord&#8217;s. Will you go yet?<br>
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,<br>
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees<br>
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?<br>
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread &#8216;Verily,&#8217;<br>
One of them you shall be.</p>
<p id="bm31" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm31">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Your guest, then, madam:<br>
To be your prisoner should import offending;<br>
Which is for me less easy to commit<br>
Than you to punish.</p>
<p id="bm32" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm32">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not your gaoler, then,<br>
But your kind hostess. Come, I&#8217;ll question you<br>
Of my lord&#8217;s tricks and yours when you were boys:<br>
You were pretty lordings then?</p>
<p id="bm33" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm33">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">We were, fair queen,<br>
Two lads that thought there was no more behind<br>
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,<br>
And to be boy eternal.</p>
<p id="bm34" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm34">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Was not my lord<br>
The verier wag o&#8217; the two?</p>
<p id="bm35" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm35">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">We were as twinn&#8217;d lambs that did frisk
i&#8217; the sun,<br>
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed<br>
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not<br>
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream&#8217;d<br>
That any did. Had we pursued that life,<br>
And our weak spirits ne&#8217;er been higher rear&#8217;d<br>
With stronger blood, we should have answer&#8217;d heaven<br>
Boldly &#8216;not guilty;&#8217; the imposition clear&#8217;d<br>
Hereditary ours.</p>
<p id="bm36" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm36">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By this we gather<br>
You have tripp&#8217;d since.</p>
<p id="bm37" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm37">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O my most sacred lady!<br>
Temptations have since then been born to&#8217;s; for<br>
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;<br>
Your precious self had then not cross&#8217;d the eyes<br>
Of my young play-fellow.</p>
<p id="bm38" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm38">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Grace to boot!<br>
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say<br>
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;<br>
The offences we have made you do we&#8217;ll answer,<br>
If you first sinn&#8217;d with us and that with us<br>
You did continue fault and that you slipp&#8217;d not<br>
With any but with us.</p>
<p id="bm39" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm39">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Is he won yet?</p>
<p id="bm40" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm40">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll stay my lord.</p>
<p id="bm41" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm41">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">At my request he would not.<br>
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest<br>
To better purpose.</p>
<p id="bm42" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm42">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Never?</p>
<p id="bm43" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm43">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Never, but once.</p>
<p id="bm44" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm44">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">What! have I twice said well? when was&#8217;t
before?<br>
I prithee tell me; cram&#8217;s with praise, and make&#8217;s<br>
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless<br>
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.<br>
Our praises are our wages: you may ride&#8217;s<br>
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere<br>
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:<br>
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:<br>
What was my first? it has an elder sister,<br>
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!<br>
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?<br>
Nay, let me have&#8217;t; I long.</p>
<p id="bm45" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm45">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, that was when<br>
Three crabbed months had sour&#8217;d themselves to death,<br>
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand<br>
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter<br>
&#8216;I am yours for ever.&#8217;</p>
<p id="bm46" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm46">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis grace indeed.<br>
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:<br>
The one for ever earn&#8217;d a royal husband;<br>
The other for some while a friend.</p>
<p id="bm47" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm47">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Too hot, too
hot!<br>
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.<br>
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;<br>
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment<br>
May a free face put on, derive a liberty<br>
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,<br>
And well become the agent; &#8217;t may, I grant;<br>
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,<br>
As now they are, and making practised smiles,<br>
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as &#8217;twere<br>
The mort o&#8217; the deer; O, that is entertainment<br>
My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,<br>
Art thou my boy?</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, my good lord.</p>

<p class="speech">I&#8217; fecks!<br>
Why, that&#8217;s my bawcock. What, hast
smutch&#8217;d thy nose?<br>
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,<br>
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:<br>
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf<br>
Are all call&#8217;d neat.&#8212;Still virginalling<br>
Upon his palm!&#8212;How now, you wanton calf!<br>
Art thou my calf?</p>
<p id="bm50" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm50">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Yes, if you will, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm51" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm51">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou want&#8217;st a rough pash and the shoots
that I have,<br>
To be full like me: yet they say we are<br>
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,<br>
That will say anything but were they false<br>
As o&#8217;er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false<br>
As dice are to be wish&#8217;d by one that fixes<br>
No bourn &#8217;twixt his and mine, yet were it true<br>
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,<br>
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!<br>
Most dear&#8217;st! my collop! Can thy dam?&#8212;may&#8217;t
be?&#8212;<br>
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:<br>
Thou dost make possible things not so held,<br>
Communicatest with dreams;&#8212;how can this be?&#8212;<br>
With what&#8217;s unreal thou coactive art,<br>
And fellow&#8217;st nothing: then &#8217;tis very credent<br>
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,<br>
And that beyond commission, and I find it,<br>
And that to the infection of my brains<br>
And hardening of my brows.</p>

What cheer? how is&#8217;t with you, best brother?</p>
<p id="bm55" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm55">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">You look as if you held a brow of much
distraction<br>
Are you moved, my lord?</p>
<p id="bm56" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm56">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, in good earnest.<br>
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,<br>
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime<br>
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines<br>
Of my boy&#8217;s face, methoughts I did recoil<br>
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech&#8217;d,<br>
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,<br>
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,<br>
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:<br>
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,<br>
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,<br>
Will you take eggs for money?</p>
<p id="bm57" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm57">Mamillius</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, my lord, I&#8217;ll fight.</p>
<p id="bm58" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm58">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">You will! why, happy man be&#8217;s dole! My
brother,<br>
Are you so fond of your young prince as we<br>
Do seem to be of ours?</p>
<p id="bm59" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm59">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">If at home, sir,<br>
He&#8217;s all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,<br>
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,<br>
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:<br>
He makes a July&#8217;s day short as December,<br>
And with his varying childness cures in me<br>
Thoughts that would thick my blood.</p>
<p id="bm60" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm60">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">So stands this squire<br>
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,<br>
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,<br>
How thou lovest us, show in our brother&#8217;s welcome;<br>
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:<br>
Next to thyself and my young rover, he&#8217;s<br>
Apparent to my heart.</p>
<p id="bm61" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm61">Hermione</a></p>

We are yours i&#8217; the garden: shall&#8217;s attend you
there?</p>
<p id="bm62" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm62">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">To your own bents dispose you: you&#8217;ll be
found,<br>
Be you beneath the sky.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I am angling now,<br>
Though you perceive me not how I give line.<br>
Go to, go to!<br>
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!<br>
And arms her with the boldness of a wife<br>
To her allowing husband!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Polixenes, Hermione,

Inch-thick, knee-deep, o&#8217;er head and

Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I<br>
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue<br>
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour<br>
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.<br>
There have been,<br>
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;<br>
And many a man there is, even at this present,<br>
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,<br>
That little thinks she has been sluiced in&#8217;s absence<br>
And his pond fish&#8217;d by his next neighbour, by<br>
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there&#8217;s comfort in&#8217;t<br>
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open&#8217;d,<br>
As mine, against their will. Should all despair<br>
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind<br>
Would hang themselves. Physic for&#8217;t there is none;<br>
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike<br>
Where &#8217;tis predominant; and &#8217;tis powerful, think
it,<br>
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,<br>
No barricado for a belly; know&#8217;t;<br>
It will let in and out the enemy<br>
With bag and baggage: many thousand on&#8217;s<br>
Have the disease, and feel&#8217;t not. How now, boy!</p>

<p id="bm65" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm65">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p id="bm66" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm66">Leontes</a></p>

<p id="bm67" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm67">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">You had much ado to make his anchor hold:<br>
When you cast out, it still came home.</p>
<p id="bm68" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm68">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Didst note it?</p>
<p id="bm69" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm69">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">He would not stay at your petitions: made<br>
His business more material.</p>
<p id="bm70" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm70">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Didst perceive it?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">They&#8217;re here with me already, whispering,
rounding<br>
&#8217;sicilia is a so-forth:&#8217; &#8217;tis far gone,<br>
When I shall gust it last. How came&#8217;t, Camillo,<br>
That he did stay?</p>
<p id="bm71" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm71">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At the good queen&#8217;s
entreaty.</p>
<p id="bm72" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm72">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">At the queen&#8217;s be&#8217;t:
&#8217;good&#8217; should be pertinent<br>
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken<br>
By any understanding pate but thine?<br>
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in<br>
More than the common blocks: not noted, is&#8217;t,<br>
But of the finer natures? by some severals<br>
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes<br>
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.</p>
<p id="bm73" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm73">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Business, my lord! I think most understand<br>
Bohemia stays here longer.</p>
<p id="bm74" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm74">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ha!</p>
<p id="bm75" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm75">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Stays here longer.</p>
<p id="bm76" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm76">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but why?</p>
<p id="bm77" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm77">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">To satisfy your highness and the entreaties<br>
Of our most gracious mistress.</p>
<p id="bm78" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm78">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Satisfy!<br>
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!<br>
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,<br>
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well<br>
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou<br>
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed<br>
Thy penitent reform&#8217;d: but we have been<br>
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived<br>
In that which seems so.</p>
<p id="bm79" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm79">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Be it forbid, my lord!</p>
<p id="bm80" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm80">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">To bide upon&#8217;t, thou art not honest,
or,<br>
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,<br>
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining<br>
From course required; or else thou must be counted<br>
A servant grafted in my serious trust<br>
And therein negligent; or else a fool<br>
That seest a game play&#8217;d home, the rich stake drawn,<br>
And takest it all for jest.</p>
<p id="bm81" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm81">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord,<br>
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;<br>
In every one of these no man is free,<br>
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,<br>
Among the infinite doings of the world,<br>
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,<br>
If ever I were wilful-negligent,<br>
It was my folly; if industriously<br>
I play&#8217;d the fool, it was my negligence,<br>
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful<br>
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,<br>
Where of the execution did cry out<br>
Against the non-performance, &#8217;twas a fear<br>
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,<br>
Are such allow&#8217;d infirmities that honesty<br>
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,<br>
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass<br>
By its own visage: if I then deny it,<br>
&#8217;Tis none of mine.</p>
<p id="bm82" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm82">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ha&#8217; not you seen,
Camillo,&#8212;<br>
But that&#8217;s past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass<br>
Is thicker than a cuckold&#8217;s horn,&#8212;or heard,&#8212;<br>
For to a vision so apparent rumour<br>
Cannot be mute,&#8212;or thought,&#8212;for cogitation<br>
Resides not in that man that does not think,&#8212;<br>
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,<br>
Or else be impudently negative,<br>
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say<br>
My wife&#8217;s a hobby-horse, deserves a name<br>
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to<br>
Before her troth-plight: say&#8217;t and justify&#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm83" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm83">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I would not be a stander-by to hear<br>
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without<br>
My present vengeance taken: &#8217;shrew my heart,<br>
You never spoke what did become you less<br>
Than this; which to reiterate were sin<br>
As deep as that, though true.</p>
<p id="bm84" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm84">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Is whispering nothing?<br>
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?<br>
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career<br>
Of laughing with a sigh?&#8212;a note infallible<br>
Of breaking honesty&#8212;horsing foot on foot?<br>
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?<br>
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes<br>
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,<br>
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?<br>
Why, then the world and all that&#8217;s in&#8217;t is nothing;<br>
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;<br>
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,<br>
If this be nothing.</p>
<p id="bm85" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm85">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, be cured<br>
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;<br>
For &#8217;tis most dangerous.</p>
<p id="bm86" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm86">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Say it be, &#8217;tis true.</p>
<p id="bm87" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm87">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, no, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm88" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm88">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It is; you lie, you lie:<br>
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,<br>
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,<br>
Or else a hovering temporizer, that<br>
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,<br>
Inclining to them both: were my wife&#8217;s liver<br>
Infected as her life, she would not live<br>
The running of one glass.</p>
<p id="bm89" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm89">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who does infect her?</p>
<p id="bm90" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm90">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging<br>
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I<br>
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes<br>
To see alike mine honour as their profits,<br>
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that<br>
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,<br>
His cupbearer,&#8212;whom I from meaner form<br>
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see<br>
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,<br>
How I am galled,&#8212;mightst bespice a cup,<br>
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;<br>
Which draught to me were cordial.</p>
<p id="bm91" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm91">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my lord,<br>
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,<br>
But with a lingering dram that should not work<br>
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot<br>
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,<br>
So sovereignly being honourable.<br>
I have loved thee,&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm92" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm92">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Make that thy question, and go rot!<br>
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,<br>
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully<br>
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,<br>
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted<br>
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,<br>
Give scandal to the blood o&#8217; the prince my son,<br>
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,<br>
Without ripe moving to&#8217;t? Would I do this?<br>
Could man so blench?</p>
<p id="bm93" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm93">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I must believe you, sir:<br>
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for&#8217;t;<br>
Provided that, when he&#8217;s removed, your highness<br>
Will take again your queen as yours at first,<br>
Even for your son&#8217;s sake; and thereby for sealing<br>
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms<br>
Known and allied to yours.</p>
<p id="bm94" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm94">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou dost advise me<br>
Even so as I mine own course have set down:<br>
I&#8217;ll give no blemish to her honour, none.</p>
<p id="bm95" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm95">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
Go then; and with a countenance as clear<br>
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia<br>
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:<br>
If from me he have wholesome beverage,<br>
Account me not your servant.</p>
<p id="bm96" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm96">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">This is all:<br>
Do&#8217;t and thou hast the one half of my heart;<br>
Do&#8217;t not, thou split&#8217;st thine own.</p>
<p id="bm97" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm97">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll do&#8217;t, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm98" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm98">Leontes</a></p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p id="bm99" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm99">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">O miserable lady! But, for me,<br>
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner<br>
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do&#8217;t<br>
Is the obedience to a master, one<br>
Who in rebellion with himself will have<br>
All that are his so too. To do this deed,<br>
Promotion follows. If I could find example<br>
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings<br>
And flourish&#8217;d after, I&#8217;ld not do&#8217;t; but
since<br>
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,<br>
Let villany itself forswear&#8217;t. I must<br>
Forsake the court: to do&#8217;t, or no, is certain<br>
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!<br>
Here comes Bohemia.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Polixenes</span></p>
<p id="bm100" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm100">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">This is strange: methinks<br>
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?<br>
Good day, Camillo.</p>
<p id="bm101" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm101">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Hail, most royal sir!</p>
<p id="bm102" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm102">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What is the news i&#8217; the court?</p>
<p id="bm103" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm103">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">None rare, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm104" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm104">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">The king hath on him such a countenance<br>
As he had lost some province and a region<br>
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him<br>
With customary compliment; when he,<br>
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling<br>
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and<br>
So leaves me to consider what is breeding<br>
That changeth thus his manners.</p>
<p id="bm105" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm105">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I dare not know, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm106" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm106">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare
not?<br>
Be intelligent to me: &#8217;tis thereabouts;<br>
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.<br>
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,<br>
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror<br>
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be<br>
A party in this alteration, finding<br>
Myself thus alter&#8217;d with &#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm107" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm107">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">There is a sickness<br>
Which puts some of us in distemper, but<br>
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught<br>
Of you that yet are well.</p>
<p id="bm108" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm108">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How! caught of me!<br>
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:<br>
I have look&#8217;d on thousands, who have sped the better<br>
By my regard, but kill&#8217;d none so. Camillo,&#8212;<br>
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto<br>
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns<br>
Our gentry than our parents&#8217; noble names,<br>
In whose success we are gentle,&#8212;I beseech you,<br>
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge<br>
Thereof to be inform&#8217;d, imprison&#8217;t not<br>
In ignorant concealment.</p>
<p id="bm109" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm109">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I may not answer.</p>
<p id="bm110" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm110">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!<br>
I must be answer&#8217;d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,<br>
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man<br>
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least<br>
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare<br>
What incidency thou dost guess of harm<br>
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;<br>
Which way to be prevented, if to be;<br>
If not, how best to bear it.</p>
<p id="bm111" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm111">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I will tell you;<br>
Since I am charged in honour and by him<br>
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,<br>
Which must be even as swiftly follow&#8217;d as<br>
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me<br>
Cry lost, and so good night!</p>
<p id="bm112" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm112">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">On, good Camillo.</p>
<p id="bm113" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm113">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am appointed him to murder you.</p>
<p id="bm114" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm114">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">By whom, Camillo?</p>
<p id="bm115" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm115">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By the king.</p>
<p id="bm116" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm116">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">For what?</p>
<p id="bm117" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm117">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">He thinks, nay, with all confidence he
swears,<br>
As he had seen&#8217;t or been an instrument<br>
To vice you to&#8217;t, that you have touch&#8217;d his queen<br>
Forbiddenly.</p>
<p id="bm118" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm118">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, then my best blood turn<br>
To an infected jelly and my name<br>
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!<br>
Turn then my freshest reputation to<br>
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril<br>
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn&#8217;d,<br>
Nay, hated too, worse than the great&#8217;st infection<br>
That e&#8217;er was heard or read!</p>
<p id="bm119" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm119">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Swear his thought over<br>
By each particular star in heaven and<br>
By all their influences, you may as well<br>
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon<br>
As or by oath remove or counsel shake<br>
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation<br>
Is piled upon his faith and will continue<br>
The standing of his body.</p>
<p id="bm120" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm120">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How should this grow?</p>
<p id="bm121" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm121">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I know not: but I am sure &#8217;tis safer to<br>
Avoid what&#8217;s grown than question how &#8217;tis born.<br>
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,<br>
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you<br>
Shall bear along impawn&#8217;d, away to-night!<br>
Your followers I will whisper to the business,<br>
And will by twos and threes at several posterns<br>
Clear them o&#8217; the city. For myself, I&#8217;ll put<br>
My fortunes to your service, which are here<br>
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;<br>
For, by the honour of my parents, I<br>
Have utter&#8217;d truth: which if you seek to prove,<br>
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer<br>
Than one condemn&#8217;d by the king&#8217;s own mouth, thereon<br>
His execution sworn.</p>
<p id="bm122" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm122">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I do believe thee:<br>
I saw his heart in &#8217;s face. Give me thy hand:<br>
Be pilot to me and thy places shall<br>
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and<br>
My people did expect my hence departure<br>
Two days ago. This jealousy<br>
Is for a precious creature: as she&#8217;s rare,<br>
Must it be great, and as his person&#8217;s mighty,<br>
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive<br>
He is dishonour&#8217;d by a man which ever<br>
Profess&#8217;d to him, why, his revenges must<br>
In that be made more bitter. Fear o&#8217;ershades me:<br>
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort<br>
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing<br>

Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,<br>

Too much hair there, but in a semicircle<br>
Or a half-moon made with a pen.</p>

That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.</p>

<p class="speech">How blest am I<br>
In my just censure, in my true opinion!<br>
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed<br>
In being so blest! There may be in the cup<br>
A spider steep&#8217;d, and one may drink, depart,<br>
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge<br>
Is not infected: but if one present<br>
The abhorr&#8217;d ingredient to his eye, make known<br>
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,<br>
With violent hefts. I have drunk,
and seen the spider.<br>
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:<br>
There is a plot against my life, my crown;<br>
All&#8217;s true that is mistrusted: that false villain<br>
Whom I employ&#8217;d was pre-employ&#8217;d by him:<br>
He has discover&#8217;d my design, and I<br>
Remain a pinch&#8217;d thing; yea, a very trick<br>
For them to play at will. How came the posterns<br>
So easily open?</p>

Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:<br>
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you<br>
Have too much blood in him.</p>

<p id="bm152" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm152">Leontes</a></p>

Away with him! and let her sport herself<br>
With that she&#8217;s big with; for &#8217;tis Polixenes<br>
Has made thee swell thus.</p>

<p class="speech">You, my lords,<br>
Look on her, mark her well; be but about<br>
To say &#8216;she is a goodly lady,&#8217; and<br>
The justice of your bearts will thereto add<br>
&#8217;Tis pity she&#8217;s not honest, honourable:&#8217;<br>
Praise her but for this her without-door form,<br>
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight<br>
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands<br>
That calumny doth use&#8212;O, I am out&#8212;<br>
That mercy does, for calumny will sear<br>
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha&#8217;s,<br>
When you have said &#8216;she&#8217;s goodly,&#8217; come
between<br>
Ere you can say &#8216;she&#8217;s honest:&#8217; but be &#8217;t
known,<br>
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,<br>
She&#8217;s an adulteress.</p>
<p id="bm155" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm155">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">Should a villain say so,<br>
The most replenish&#8217;d villain in the world,<br>
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,<br>
Do but mistake.</p>
<p id="bm156" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm156">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You have mistook, my lady,<br>
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!<br>
Which I&#8217;ll not call a creature of thy place,<br>
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,<br>
Should a like language use to all degrees<br>
And mannerly distinguishment leave out<br>
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said<br>
She&#8217;s an adulteress; I have said with whom:<br>
More, she&#8217;s a traitor and Camillo is<br>
A federary with her, and one that knows<br>
What she should shame to know herself<br>
But with her most vile principal, that she&#8217;s<br>
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those<br>
That vulgars give bold&#8217;st titles, ay, and privy<br>
To this their late escape.</p>
<p id="bm157" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm157">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, by my life.<br>
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,<br>
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<br>
You thus have publish&#8217;d me! Gentle my lord,<br>
You scarce can right me throughly then to say<br>
You did mistake.</p>
<p id="bm158" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm158">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No; if I mistake<br>
In those foundations which I build upon,<br>
The centre is not big enough to bear<br>
A school-boy&#8217;s top. Away with her! to prison!<br>
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty<br>
But that he speaks.</p>
<p id="bm159" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm159">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s some ill planet reigns:<br>
I must be patient till the heavens look<br>
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,<br>
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<br>
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew<br>
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have<br>
That honourable grief lodged here which burns<br>
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,<br>
With thoughts so qualified as your charities<br>
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<br>
The king&#8217;s will be perform&#8217;d!</p>
<p id="bm160" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm160">Leontes</a></p>

<p class="speech">Who is&#8217;t that goes with me? Beseech your
highness,<br>
My women may be with me; for you see<br>
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;<br>
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress<br>
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<br>
As I come out: this action I now go on<br>
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:<br>
I never wish&#8217;d to see you sorry; now<br>
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.</p>

<p class="speech">For her, my lord,<br>
I dare my life lay down and will do&#8217;t, sir,<br>
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless<br>
I&#8217; the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,<br>
In this which you accuse her.</p>

She&#8217;s otherwise, I&#8217;ll keep my stables where<br>
I lodge my wife; I&#8217;ll go in couples with her;<br>
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;<br>
For every inch of woman in the world,<br>
Ay, every dram of woman&#8217;s flesh is false, If she be.</p>
<p id="bm167" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm167">Leontes</a></p>

<p id="bm169" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm169">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:<br>
You are abused and by some putter-on<br>
That will be damn&#8217;d for&#8217;t; would I knew the
villain,<br>
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw&#8217;d,<br>
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven<br>
The second and the third, nine, and some five;<br>
If this prove true, they&#8217;ll pay for&#8217;t:
by mine honour,<br>
I&#8217;ll geld &#8217;em all; fourteen they shall not see,<br>
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;<br>
And I had rather glib myself than they<br>
Should not produce fair issue.</p>
<p id="bm170" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm170">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Cease; no more.<br>
You smell this business with a sense as cold<br>
As is a dead man&#8217;s nose: but I do see&#8217;t and
feel&#8217;t<br>
As you feel doing thus; and see withal<br>
The instruments that feel.</p>
<p id="bm171" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm171">Antigonus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If it be so,<br>
We need no grave to bury honesty:<br>
There&#8217;s not a grain of it the face to sweeten<br>
Of the whole dungy earth.</p>
<p id="bm172" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm172">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What! lack I credit?</p>
<p id="bm173" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm173">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,<br>
Upon this ground; and more it would content me<br>
To have her honour true than your suspicion,<br>
Be blamed for&#8217;t how you might.</p>
<p id="bm174" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm174">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, what need we<br>
Commune with you of this, but rather follow<br>
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative<br>
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness<br>
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied<br>
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not<br>
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves<br>
We need no more of your advice: the matter,<br>
The loss, the gain, the ordering on&#8217;t, is all<br>
Properly ours.</p>

You had only in your silent judgment tried it,<br>
Without more overture.</p>
<p id="bm176" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm176">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">How could that be?<br>
Either thou art most ignorant by age,<br>
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo&#8217;s flight,<br>
Added to their familiarity,<br>
Which was as gross as ever touch&#8217;d conjecture,<br>
That lack&#8217;d sight only, nought for approbation<br>
But only seeing, all other circumstances<br>
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:<br>
Yet, for a greater confirmation,<br>
For in an act of this importance &#8217;twere<br>
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch&#8217;d in post<br>
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo&#8217;s temple,<br>
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know<br>
Of stuff&#8217;d sufficiency: now from the oracle<br>
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,<br>
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?</p>
<p id="bm177" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm177">First Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Well done, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm178" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm178">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Though I am satisfied and need no more<br>
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle<br>
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he<br>
Whose ignorant credulity will not<br>
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good<br>
From our free person she should be confined,<br>
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence<br>
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;<br>
We are to speak in public; for this business<br>
Will raise us all.</p>

As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry<br>
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it<br>
To some remote and desert place quite out<br>
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,<br>
Without more mercy, to its own protection<br>
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune<br>
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,<br>
On thy soul&#8217;s peril and thy body&#8217;s torture,<br>

To say &#8216;not guilty:&#8217; mine integrity<br>
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<br>
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<br>
Behold our human actions, as they do,<br>
I doubt not then but innocence shall make<br>
False accusation blush and tyranny<br>
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<br>
Who least will seem to do so, my past life<br>
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<br>
As I am now unhappy; which is more<br>
Than history can pattern, though devised<br>
And play&#8217;d to take spectators. For behold me<br>
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe<br>
A moiety of the throne a great king&#8217;s daughter,<br>
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<br>
To prate and talk for life and honour &#8217;fore<br>
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<br>
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,<br>
&#8217;Tis a derivative from me to mine,<br>
And only that I stand for. I appeal<br>
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<br>
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<br>
How merited to be so; since he came,<br>
With what encounter so uncurrent I<br>
Have strain&#8217;d to appear thus: if one jot beyond<br>
The bound of honour, or in act or will<br>
That way inclining, harden&#8217;d be the hearts<br>
Of all that hear me, and my near&#8217;st of kin<br>
Cry fie upon my grave!</p>

Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not<br>
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,<br>
With whom I am accused, I do confess<br>
I loved him as in honour he required,<br>
With such a kind of love as might become<br>
A lady like me, with a love even such,<br>
So and no other, as yourself commanded:<br>
Which not to have done I think had been in me<br>
Both disobedience and ingratitude<br>
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,<br>
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely<br>
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,<br>
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish&#8217;d<br>
For me to try how: all I know of it<br>
Is that Camillo was an honest man;<br>
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,<br>
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.</p>

You had a bastard by Polixenes,<br>
And I but dream&#8217;d it. As you were past all shame,&#8212;<br>
Those of your fact are so&#8212;so past all truth:<br>
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as<br>
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,<br>
No father owning it,&#8212;which is, indeed,<br>

The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<br>
To me can life be no commodity:<br>
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,<br>
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,<br>
But know not how it went. My second joy<br>
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence<br>
I am barr&#8217;d, like one infectious. My third comfort<br>
Starr&#8217;d most unluckily, is from my breast,<br>
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,<br>
Haled out to murder: myself on every post<br>
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred<br>
The child-bed privilege denied, which &#8217;longs<br>
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<br>
Here to this place, i&#8217; the open air, before<br>
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<br>
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<br>
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<br>

I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,<br>
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn&#8217;d<br>

shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an

<p id="bm329" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm329">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more
importunate:
&#8217;tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
grant this.</p>
<p id="bm330" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm330">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is fifteen years since I saw my country:
though
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o&#8217;erween to
think so, which is another spur to my departure.</p>
<p id="bm331" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm331">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest
of
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
made me businesses which none without thee can
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
them thyself or take away with thee the very
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
being gracious, than they are in losing them when
they have approved their virtues.</p>
<p id="bm332" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm332">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince.
What
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
from court and is less frequent to his princely
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</p>
<p id="bm333" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm333">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I have considered so much, Camillo, and with
some
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</p>
<p id="bm334" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm334">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</p>
<p id="bm335" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm335">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s likewise part of my intelligence;
but, I
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
appearing what we are, have some question with the
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
uneasy to get the cause of my son&#8217;s resort thither.
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.</p>

Not yet on summer&#8217;s death, nor on the birth<br>
Of trembling winter, the fairest
flowers o&#8217; the season<br>
Are our carnations and streak&#8217;d gillyvors,<br>
Which some call nature&#8217;s bastards: of that kind<br>
Our rustic garden&#8217;s barren; and I care not<br>
To get slips of them.</p>
<p id="bm386" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm386">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore, gentle maiden,<br>
Do you neglect them?</p>
<p id="bm387" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm387">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">For I have heard it said<br>
There is an art which in their piedness shares<br>
With great creating nature.</p>
<p id="bm388" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm388">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Say there be;<br>
Yet nature is made better by no mean<br>
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art<br>
Which you say adds to nature, is an art<br>
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry<br>
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,<br>
And make conceive a bark of baser kind<br>
By bud of nobler race: this is an art<br>
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but<br>
The art itself is nature.</p>
<p id="bm389" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm389">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">So it is.</p>
<p id="bm390" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm390">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,<br>
And do not call them bastards.</p>
<p id="bm391" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm391">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll not put<br>
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;<br>
No more than were I painted I would wish<br>
This youth should say &#8217;twere well and only therefore<br>
Desire to breed by me. Here&#8217;s flowers for you;<br>
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;<br>
The marigold, that goes to bed wi&#8217; the sun<br>
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers<br>
Of middle summer, and I think they are given<br>
To men of middle age. You&#8217;re very welcome.</p>
<p id="bm392" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm392">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,<br>
And only live by gazing.</p>
<p id="bm393" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm393">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">Out, alas!<br>
You&#8217;d be so lean, that blasts of January<br>
Would blow you through and through.<br>
Now, my fair&#8217;st friend,<br>
I would I had some flowers o&#8217; the spring that might<br>
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,<br>
That wear upon your virgin branches yet<br>
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,<br>
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let&#8217;st fall<br>
From Dis&#8217;s waggon! daffodils,<br>
That come before the swallow dares, and take<br>
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,<br>
But sweeter than the lids of Juno&#8217;s eyes<br>
Or Cytherea&#8217;s breath; pale primroses<br>
That die unmarried, ere they can behold<br>
Bight Phoebus in his strength&#8212;a malady<br>
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and<br>
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,<br>
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,<br>
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,<br>
To strew him o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er!</p>
<p id="bm394" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm394">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, like a corse?</p>
<p id="bm395" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm395">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;<br>
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,<br>
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:<br>
Methinks I play as I have seen them do<br>
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine<br>
Does change my disposition.</p>
<p id="bm396" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm396">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">What you do<br>
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.<br>
I&#8217;ld have you do it ever: when you sing,<br>
I&#8217;ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,<br>
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,<br>
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you<br>
A wave o&#8217; the sea, that you might ever do<br>
Nothing but that; move still, still so,<br>
And own no other function: each your doing,<br>
So singular in each particular,<br>
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,<br>
That all your acts are queens.</p>
<p id="bm397" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm397">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">O Doricles,<br>
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,<br>
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through&#8217;t,<br>
Do plainly give you out an unstain&#8217;d shepherd,<br>
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,<br>
You woo&#8217;d me the false way.</p>
<p id="bm398" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm398">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">I think you have<br>
As little skill to fear as I have purpose<br>
To put you to&#8217;t. But come; our dance, I pray:<br>
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,<br>
That never mean to part.</p>
<p id="bm399" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm399">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll swear for &#8217;em.</p>
<p id="bm400" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm400">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever<br>
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems<br>
But smacks of something greater than herself,<br>
Too noble for this place.</p>
<p id="bm401" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm401">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">He tells her something<br>
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is<br>
The queen of curds and cream.</p>

To mend her kissing with!</p>

<p class="speech">Now, in good time!</p>

Come, strike up!</p>

Shepherds and Shepherdesses</span></p>
<p id="bm406" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm406">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this<br>
Which dances with your daughter?</p>
<p id="bm407" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm407">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">They call him Doricles; and boasts himself<br>
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it<br>
Upon his own report and I believe it;<br>
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:<br>
I think so too; for never gazed the moon<br>
Upon the water as he&#8217;ll stand and read<br>
As &#8217;twere my daughter&#8217;s eyes: and, to be plain.<br>
I think there is not half a kiss to choose<br>
Who loves another best.</p>
<p id="bm408" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm408">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">She dances featly.</p>
<p id="bm409" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm409">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">So she does any thing; though I report it,<br>
That should be silent: if young Doricles<br>
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that<br>
Which he not dreams of.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Servant</span></p>
<p id="bm410" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm410">Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at
the
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
several tunes faster than you&#8217;ll tell money; he
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men&#8217;s
ears grew to his tunes.</p>
<p id="bm411" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm411">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">He could never come better; he shall come in.
I
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
indeed and sung lamentably.</p>
<p id="bm412" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm412">Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes;
no
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
burthens of dildos and fadings, &#8216;jump her and thump
her;&#8217; and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
the matter, he makes the maid to answer &#8216;Whoop, do me
no harm, good man;&#8217; puts him off, slights him, with
&#8216;Whoop, do me no harm, good man.&#8217;</p>
<p id="bm413" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm413">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">This is a brave fellow.</p>
<p id="bm414" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm414">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable
conceited
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?</p>
<p id="bm415" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm415">Servant</a></p>
<p class="speech">He hath ribbons of an the colours i&#8217; the
rainbow;
points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
sings &#8217;em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on&#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm416" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm416">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Prithee bring him in; and let him approach
singing.</p>
<p id="bm417" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm417">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in

<p class="speech verse">Lawn as white as driven snow;<br>
Cyprus black as e&#8217;er was crow;<br>
Gloves as sweet as damask roses;<br>
Masks for faces and for noses;<br>
Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,<br>
Perfume for a lady&#8217;s chamber;<br>
Golden quoifs and stomachers,<br>
For my lads to give their dears:<br>
Pins and poking-sticks of steel,<br>
What maids lack from head to heel:<br>
Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;<br>
Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.</p>
<p id="bm421" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm421">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst
take
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.</p>
<p id="bm422" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm422">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">I was promised them against the feast; but they
come
not too late now.</p>
<p id="bm423" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm423">Dorcas</a></p>
<p class="speech">He hath promised you more than that, or there be
liars.</p>
<p id="bm424" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm424">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he
has
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.</p>
<p id="bm425" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm425">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Is there no manners left among maids? will
they
wear their plackets where they should bear their
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
our guests? &#8217;tis well they are whispering: clamour
your tongues, and not a word more.</p>
<p id="bm426" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm426">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">I have done. Come, you promised me a
tawdry-lace
and a pair of sweet gloves.</p>
<p id="bm427" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm427">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the
way
and lost all my money?</p>
<p id="bm428" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm428">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
therefore it behoves men to be wary.</p>
<p id="bm429" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm429">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing
here.</p>
<p id="bm430" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm430">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels
of charge.</p>
<p id="bm431" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm431">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">What hast here? ballads?</p>
<p id="bm432" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm432">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print
o&#8217;
life, for then we are sure they are true.</p>
<p id="bm433" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm433">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s one to a very doleful tune, how a
usurer&#8217;s
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
burthen and how she longed to eat adders&#8217; heads and
toads carbonadoed.</p>
<p id="bm434" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm434">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">Is it true, think you?</p>
<p id="bm435" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm435">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Very true, and but a month old.</p>
<p id="bm436" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm436">Dorcas</a></p>
<p class="speech">Bless me from marrying a usurer!</p>
<p id="bm437" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm437">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s the midwife&#8217;s name to&#8217;t,
one Mistress
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?</p>
<p id="bm438" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm438">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">Pray you now, buy it.</p>
<p id="bm439" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm439">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come on, lay it by: and let&#8217;s first see
moe
ballads; we&#8217;ll buy the other things anon.</p>
<p id="bm440" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm440">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s another ballad of a fish, that
appeared upon
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.</p>
<p id="bm441" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm441">Dorcas</a></p>
<p class="speech">Is it true too, think you?</p>
<p id="bm442" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm442">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Five justices&#8217; hands at it, and witnesses
more than
my pack will hold.</p>
<p id="bm443" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm443">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Lay it by too: another.</p>
<p id="bm444" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm444">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty
one.</p>
<p id="bm445" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm445">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s have some merry ones.</p>
<p id="bm446" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm446">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
the tune of &#8216;Two maids wooing a man:&#8217; there&#8217;s
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; &#8217;tis in
request, I can tell you.</p>
<p id="bm447" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm447">Mopsa</a></p>
<p class="speech">We can both sing it: if thou&#8217;lt bear a
part, thou
shalt hear; &#8217;tis in three parts.</p>
<p id="bm448" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm448">Dorcas</a></p>

Thou to me thy secrets tell.</p>

<p class="speech">Me too, let me go thither.</p>
<p id="bm456" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm456">Mopsa</a></p>

three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
not in&#8217;t; but they themselves are o&#8217; the mind, if
it
be not too rough for some that know little but
bowling, it will please plentifully.</p>

The pedlar&#8217;s silken treasury and have pour&#8217;d it<br>
To her acceptance; you have let him go<br>
And nothing marted with him. If your lass<br>
Interpretation should abuse and call this<br>
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited<br>
For a reply, at least if you make a care<br>
Of happy holding her.</p>
<p id="bm472" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm472">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Old sir, I know<br>
She prizes not such trifles as these are:<br>
The gifts she looks from me are pack&#8217;d and lock&#8217;d<br>
Up in my heart; which I have given already,<br>
But not deliver&#8217;d. O, hear me breathe my life<br>
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,<br>
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,<br>
As soft as dove&#8217;s down and as white as it,<br>
Or Ethiopian&#8217;s tooth, or the fann&#8217;d
snow that&#8217;s bolted<br>
By the northern blasts twice o&#8217;er.</p>
<p id="bm473" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm473">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What follows this?<br>
How prettily the young swain seems to wash<br>
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:<br>
But to your protestation; let me hear<br>
What you profess.</p>
<p id="bm474" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm474">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do, and be witness to &#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm475" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm475">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">And this my neighbour too?</p>
<p id="bm476" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm476">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">And he, and more<br>
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:<br>
That, were I crown&#8217;d the most imperial monarch,<br>
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth<br>
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge<br>
More than was ever man&#8217;s, I would not prize them<br>
Without her love; for her employ them all;<br>
Commend them and condemn them to her service<br>
Or to their own perdition.</p>
<p id="bm477" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm477">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Fairly offer&#8217;d.</p>
<p id="bm478" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm478">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">This shows a sound affection.</p>
<p id="bm479" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm479">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">But, my daughter,<br>
Say you the like to him?</p>
<p id="bm480" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm480">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">I cannot speak<br>
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:<br>
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out<br>
The purity of his.</p>
<p id="bm481" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm481">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Take hands, a bargain!<br>
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to &#8217;t:<br>
I give my daughter to him, and will make<br>
Her portion equal his.</p>
<p id="bm482" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm482">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, that must be<br>
I&#8217; the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,<br>
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;<br>
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,<br>
Contract us &#8217;fore these witnesses.</p>
<p id="bm483" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm483">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come, your hand;<br>
And, daughter, yours.</p>
<p id="bm484" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm484">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;<br>
Have you a father?</p>
<p id="bm485" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm485">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I have: but what of him?</p>
<p id="bm486" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm486">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Knows he of this?</p>
<p id="bm487" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm487">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He neither does nor shall.</p>
<p id="bm488" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm488">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Methinks a father<br>
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest<br>
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,<br>
Is not your father grown incapable<br>
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid<br>
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?<br>
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?<br>
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing<br>
But what he did being childish?</p>
<p id="bm489" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm489">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, good sir;<br>
He has his health and ampler strength indeed<br>
Than most have of his age.</p>
<p id="bm490" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm490">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">By my white beard,<br>
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong<br>
Something unfilial: reason my son<br>
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason<br>
The father, all whose joy is nothing else<br>
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel<br>
In such a business.</p>
<p id="bm491" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm491">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">I yield all this;<br>
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,<br>
Which &#8217;tis not fit you know, I not acquaint<br>
My father of this business.</p>
<p id="bm492" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm492">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let him know&#8217;t.</p>
<p id="bm493" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm493">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">He shall not.</p>
<p id="bm494" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm494">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Prithee, let him.</p>
<p id="bm495" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm495">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, he must not.</p>
<p id="bm496" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm496">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve<br>
At knowing of thy choice.</p>
<p id="bm497" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm497">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, he must not.<br>
Mark our contract.</p>
<p id="bm498" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm498">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Mark your divorce, young sir,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Discovering
himself</span></p>
<p class="speech">Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base<br>
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre&#8217;s heir,<br>
That thus affect&#8217;st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,<br>
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can<br>
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece<br>
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know<br>
The royal fool thou copest with,&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm499" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm499">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, my heart!</p>
<p id="bm500" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm500">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have thy beauty scratch&#8217;d with
briers, and made<br>
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,<br>
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh<br>
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never<br>
I mean thou shalt, we&#8217;ll bar thee from succession;<br>
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,<br>
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:<br>
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,<br>
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee<br>
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.&#8212;<br>
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,<br>
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,<br>
Unworthy thee,&#8212;if ever henceforth thou<br>
These rural latches to his entrance open,<br>
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,<br>
I will devise a death as cruel for thee<br>
As thou art tender to&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p id="bm501" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm501">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">Even here undone!<br>
I was not much afeard; for once or twice<br>
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,<br>
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court<br>
Hides not his visage from our cottage but<br>
Looks on alike. Will&#8217;t please you, sir, be gone?<br>
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,<br>
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,&#8212;<br>
Being now awake, I&#8217;ll queen it no inch farther,<br>
But milk my ewes and weep.</p>
<p id="bm502" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm502">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, father!<br>
Speak ere thou diest.</p>
<p id="bm503" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm503">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">I cannot speak, nor think<br>
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!<br>
You have undone a man of fourscore three,<br>
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,<br>
To die upon the bed my father died,<br>
To lie close by his honest bones: but now<br>
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me<br>
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,<br>
That knew&#8217;st this was the prince,
and wouldst adventure<br>
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!<br>
If I might die within this hour, I have lived<br>
To die when I desire.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p id="bm504" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm504">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why look you so upon me?<br>
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay&#8217;d,<br>
But nothing alter&#8217;d: what I was, I am;<br>
More straining on for plucking back, not following<br>
My leash unwillingly.</p>
<p id="bm505" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm505">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Gracious my lord,<br>
You know your father&#8217;s temper: at this time<br>
He will allow no speech, which I do guess<br>
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly<br>
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:<br>
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,<br>
Come not before him.</p>
<p id="bm506" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm506">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">I not purpose it.<br>
I think, Camillo?</p>
<p id="bm507" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm507">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Even he, my lord.</p>
<p id="bm508" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm508">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">How often have I told you &#8217;twould be
thus!<br>
How often said, my dignity would last<br>
But till &#8217;twere known!</p>
<p id="bm509" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm509">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">It cannot fail but by<br>
The violation of my faith; and then<br>
Let nature crush the sides o&#8217; the earth together<br>
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:<br>
From my succession wipe me, father; I<br>
Am heir to my affection.</p>
<p id="bm510" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm510">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Be advised.</p>
<p id="bm511" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm511">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am, and by my fancy: if my reason<br>
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;<br>
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,<br>
Do bid it welcome.</p>
<p id="bm512" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm512">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;This is desperate, sir.</p>
<p id="bm513" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm513">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;<br>
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,<br>
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may<br>
Be thereat glean&#8217;d, for all the sun sees or<br>
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides<br>
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath<br>
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,<br>
As you have ever been my father&#8217;s honour&#8217;d friend,<br>
When he shall miss me,&#8212;as, in faith, I mean not<br>
To see him any more,&#8212;cast your good counsels<br>
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune<br>
Tug for the time to come. This you may know<br>
And so deliver, I am put to sea<br>
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;<br>
And most opportune to our need I have<br>
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared<br>
For this design. What course I mean to hold<br>
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor<br>
Concern me the reporting.</p>
<p id="bm514" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm514">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">O my lord!<br>
I would your spirit were easier for advice,<br>
Or stronger for your need.</p>
<p id="bm515" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm515">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Hark, Perdita</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drawing her aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll hear you by and by.</p>
<p id="bm516" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm516">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s irremoveable,<br>
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if<br>
His going I could frame to serve my turn,<br>
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,<br>
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia<br>
And that unhappy king, my master, whom<br>
I so much thirst to see.</p>
<p id="bm517" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm517">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Now, good Camillo;<br>
I am so fraught with curious business that<br>
I leave out ceremony.</p>
<p id="bm518" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm518">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I think<br>
You have heard of my poor services, i&#8217; the love<br>
That I have borne your father?</p>
<p id="bm519" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm519">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Very nobly<br>
Have you deserved: it is my father&#8217;s music<br>
To speak your deeds, not little of his care<br>
To have them recompensed as thought on.</p>
<p id="bm520" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm520">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Well, my lord,<br>
If you may please to think I love the king<br>
And through him what is nearest to him, which is<br>
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:<br>
If your more ponderous and settled project<br>
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,<br>
I&#8217;ll point you where you shall have such receiving<br>
As shall become your highness; where you may<br>
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,<br>
There&#8217;s no disjunction to be made, but by&#8212;<br>
As heavens forefend!&#8212;your ruin; marry her,<br>
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,<br>
Your discontenting father strive to qualify<br>
And bring him up to liking.</p>
<p id="bm521" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm521">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">How, Camillo,<br>
May this, almost a miracle, be done?<br>
That I may call thee something more than man<br>
And after that trust to thee.</p>
<p id="bm522" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm522">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Have you thought on<br>
A place whereto you&#8217;ll go?</p>
<p id="bm523" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm523">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not any yet:<br>
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty<br>
To what we wildly do, so we profess<br>
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies<br>
Of every wind that blows.</p>
<p id="bm524" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm524">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Then list to me:<br>
This follows, if you will not change your purpose<br>
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,<br>
And there present yourself and your fair princess,<br>
For so I see she must be, &#8217;fore Leontes:<br>
She shall be habited as it becomes<br>
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see<br>
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping<br>
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,<br>
As &#8217;twere i&#8217; the father&#8217;s person; kisses the
hands<br>
Of your fresh princess; o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er divides him<br>
&#8217;Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one<br>
He chides to hell and bids the other grow<br>
Faster than thought or time.</p>
<p id="bm525" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm525">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Camillo,<br>
What colour for my visitation shall I<br>
Hold up before him?</p>
<p id="bm526" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm526">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sent by the king your father<br>
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,<br>
The manner of your bearing towards him, with<br>
What you as from your father shall deliver,<br>
Things known betwixt us three, I&#8217;ll write you down:<br>
The which shall point you forth at every sitting<br>
What you must say; that he shall not perceive<br>
But that you have your father&#8217;s bosom there<br>
And speak his very heart.</p>
<p id="bm527" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm527">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am bound to you:<br>
There is some sap in this.</p>
<p id="bm528" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm528">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">A cause more promising<br>
Than a wild dedication of yourselves<br>
To unpath&#8217;d waters, undream&#8217;d shores, most certain<br>
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,<br>
But as you shake off one to take another;<br>
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who<br>
Do their best office, if they can but stay you<br>
Where you&#8217;ll be loath to be: besides you know<br>
Prosperity&#8217;s the very bond of love,<br>
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together<br>
Affliction alters.</p>
<p id="bm529" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm529">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;One of these is true:<br>
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,<br>
But not take in the mind.</p>
<p id="bm530" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm530">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">Yea, say you so?<br>
There shall not at your father&#8217;s house these
seven years<br>
Be born another such.</p>
<p id="bm531" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm531">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">My good Camillo,<br>
She is as forward of her breeding as<br>
She is i&#8217; the rear our birth.</p>
<p id="bm532" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm532">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">I cannot say &#8217;tis pity<br>
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress<br>
To most that teach.</p>
<p id="bm533" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm533">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">Your pardon, sir; for this<br>
I&#8217;ll blush you thanks.</p>
<p id="bm534" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm534">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">My prettiest Perdita!<br>
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,<br>
Preserver of my father, now of me,<br>
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?<br>
We are not furnish&#8217;d like Bohemia&#8217;s son,<br>
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.</p>
<p id="bm535" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm535">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes<br>
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care<br>
To have you royally appointed as if<br>
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,<br>
That you may know you shall not want, one word.</p>

<p class="speech">Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust,
his
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
by which means I saw whose purse was best in
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
wenches&#8217; song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
was senseless; &#8217;twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir&#8217;s song,
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
festival purses; and had not the old man come in
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king&#8217;s
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
left a purse alive in the whole army.</p>

<p class="speech">Why, be so still; here&#8217;s nobody will steal

make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
&#8212;thou must think there&#8217;s a necessity
in&#8217;t,&#8212;and

Come home to ye!&#8212;you must retire yourself<br>
Into some covert: take your sweetheart&#8217;s hat<br>
And pluck it o&#8217;er your brows, muffle your face,<br>
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken<br>
The truth of your own seeming; that you may&#8212;<br>
For I do fear eyes over&#8212;to shipboard<br>

Have you done there?</p>
<p id="bm554" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm554">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Should I now meet my father,<br>
He would not call me son.</p>

<p id="bm557" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm557">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!<br>
Pray you, a word.</p>
<p id="bm558" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm558">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What I do
next, shall be to tell the king<br>
Of this escape and whither they are bound;<br>
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail<br>
To force him after: in whose company<br>
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight<br>
I have a woman&#8217;s longing.</p>
<p id="bm559" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm559">Florizel</a></p>

Camillo</span></p>
<p id="bm561" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm561">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I understand the business, I hear it: to have
an
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
What an exchange had this been without boot! What
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
do&#8217;t: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
and therein am I constant to my profession.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Clown and

every lane&#8217;s end, every shop, church, session,
hanging, yields a careful man work.</p>
<p id="bm562" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm562">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">See, see; what a man you are now!
There is no other way but to tell the king
she&#8217;s a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.</p>
<p id="bm563" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm563">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but hear me.</p>

<p class="speech">Nay, but hear me.</p>
<p id="bm565" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm565">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Go to, then.</p>
<p id="bm566" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm566">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">She being none of your flesh and blood, your
flesh
and blood has not offended the king; and so your
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
those things you found about her, those secret
things, all but what she has with her: this being
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.</p>
<p id="bm567" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm567">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and
his
son&#8217;s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
me the king&#8217;s brother-in-law.</p>
<p id="bm568" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm568">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off
you
could have been to him and then your blood had been

<p id="bm575" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm575">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Your affairs there, what, with whom, the
condition
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.</p>
<p id="bm576" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm576">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">We are but plain fellows, sir.</p>
<p id="bm577" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm577">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have
no
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
they do not give us the lie.</p>
<p id="bm578" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm578">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Your worship had like to have given us one, if
you
had not taken yourself with the manner.</p>
<p id="bm579" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm579">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Are you a courtier, an&#8217;t like you, sir?</p>
<p id="bm580" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm580">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier.
Seest
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
open thy affair.</p>
<p id="bm581" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm581">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">My business, sir, is to the king.</p>
<p id="bm582" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm582">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">What advocate hast thou to him?</p>
<p id="bm583" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm583">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">I know not, an&#8217;t like you.</p>
<p id="bm584" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm584">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Advocate&#8217;s the court-word for a pheasant:
say you
have none.</p>
<p id="bm585" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm585">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.</p>
<p id="bm586" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm586">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">How blessed are we that are not simple men!<br>
Yet nature might have made me as these are,<br>
Therefore I will not disdain.</p>
<p id="bm587" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm587">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">This cannot be but a great courtier.</p>
<p id="bm588" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm588">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">His garments are rich, but he wears
them not handsomely.</p>
<p id="bm589" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm589">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">He seems to be the more noble in being
fantastical:
a great man, I&#8217;ll warrant; I know by the picking
on&#8217;s teeth.</p>
<p id="bm590" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm590">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">The fardel there? what&#8217;s i&#8217; the
fardel?<br>
Wherefore that box?</p>
<p id="bm591" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm591">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and
box,
which none must know but the king; and which he
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
speech of him.</p>
<p id="bm592" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm592">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Age, thou hast lost thy labour.</p>
<p id="bm593" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm593">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir?</p>
<p id="bm594" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm594">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard
a
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
know the king is full of grief.</p>
<p id="bm595" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm595">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">So &#8217;tis said, sir; about his son, that
should have
married a shepherd&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p id="bm596" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm596">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him
fly:
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.</p>
<p id="bm597" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm597">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Think you so, sir?</p>
<p id="bm598" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm598">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make
heavy
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</p>
<p id="bm599" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm599">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Has the old man e&#8217;er a son, sir, do you
hear. an&#8217;t
like you, sir?</p>
<p id="bm600" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm600">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
&#8217;nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
wasp&#8217;s nest; then stand till he be three quarters
and a dram dead; then recovered again with
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
are to be smiled at, their offences being so
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
men, what you have to the king: being something
gently considered, I&#8217;ll bring you where he is
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
shall do it.</p>
<p id="bm601" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm601">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">He seems to be of great authority: close with
him,
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
and no more ado. Remember &#8216;stoned,&#8217; and &#8216;flayed
alive.&#8217;</p>
<p id="bm602" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm602">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t please you, sir, to undertake the
business for
us, here is that gold I have: I&#8217;ll make it as much
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.</p>
<p id="bm603" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm603">Autolycus</a></p>

<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p id="bm605" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm605">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this
business?</p>
<p id="bm606" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm606">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">In some sort, sir: but though my case be a
pitiful
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.</p>
<p id="bm607" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm607">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, that&#8217;s the case of the shepherd&#8217;s
son: hang him,
he&#8217;ll be made an example.</p>
<p id="bm608" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm608">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and
show
our strange sights: he must know &#8217;tis none of your
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
will give you as much as this old man does when the
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
pawn till it be brought you.</p>
<p id="bm609" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm609">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I will trust you. Walk before toward the
sea-side;
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
hedge and follow you.</p>
<p id="bm610" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm610">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">We are blest in this man, as I may say, even
blest.</p>
<p id="bm611" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm611">Shepherd</a></p>

would
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
think it fit to shore them again and that the
complaint they have to the king concerns him
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
officious; for I am proof against that title and

them: there may be matter in it.</p>

Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;<br>

Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them<br>

Most sorry, you have broken from his liking<br>

That you might well enjoy her.</p>

Remember since you owed no more to time<br>
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,<br>

Gentleman</span></p>
<p id="bm672" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm672">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this
relation?</p>
<p id="bm673" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm673">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the
old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</p>
<p id="bm674" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm674">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</p>
<p id="bm675" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm675">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I make a broken delivery of the business; but
the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter another
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.<br>
The news, Rogero?</p>
<p id="bm676" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm676">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled;
the
king&#8217;s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a third
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the Lady Paulina&#8217;s steward: he
can
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir?</p>
<p id="bm677" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm677">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you&#8217;ll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione&#8217;s, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king&#8217;s daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?</p>
<p id="bm678" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm678">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p id="bm679" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm679">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Then have you lost a sight, which was to be
seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, cries &#8216;O, thy mother,
thy mother!&#8217; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns. I never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.</p>
<p id="bm680" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm680">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that
carried
hence the child?</p>
<p id="bm681" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm681">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Like an old tale still, which will have matter
to
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd&#8217;s son; who has not only his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</p>
<p id="bm682" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm682">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">What became of his bark and his followers?</p>
<p id="bm683" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm683">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Wrecked the same instant of their master&#8217;s
death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing.</p>
<p id="bm684" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm684">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">The dignity of this act was worth the audience
of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</p>
<p id="bm685" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm685">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">One of the prettiest touches of all and that
which
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen&#8217;s
death, with the manner how she came to&#8217;t bravely
confessed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an &#8216;Alas,&#8217;
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen &#8217;t, the woe had been universal.</p>
<p id="bm686" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm686">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Are they returned to the court?</p>
<p id="bm687" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm687">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">No: the princess hearing of her mother&#8217;s
statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina,&#8212;a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>
<p id="bm688" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm688">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I thought she had some great matter there in
hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?</p>
<p id="bm689" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm689">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who would be thence that has the benefit of
access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let&#8217;s along.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gentlemen</span></p>
<p id="bm690" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm690">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in
me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd&#8217;s daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But &#8217;tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret, it would not

me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</p>
<p id="bm693" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm693">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</p>
<p id="bm694" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm694">Clown</a></p>

<p id="bm696" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm696">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">So you have: but I was a gentleman born before
my
father; for the king&#8217;s son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.</p>
<p id="bm697" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm697">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">We may live, son, to shed many more.</p>
<p id="bm698" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm698">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay; or else &#8217;twere hard luck, being in
so
preposterous estate as we are.</p>
<p id="bm699" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm699">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all
the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.</p>
<p id="bm700" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm700">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we
are
gentlemen.</p>
<p id="bm701" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm701">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou wilt amend thy life?</p>
<p id="bm702" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm702">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, an it like your good worship.</p>
<p id="bm703" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm703">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince
thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</p>
<p id="bm704" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm704">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">You may say it, but not swear it.</p>
<p id="bm705" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm705">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors
and
franklins say it, I&#8217;ll swear it.</p>
<p id="bm706" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm706">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">How if it be false, son?</p>
<p id="bm707" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm707">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">If it be ne&#8217;er so false, a true gentleman
may swear
it in the behalf of his friend: and I&#8217;ll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I&#8217;ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.</p>
<p id="bm708" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm708">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I will prove so, sir, to my power.</p>
<p id="bm709" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm709">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do
not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen&#8217;s picture. Come, follow us: we&#8217;ll be thy
good masters.</p>

<h4>Scene III. A chapel in Paulina&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Leontes, Polixenes,
Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p id="bm710" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm710">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort<br>
That I have had of thee!</p>
<p id="bm711" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm711">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, sovereign sir,<br>
I did not well I meant well. All my services<br>
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,<br>
With your crown&#8217;d brother and these your contracted<br>
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,<br>
It is a surplus of your grace, which never<br>
My life may last to answer.</p>
<p id="bm712" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm712">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O Paulina,<br>
We honour you with trouble: but we came<br>
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery<br>
Have we pass&#8217;d through, not without much content<br>
In many singularities; but we saw not<br>
That which my daughter came to look upon,<br>
The statue of her mother.</p>
<p id="bm713" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm713">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">As she lived peerless,<br>
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,<br>
Excels whatever yet you look&#8217;d upon<br>
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it<br>
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare<br>
To see the life as lively mock&#8217;d as ever<br>
Still sleep mock&#8217;d death: behold, and say &#8217;tis
well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Paulina draws a curtain, and
discovers Hermione standing like a statue</span></p>
<p class="speech">I like your silence, it the more shows off<br>
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,<br>
Comes it not something near?</p>
<p id="bm714" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm714">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Her natural posture!<br>
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed<br>
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she<br>
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender<br>
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,<br>
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing<br>
So aged as this seems.</p>
<p id="bm715" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm715">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, not by much.</p>
<p id="bm716" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm716">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">So much the more our carver&#8217;s
excellence;<br>
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her<br>
As she lived now.</p>
<p id="bm717" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm717">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;As now she might have done,<br>
So much to my good comfort, as it is<br>
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,<br>
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,<br>
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo&#8217;d her!<br>
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me<br>
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,<br>
There&#8217;s magic in thy majesty, which has<br>
My evils conjured to remembrance and<br>
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,<br>
Standing like stone with thee.</p>
<p id="bm718" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm718">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">And give me leave,<br>
And do not say &#8217;tis superstition, that<br>
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,<br>
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,<br>
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</p>
<p id="bm719" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm719">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, patience!<br>
The statue is but newly fix&#8217;d, the colour&#8217;s<br>
Not dry.</p>
<p id="bm720" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm720">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,<br>
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,<br>
So many summers dry; scarce any joy<br>
Did ever so long live; no sorrow<br>
But kill&#8217;d itself much sooner.</p>
<p id="bm721" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm721">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Dear my brother,<br>
Let him that was the cause of this have power<br>
To take off so much grief from you as he<br>
Will piece up in himself.</p>
<p id="bm722" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm722">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord,<br>
If I had thought the sight of my poor image<br>
Would thus have wrought you,&#8212;for the stone is mine&#8212;<br>
I&#8217;ld not have show&#8217;d it.</p>
<p id="bm723" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm723">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Do not draw the curtain.</p>
<p id="bm724" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm724">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">No longer shall you gaze on&#8217;t, lest your
fancy<br>
May think anon it moves.</p>
<p id="bm725" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm725">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let be, let be.<br>
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already&#8212;<br>
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,<br>
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins<br>
Did verily bear blood?</p>
<p id="bm726" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm726">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Masterly done:<br>
The very life seems warm upon her lip.</p>
<p id="bm727" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm727">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">The fixture of her eye has motion in&#8217;t,<br>
As we are mock&#8217;d with art.</p>
<p id="bm728" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm728">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll draw the curtain:<br>
My lord&#8217;s almost so far transported that<br>
He&#8217;ll think anon it lives.</p>
<p id="bm729" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm729">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O sweet Paulina,<br>
Make me to think so twenty years together!<br>
No settled senses of the world can match<br>
The pleasure of that madness. Let &#8217;t alone.</p>
<p id="bm730" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm730">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr&#8217;d
you: but<br>
I could afflict you farther.</p>
<p id="bm731" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm731">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Do, Paulina;<br>
For this affliction has a taste as sweet<br>
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,<br>
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel<br>
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<br>
For I will kiss her.</p>
<p id="bm732" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm732">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, forbear:<br>
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;<br>
You&#8217;ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own<br>
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</p>
<p id="bm733" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm733">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, not these twenty years.</p>
<p id="bm734" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm734">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">So long could I<br>
Stand by, a looker on.</p>
<p id="bm735" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm735">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Either forbear,<br>
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you<br>
For more amazement. If you can behold it,<br>
I&#8217;ll make the statue move indeed, descend<br>
And take you by the hand; but then you&#8217;ll think&#8212;<br>
Which I protest against&#8212;I am assisted<br>
By wicked powers.</p>
<p id="bm736" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm736">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What you can make her do,<br>
I am content to look on: what to speak,<br>
I am content to hear; for &#8217;tis as easy<br>
To make her speak as move.</p>
<p id="bm737" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm737">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is required<br>
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;<br>
On: those that think it is unlawful business<br>
I am about, let them depart.</p>
<p id="bm738" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm738">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Proceed:<br>
No foot shall stir.</p>
<p id="bm739" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm739">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Music, awake her; strike!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis time; descend; be stone no more;
approach;<br>
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,<br>
I&#8217;ll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,<br>
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<br>
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hermione comes
down</span></p>
<p class="speech">Start not; her actions shall be holy as<br>
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her<br>
Until you see her die again; for then<br>
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:<br>
When she was young you woo&#8217;d her; now in age<br>
Is she become the suitor?</p>
<p id="bm740" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm740">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, she&#8217;s warm!<br>
If this be magic, let it be an art<br>
Lawful as eating.</p>
<p id="bm741" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm741">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;She embraces him.</p>
<p id="bm742" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm742">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">She hangs about his neck:<br>
If she pertain to life let her speak too.</p>
<p id="bm743" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm743">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and make&#8217;t manifest where she has
lived,<br>
Or how stolen from the dead.</p>
<p id="bm744" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm744">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">That she is living,<br>
Were it but told you, should be hooted at<br>
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,<br>
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.<br>
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel<br>
And pray your mother&#8217;s blessing. Turn, good lady;<br>
Our Perdita is found.</p>
<p id="bm745" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm745">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">You gods, look down<br>
And from your sacred vials pour your graces<br>
Upon my daughter&#8217;s head! Tell me, mine own.<br>
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found<br>
Thy father&#8217;s court? for thou shalt hear that I,<br>
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle<br>
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved<br>
Myself to see the issue.</p>
<p id="bm746" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm746">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s time enough for that;<br>
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble<br>
Your joys with like relation. Go together,<br>
You precious winners all; your exultation<br>
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,<br>
Will wing me to some wither&#8217;d bough and there<br>
My mate, that&#8217;s never to be found again,<br>
Lament till I am lost.</p>
<p id="bm747" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm747">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, peace, Paulina!<br>
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<br>
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,<br>
And made between&#8217;s by vows. Thou hast found mine;<br>
But how, is to be question&#8217;d; for I saw her,<br>
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<br>
A prayer upon her grave. I&#8217;ll not seek far&#8212;<br>
For him, I partly know his mind&#8212;to find thee<br>
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,<br>
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<br>
Is richly noted and here justified<br>
By us, a pair of kings. Let&#8217;s from this place.<br>
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,<br>
That e&#8217;er I put between your holy looks<br>
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,<br>
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,<br>
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,<br>
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<br>
Each one demand an answer to his part<br>
Perform&#8217;d in this wide gap of time since first<br>
We were dissever&#8217;d: hastily lead away.</p>
