<h4>Scene I. Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter York, and his army of
Irish, with drum and colours</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">From Ireland thus comes York to claim his
right,<br>
And pluck the crown from feeble Henry&#8217;s head:<br>
Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,<br>
To entertain great England&#8217;s lawful king.<br>
Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?<br>
Let them obey that know not how to rule;<br>
This hand was made to handle naught but gold.<br>
I cannot give due action to my words,<br>
Except a sword or sceptre balance it:<br>
A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,<br>
On which I&#8217;ll toss the flower-de-luce of France.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Buckingham</span></p>
<p class="speech">Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?<br>
The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee
well.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy
greeting.<br>
Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,<br>
To know the reason of these arms in peace;<br>
Or why thou, being a subject as I am,<br>
Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,<br>
Should raise so great a power without his leave,<br>
Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Scarce can I
speak, my choler is so great:<br>
O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,<br>
I am so angry at these abject terms;<br>
And now, like Ajax Telamonius,<br>
On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.<br>
I am far better born than is the king,<br>
More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:<br>
But I must make fair weather yet a while,<br>
Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,&#8212;<br>
Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,<br>
That I have given no answer all this while;<br>
My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.<br>
The cause why I have brought this army hither<br>
Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,<br>
Seditious to his grace and to the state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">That is too much presumption on thy part:<br>
But if thy arms be to no other end,<br>
The king hath yielded unto thy demand:<br>
The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.<br>
Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;<br>
Meet me to-morrow in St. George&#8217;s field,<br>
You shall have pay and every thing you wish.<br>
And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,<br>
Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,<br>
As pledges of my fealty and love;<br>
I&#8217;ll send them all as willing as I live:<br>
Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,<br>
Is his to use, so Somerset may die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">York, I commend this kind submission:<br>
We twain will go into his highness&#8217; tent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry VI and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,<br>
That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">In all submission and humility<br>
York doth present himself unto your highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Then what intends these forces thou dost
bring?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,<br>
And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,<br>
Who since I heard to be discomfited.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Iden, with Cade&#8217;s
head</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">If one so rude and of so mean condition<br>
May pass into the presence of a king,<br>
Lo, I present your grace a traitor&#8217;s head,<br>
The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">The head of Cade! Great God, how just art
Thou!<br>
O, let me view his visage, being dead,<br>
That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.<br>
Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">I was, an&#8217;t like your majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">How art thou call&#8217;d? and what is thy
degree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">Alexander Iden, that&#8217;s my name;<br>
A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Buckingham</p>
<p class="speech">So please it you, my lord, &#8217;twere not
amiss<br>
He were created knight for his good service.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Iden, kneel down.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He kneels</span></p>
<p class="speech">Rise up a knight.<br>
We give thee for reward a thousand marks,<br>
And will that thou henceforth attend on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Iden</p>
<p class="speech">May Iden live to merit such a bounty.<br>
And never live but true unto his liege!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Rises</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Margaret and
Somerset</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the
queen:<br>
Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his
head,<br>
But boldly stand and front him to his face.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">How now! is Somerset at liberty?<br>
Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison&#8217;d thoughts,<br>
And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.<br>
Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?<br>
False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,<br>
Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?<br>
King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,<br>
Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,<br>
Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.<br>
That head of thine doth not become a crown;<br>
Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer&#8217;s staff,<br>
And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.<br>
That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,<br>
Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles&#8217; spear,<br>
Is able with the change to kill and cure.<br>
Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up<br>
And with the same to act controlling laws.<br>
Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more<br>
O&#8217;er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Somerset</p>
<p class="speech">O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,<br>
Of capital treason &#8217;gainst the king and crown;<br>
Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of
these,<br>
If they can brook I bow a knee to man.<br>
Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">I know, ere they will have me go to ward,<br>
They&#8217;ll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,<br>
To say if that the bastard boys of York<br>
Shall be the surety for their traitor father.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Buckingham</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">O blood-besotted Neapolitan,<br>
Outcast of Naples, England&#8217;s bloody scourge!<br>
The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,<br>
Shall be their father&#8217;s bail; and bane to those<br>
That for my surety will refuse the boys!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edward and
Richard</span></p>
<p class="speech">See where they come: I&#8217;ll warrant
they&#8217;ll
make it good.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clifford and Young
Clifford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Health and all happiness to my lord the king!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneels</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with
thee?<br>
Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;<br>
We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;<br>
For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">This is my king, York, I do not mistake;<br>
But thou mistakest me much to think I do:<br>
To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour<br>
Makes him oppose himself against his king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,<br>
And chop away that factious pate of his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">He is arrested, but will not obey;<br>
His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Will you not, sons?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">And if words will not, then our weapons
shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Look in a glass, and call thy image so:<br>
I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.<br>
Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,<br>
That with the very shaking of their chains<br>
They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:<br>
Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Warwick and
Salisbury</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Are these thy bears? we&#8217;ll bait thy bears
to death.<br>
And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,<br>
If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Oft have I seen a hot o&#8217;erweening cur<br>
Run back and bite, because he was withheld;<br>
Who, being suffer&#8217;d with the bear&#8217;s fell paw,<br>
Hath clapp&#8217;d his tail between his legs and cried:<br>
And such a piece of service will you do,<br>
If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,<br>
As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Take heed, lest by your heat you burn
yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?<br>
Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,<br>
Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!<br>
What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,<br>
And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?<br>
O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?<br>
If it be banish&#8217;d from the frosty head,<br>
Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?<br>
Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,<br>
And shame thine honourable age with blood?<br>
Why art thou old, and want&#8217;st experience?<br>
Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?<br>
For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me<br>
That bows unto the grave with mickle age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I have consider&#8217;d with myself<br>
The title of this most renowned duke;<br>
And in my conscience do repute his grace<br>
The rightful heir to England&#8217;s royal seat.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an
oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salisbury</p>
<p class="speech">It is great sin to swear unto a sin,<br>
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.<br>
Who can be bound by any solemn vow<br>
To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,<br>
To force a spotless virgin&#8217;s chastity,<br>
To reave the orphan of his patrimony,<br>
To wring the widow from her custom&#8217;d right,<br>
And have no other reason for this wrong<br>
But that he was bound by a solemn oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">A subtle traitor needs no sophister.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou
hast,<br>
I am resolved for death or dignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">You were best to go to bed and dream again,<br>
To keep thee from the tempest of the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">I am resolved to bear a greater storm<br>
Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;<br>
And that I&#8217;ll write upon thy burgonet,<br>
Might I but know thee by thy household badge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by my father&#8217;s badge, old
Nevil&#8217;s crest,<br>
The rampant bear chain&#8217;d to the ragged staff,<br>
This day I&#8217;ll wear aloft my burgonet,<br>
As on a mountain top the cedar shows<br>
That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,<br>
Even to affright thee with the view thereof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">And from thy burgonet I&#8217;ll rend thy
bear<br>
And tread it under foot with all contempt,<br>
Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">And so to arms, victorious father,<br>
To quell the rebels and their complices.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,<br>
For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Foul stigmatic, that&#8217;s more than thou canst
tell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">If not in heaven, you&#8217;ll surely sup in
hell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt severally</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. Saint Alban&#8217;s.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarums to the battle. Enter
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Clifford of Cumberland, &#8217;tis Warwick
calls:<br>
And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,<br>
Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum<br>
And dead men&#8217;s cries do fill the empty air,<br>
Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:<br>
Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,<br>
Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter York</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,<br>
But match to match I have encounter&#8217;d him<br>
And made a prey for carrion kites and crows<br>
Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Clifford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Of one or both of us the time is come.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other
chase,<br>
For I myself must hunt this deer to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Then, nobly, York; &#8217;tis for a crown thou
fight&#8217;st.<br>
As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,<br>
It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou
pause?</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">With thy brave bearing should I be in love,<br>
But that thou art so fast mine enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Nor should thy prowess want praise and
esteem,<br>
But that &#8217;tis shown ignobly and in treason.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">So let it help me now against thy sword<br>
As I in justice and true right express it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">My soul and body on the action both!</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.</p>

Clifford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Young Clifford</p>
<p class="speech">Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;<br>
Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds<br>
Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,<br>
Whom angry heavens do make their minister<br>
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part<br>
Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.<br>
He that is truly dedicate to war<br>
Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself<br>
Hath not essentially but by circumstance<br>
The name of valour.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Seeing his dead
father</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, let the vile world end,<br>
And the premised flames of the last day<br>
Knit earth and heaven together!<br>
Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,<br>
Particularities and petty sounds<br>
To cease! Wast thou ordain&#8217;d, dear father,<br>
To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve<br>
The silver livery of advised age,<br>
And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus<br>
To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight<br>
My heart is turn&#8217;d to stone: and while &#8217;tis mine,<br>
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;<br>
No more will I their babes: tears virginal<br>
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,<br>
And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims<br>
Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.<br>
Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:<br>
Meet I an infant of the house of York,<br>
Into as many gobbets will I cut it<br>
As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:<br>
In cruelty will I seek out my fame.<br>
Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford&#8217;s house:<br>
As did Aeneas old Anchises bear,<br>
So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;<br>
But then Aeneas bare a living load,<br>
Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.</p>

<p class="speech">So, lie thou there;<br>
For underneath an alehouse&#8217; paltry sign,<br>
The Castle in Saint Alban&#8217;s, Somerset<br>
Hath made the wizard famous in his death.<br>
Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:<br>
Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.</p>

<p class="speech">What are you made of? you&#8217;ll nor fight nor

Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,<br>
To give the enemy way, and to secure us<br>
By what we can, which can no more but fly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Alarum afar off</span></p>
<p class="speech">If you be ta&#8217;en, we then should see the
bottom<br>
Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,<br>
As well we may, if not through your neglect,<br>
We shall to London get, where you are loved<br>
And where this breach now in our fortunes made<br>
May readily be stopp&#8217;d.</p>

set,<br>
I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:<br>
But fly you must; uncurable discomfit<br>
Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.<br>
Away, for your relief! and we will live<br>
To see their day and them our fortune give:<br>
Away, my lord, away!</p>

Richard, Warwick, and Soldiers, with drum and colours</span></p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">Of Salisbury, who can report of him,<br>
That winter lion, who in rage forgets<br>
Aged contusions and all brush of time,<br>
And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,<br>
Repairs him with occasion? This happy day<br>
Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,<br>
If Salisbury be lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Richard</p>
<p class="speech">My noble father,<br>
Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,<br>
Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,<br>
Persuaded him from any further act:<br>
But still, where danger was, still there I met him;<br>

You have defended me from imminent death.<br>
Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:<br>
&#8217;Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,<br>
Being opposites of such repairing nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">York</p>
<p class="speech">I know our safety is to follow them;<br>
For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,<br>
To call a present court of parliament.<br>
Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.<br>
What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">After them! nay, before them, if we can.<br>
Now, by my faith, lords, &#8217;twas a glorious day:<br>
Saint Alban&#8217;s battle won by famous York<br>
Shall be eternized in all age to come.<br>
Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:<br>
And more such days as these to us befall!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
