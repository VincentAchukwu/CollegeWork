<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Poet, Painter,
Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Good day, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I am glad you&#8217;re well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I have not seen you long: how goes the world?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">It wears, sir, as it grows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that&#8217;s well known:<br>
But what particular rarity? what strange,<br>
Which manifold record not matches? See,<br>
Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power<br>
Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I know them both; th&#8217; other&#8217;s a
jeweller.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">O, &#8217;tis a worthy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s most fix&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">A most incomparable man, breathed, as it
were,<br>
To an untirable and continuate goodness:<br>
He passes.<br>
Jeweller: I have a jewel here&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">O, pray, let&#8217;s see&#8217;t: for the Lord
Timon, sir?<br>
Jeweller: If he will touch the estimate: but, for that&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reciting to himself]</span>
&#8216;When we for recompense have
praised the vile,<br>
It stains the glory in that happy verse<br>
Which aptly sings the good.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a good form.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Looking at the
jewel</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">And rich: here is a water, look ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">You are rapt, sir, in some work, some
dedication<br>
To the great lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A thing slipp&#8217;d idly from
me.<br>
Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes<br>
From whence &#8217;tis nourish&#8217;d: the fire i&#8217; the
flint<br>
Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame<br>
Provokes itself and like the current flies<br>
Each bound it chafes. What have you there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.<br>
Let&#8217;s see your piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a good piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">So &#8217;tis: this comes off well and
excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Indifferent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Admirable: how this grace<br>
Speaks his own standing! what a mental power<br>
This eye shoots forth! how big imagination<br>
Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture<br>
One might interpret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">It is a pretty mocking of the life.<br>
Here is a touch; is&#8217;t good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I will say of it,<br>
It tutors nature: artificial strife<br>
Lives in these touches, livelier than life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter certain Senators, and
pass over</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">How this lord is follow&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Athens: happy man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Look, more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">You see this confluence, this great flood
of visitors.<br>
I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,<br>
Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug<br>
With amplest entertainment: my free drift<br>
Halts not particularly, but moves itself<br>
In a wide sea of wax: no levell&#8217;d malice<br>
Infects one comma in the course I hold;<br>
But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,<br>
Leaving no tract behind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">How shall I understand you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I will unbolt to you.<br>
You see how all conditions, how all minds,<br>
As well of glib and slippery creatures as<br>
Of grave and austere quality, tender down<br>
Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune<br>
Upon his good and gracious nature hanging<br>
Subdues and properties to his love and tendance<br>
All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer<br>
To Apemantus, that few things loves better<br>
Than to abhor himself: even he drops down<br>
The knee before him, and returns in peace<br>
Most rich in Timon&#8217;s nod.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I saw them speak together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill<br>
Feign&#8217;d Fortune to be throned: the base o&#8217; the
mount<br>
Is rank&#8217;d with all deserts, all kind of natures,<br>
That labour on the bosom of this sphere<br>
To propagate their states: amongst them all,<br>
Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix&#8217;d,<br>
One do I personate of Lord Timon&#8217;s frame,<br>
Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;<br>
Whose present grace to present slaves and servants<br>
Translates his rivals.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis conceived to scope.<br>
This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,<br>
With one man beckon&#8217;d from the rest below,<br>
Bowing his head against the sleepy mount<br>
To climb his happiness, would be well express&#8217;d<br>
In our condition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, sir, but hear me on.<br>
All those which were his fellows but of late,<br>
Some better than his value, on the moment<br>
Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,<br>
Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,<br>
Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him<br>
Drink the free air.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, what of these?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">When Fortune in her shift and change of mood<br>
Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants<br>
Which labour&#8217;d after him to the mountain&#8217;s top<br>
Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,<br>
Not one accompanying his declining foot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis common:<br>
A thousand moral paintings I can show<br>
That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune&#8217;s<br>
More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well<br>
To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen<br>
The foot above the head.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sound. Enter Timon,
addressing himself courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
Ventidius talking with him; Lucilius and other servants
following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Imprison&#8217;d is he, say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,<br>
His means most short, his creditors most strait:<br>
Your honourable letter he desires<br>
To those have shut him up; which failing,<br>
Periods his comfort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Ventidius! Well;<br>
I am not of that feather to shake off<br>
My friend when he must need me. I do know him<br>
A gentleman that well deserves a help:<br>
Which he shall have: I&#8217;ll pay the debt,
and free him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship ever binds him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;<br>
And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.<br>
&#8217;Tis not enough to help the feeble up,<br>
But to support him after. Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">All happiness to your honour!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an old
Athenian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Lord Timon, hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Freely, good father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I have so: what of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Here, at your lordship&#8217;s service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy
creature,<br>
By night frequents my house. I am a man<br>
That from my first have been inclined to thrift;<br>
And my estate deserves an heir more raised<br>
Than one which holds a trencher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well; what further?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">One only daughter have I, no kin else,<br>
On whom I may confer what I have got:<br>
The maid is fair, o&#8217; the youngest for a bride,<br>
And I have bred her at my dearest cost<br>
In qualities of the best. This man of thine<br>
Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,<br>
Join with me to forbid him her resort;<br>
Myself have spoke in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">The man is honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore he will be, Timon:<br>
His honesty rewards him in itself;<br>
It must not bear my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Does she love him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">She is young and apt:<br>
Our own precedent passions do instruct us<br>
What levity&#8217;s in youth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Lucilius]</span> Love you
the maid?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">If in her marriage my consent be missing,<br>
I call the gods to witness, I will choose<br>
Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,<br>
And dispossess her all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How shall she be endow&#8217;d,
if she be mated with an equal husband?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Three talents on the present; in future, all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">This gentleman of mine hath served me long:<br>
To build his fortune I will strain a little,<br>
For &#8217;tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:<br>
What you bestow, in him I&#8217;ll counterpoise,<br>
And make him weigh with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Athenian</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble lord,<br>
Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Humbly I thank your lordship: never may<br>
The state or fortune fall into my keeping,<br>
Which is not owed to you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucilius and Old
Athenian</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your
lordship!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:<br>
Go not away. What have you there, my friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">A piece of painting, which I do beseech<br>
Your lordship to accept.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Painting is welcome.<br>
The painting is almost the natural man;<br>
or since dishonour traffics with man&#8217;s nature,<br>
He is but outside: these pencill&#8217;d figures are<br>
Even such as they give out. I like your work;<br>
And you shall find I like it: wait attendance<br>
Till you hear further from me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">The gods preserve ye!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;<br>
We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel<br>
Hath suffer&#8217;d under praise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">What, my lord! dispraise?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">A more satiety of commendations.<br>
If I should pay you for&#8217;t as &#8217;tis extoll&#8217;d,<br>
It would unclew me quite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jeweller</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, &#8217;tis rated<br>
As those which sell would give: but you well know,<br>
Things of like value differing in the owners<br>
Are prized by their masters: believe&#8217;t, dear lord,<br>
You mend the jewel by the wearing it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well mock&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; he speaks the common
tongue,<br>
Which all men speak with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Look, who comes here: will you be chid?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Apemantus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Jeweller: We&#8217;ll bear, with your
lordship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;ll spare none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good
morrow;<br>
When thou art Timon&#8217;s dog, and these knaves honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou call them knaves? thou
know&#8217;st them not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Are they not Athenians?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Then I repent not.<br>
Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st I do: I call&#8217;d thee by
thy name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art proud, Apemantus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Of nothing so much as that I am not like
Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Whither art going?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">To knock out an honest Athenian&#8217;s
brains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a deed thou&#8217;lt die for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">The best, for the innocence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wrought he not well that painted it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">He wrought better that made the painter; and
yet
he&#8217;s but a filthy piece of work.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re a dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thy mother&#8217;s of my generation: what&#8217;s
she, if I be a dog?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No; I eat not lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">An thou shouldst, thou &#8217;ldst anger
ladies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">O, they eat lords; so they come by great
bellies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a lascivious apprehension.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy
labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost
a
man a doit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou think &#8217;tis worth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">How now, philosopher!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Art not one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Then I lie not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>

<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where
thou
hast feigned him a worthy fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not feigned; he is so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for
thy
labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o&#8217;
the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst do then, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord
with my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What, thyself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">That I had no angry wit to be a lord.<br>
Art not thou a merchant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Apemantus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!</p>
<p class="speaker">Merchant</p>
<p class="speech">If traffic do it, the gods do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Traffic&#8217;s thy god; and thy god confound
thee!</p>

<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What trumpet&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,<br>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt some
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">You must needs dine with me: go not you hence<br>
Till I have thank&#8217;d you: when dinner&#8217;s done,<br>
Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Alcibiades, with the
rest</span></p>
<p class="speech">Most welcome, sir!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;So, so, there!<br>
Aches contract and starve your supple joints!<br>
That there should be small love &#8217;mongst these
sweet knaves,<br>
And all this courtesy! The strain of man&#8217;s bred out<br>
Into baboon and monkey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed<br>
Most hungerly on your sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Right welcome, sir!<br>
Ere we depart, we&#8217;ll share a bounteous time<br>
In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except
Apemantus</span></p>

<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">What time o&#8217; day is&#8217;t, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Time to be honest.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">That time serves still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">The more accursed thou, that still omitt&#8217;st
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art going to Lord Timon&#8217;s feast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat
fools.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well, fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean
to
give thee none.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Hang thyself!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make
thy
requests to thy friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Away, unpeaceable dog, or I&#8217;ll spurn thee
hence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I will fly, like a dog, the heels o&#8217; the
ass.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s opposite to humanity. Come, shall we
in,<br>
And taste Lord Timon&#8217;s bounty? he outgoes<br>
The very heart of kindness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,<br>
Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays<br>
Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,<br>
But breeds the giver a return exceeding<br>
All use of quittance.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">The noblest mind he carries<br>
That ever govern&#8217;d man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hautboys playing loud music.
A great banquet served in; Flavius and others attending; then enter
Timon, Alcibiades, Lords, Senators, and Ventidius. Then comes,
dropping, after all, Apemantus, discontentedly, like
himself</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">Most honour&#8217;d Timon,<br>
It hath pleased the gods to remember my father&#8217;s age,<br>
And call him to long peace.<br>
He is gone happy, and has left me rich:<br>
Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound<br>
To your free heart, I do return those talents,<br>
Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help<br>
I derived liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, by no means,<br>
Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:<br>
I gave it freely ever; and there&#8217;s none<br>
Can truly say he gives, if he receives:<br>
If our betters play at that game, we must not dare<br>
To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">A noble spirit!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nay, my lords,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They all stand ceremoniously
looking on Timon</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ceremony was but devised at first<br>
To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,<br>
Recanting goodness, sorry ere &#8217;tis shown;<br>
But where there is true friendship, there needs none.<br>
Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes<br>
Than my fortunes to me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They sit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we always have confess&#8217;d it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, ho, confess&#8217;d it! hang&#8217;d it, have
you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">O, Apemantus, you are welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No;<br>
You shall not make me welcome:<br>
I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, thou&#8217;rt a churl; ye&#8217;ve got a
humour there<br>
Does not become a man: &#8217;tis much to blame.<br>
They say, my lords, &#8216;ira furor brevis est;&#8217; but
yond
man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
he fit for&#8217;t, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come
to
observe; I give thee warning on&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I take no heed of thee; thou&#8217;rt an
Athenian,
therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
prithee, let my meat make thee silent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I scorn thy meat; &#8217;twould choke me, for I
should
ne&#8217;er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
men eat Timon, and he sees &#8217;em not! It grieves me
to see so many dip their meat in one man&#8217;s blood;
and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.<br>
I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:<br>
Methinks they should invite them without knives;<br>
Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.<br>
There&#8217;s much example for&#8217;t; the fellow that sits
next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
man to kill him: &#8217;t has been proved. If I were a
huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;<br>
Lest they should spy my windpipe&#8217;s dangerous notes:<br>
Great men should drink with harness on their throats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, in heart; and let the health go
round.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Let it flow this way, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his
tides
well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
look ill, Timon. Here&#8217;s that which is too weak to
be a sinner, honest water, which ne&#8217;er left man i&#8217; the
mire:<br>
This and my food are equals; there&#8217;s no odds:<br>
Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.<br>
Apemantus&#8217; grace.<br>
Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;<br>
I pray for no man but myself:<br>
Grant I may never prove so fond,<br>
To trust man on his oath or bond;<br>
Or a harlot, for her weeping;<br>
Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:<br>
Or a keeper with my freedom;<br>
Or my friends, if I should need &#8217;em.<br>
Amen. So fall to&#8217;t:<br>
Rich men sin, and I eat root.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Eats and drinks</span></p>
<p class="speech">Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Captain Alcibiades, your heart&#8217;s in the
field now.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">My heart is ever at your service, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than
a
dinner of friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there&#8217;s
no meat
like &#8217;em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Would all those fatterers were thine enemies
then,
that then thou mightst kill &#8217;em and bid me to &#8217;em!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that
you
would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
for ever perfect.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
themselves have provided that I shall have much help
from you: how had you been my friends else? why
have you that charitable title from thousands, did
not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
more of you to myself than you can with modesty
speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
friends, if we should ne&#8217;er have need of &#8217;em? they
were the most needless creatures living, should we
ne&#8217;er have use for &#8217;em, and would most resemble
sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
are born to do benefits: and what better or
properer can we can our own than the riches of our
friends? O, what a precious comfort &#8217;tis, to have
so many, like brothers, commanding one another&#8217;s
fortunes! O joy, e&#8217;en made away ere &#8217;t can be born!
Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
forget their faults, I drink to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Lord</p>
<p class="speech">Joy had the like conception in our eyes<br>
And at that instant like a babe sprung up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Much!</p>

To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th&#8217; ear,<br>
Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;<br>
They only now come but to feast thine eyes.</p>

playing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this
way!<br>
They dance! they are mad women.<br>
Like madness is the glory of this life.<br>
As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.<br>
We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;<br>
And spend our flatteries, to drink those men<br>
Upon whose age we void it up again,<br>
With poisonous spite and envy.<br>
Who lives that&#8217;s not depraved or depraves?<br>
Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves<br>
Of their friends&#8217; gift?<br>
I should fear those that dance before me now<br>
Would one day stamp upon me: &#8217;t has been done;<br>
Men shut their doors against a setting sun.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Lords rise from table,
with much adoring of Timon; and to show their loves, each singles
out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two
to the hautboys, and cease</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You have done our pleasures much grace, fair
ladies,<br>
Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,<br>
Which was not half so beautiful and kind;<br>
You have added worth unto &#8217;t and lustre,<br>

two brace of greyhounds.</p>

Not without fair reward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What will this

He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,<br>
And all out of an empty coffer:<br>
Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,<br>
To show him what a beggar his heart is,<br>
Being of no power to make his wishes good:<br>
His promises fly so beyond his state<br>
That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes<br>
For every word: he is so kind that he now<br>
Pays interest for &#8217;t; his land&#8217;s put to their
books.<br>
Well, would I were gently put out of office<br>
Before I were forced out!<br>
Happier is he that has no friend to feed<br>

So kind to heart, &#8217;tis not enough to give;<br>
Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,<br>
And ne&#8217;er be weary. Alcibiades,<br>
Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;<br>
It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living<br>

Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!<br>
I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums<br>
That are given for &#8217;em. Friendship&#8217;s full of dregs:<br>
Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,<br>
Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court&#8217;sies.</p>

<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll nothing: for if I should be bribed
too,
there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and

But must not break my back to heal his finger;<br>
Immediate are my needs, and my relief<br>
Must not be toss&#8217;d and turn&#8217;d to me in words,<br>

Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;<br>
Yea, &#8217;gainst the authority of manners, pray&#8217;d you<br>
To hold your hand more close: I did endure<br>
Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have<br>

Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!<br>

To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;<br>

<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">Your lordship speaks your pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucullus</p>
<p class="speech">I have observed thee always for a towardly
prompt
spirit&#8212;give thee thy due&#8212;and one that knows what
belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
the time use thee well: good parts in thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Get you gone, sirrah.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord&#8217;s
a
bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
bare friendship, without security. Here&#8217;s three
solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">Is&#8217;t possible the world should so much
differ,<br>
And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,<br>
To him that worships thee!</p>

<p class="speaker">Flaminius</p>
<p class="speech">May these add to the number that may scald
thee!<br>
Let moulten coin be thy damnation,<br>
Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!<br>
Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,<br>
It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,<br>
I feel master&#8217;s passion! this slave,<br>
Unto his honour, has my lord&#8217;s meat in him:<br>
Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,<br>
When he is turn&#8217;d to poison?<br>
O, may diseases only work upon&#8217;t!<br>
And, when he&#8217;s sick to death, let not that part of nature<br>
Which my lord paid for, be of any power<br>
To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!</p>

Strangers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend,
and
an honourable gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">We know him for no less, though we are but
strangers
to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon&#8217;s
happy hours are done and past, and his estate
shrinks from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for
money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">But believe you this, my lord, that, not long
ago,
one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
so many talents, nay, urged extremely for&#8217;t and
showed what necessity belonged to&#8217;t, and yet was denied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">How!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you, denied, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">What a strange case was that! now, before the
gods,
I am ashamed on&#8217;t. Denied that honourable man!
there was very little honour showed in&#8217;t. For my own
part, I must needs confess, I have received some
small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
ne&#8217;er have denied his occasion so many talents.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Servilius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">See, by good hap, yonder&#8217;s my lord;<br>
I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lucius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee
well:
commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
exquisite friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">May it please your honour, my lord hath
sent&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared
to
that lord; he&#8217;s ever sending: how shall I thank
him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Has only sent his present occasion now, my
lord;
requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
with so many talents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">I know his lordship is but merry with me;<br>
He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.<br>
If his occasion were not virtuous,<br>
I should not urge it half so faithfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my soul,&#8217;tis true, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish
myself
against such a good time, when I might ha&#8217; shown
myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
should purchase the day before for a little part,
and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
before the gods, I am not able to do,&#8212;the more
beast, I say:&#8212;I was sending to use Lord Timon
myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done&#8217;t now.
Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
this from me, I count it one of my greatest
afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servilius</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir, I shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucilius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll look you out a good turn,
Servilius.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Servilius</span></p>
<p class="speech">True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;<br>
And he that&#8217;s once denied will hardly speed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Do you observe this, Hostilius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, too well.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is the world&#8217;s soul; and just of
the
same piece<br>
Is every flatterer&#8217;s spirit. Who can call him<br>
His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in<br>
My knowing, Timon has been this lord&#8217;s father,<br>
And kept his credit with his purse,<br>
Supported his estate; nay, Timon&#8217;s money<br>
Has paid his men their wages: he ne&#8217;er drinks,<br>
But Timon&#8217;s silver treads upon his lip;<br>
And yet&#8212;O, see the monstrousness of man<br>
When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!&#8212;<br>
He does deny him, in respect of his,<br>
What charitable men afford to beggars.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">Religion groans at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Stranger</p>
<p class="speech">For mine own part,<br>
I never tasted Timon in my life,<br>
Nor came any of his bounties over me,<br>
To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,<br>
For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue<br>
And honourable carriage,<br>
Had his necessity made use of me,<br>
I would have put my wealth into donation,<br>
And the best half should have return&#8217;d to him,<br>
So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,<br>
Men must learn now with pity to dispense;<br>
For policy sits above conscience.</p>

<p class="speech">Must he needs trouble me in

<p class="speech">How! have they denied him?<br>
Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?<br>
And does he send to me? Three? hum!<br>
It shows but little love or judgment in him:<br>
Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
physicians,<br>
Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?<br>
Has much disgraced me in&#8217;t; I&#8217;m angry at him,<br>
That might have known my place: I see no sense for&#8217;t,<br>
But his occasion might have woo&#8217;d me first;<br>
For, in my conscience, I was the first man<br>
That e&#8217;er received gift from him:<br>
And does he think so backwardly of me now,<br>
That I&#8217;ll requite its last? No:<br>
So it may prove an argument of laughter<br>
To the rest, and &#8217;mongst lords I be thought a fool.<br>
I&#8217;ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,<br>
Had sent to me first, but for my mind&#8217;s sake;<br>
I&#8217;d such a courage to do him good. But now return,<br>
And with their faint reply this answer join;<br>
Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speech">Excellent! Your lordship&#8217;s a goodly
villain. The
devil knew not what he did when he made man
politic; he crossed himself by &#8217;t: and I cannot
think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
politic love.<br>
This was my lord&#8217;s best hope; now all are fled,<br>
Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,<br>
Doors, that were ne&#8217;er acquainted with their wards<br>
Many a bounteous year must be employ&#8217;d<br>

clear:<br>
To revenge is no valour, but to bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,<br>
If I speak like a captain.<br>
Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,<br>
And not endure all threats? sleep upon&#8217;t,<br>
And let the foes quietly cut their throats,<br>
Without repugnancy? If there be<br>
Such valour in the bearing, what make we<br>
Abroad? why then, women are more valiant<br>
That stay at home, if bearing carry it,<br>
And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon<br>
Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,<br>
If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,<br>
As you are great, be pitifully good:<br>
Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?<br>
To kill, I grant, is sin&#8217;s extremest gust;<br>
But, in defence, by mercy, &#8217;tis most just.<br>
To be in anger is impiety;<br>
But who is man that is not angry?<br>
Weigh but the crime with this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">You breathe in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">In vain! his service done<br>
At Lacedaemon and Byzantium<br>
Were a sufficient briber for his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I say, my lords, he has done fair service,<br>
And slain in fight many of your enemies:<br>
How full of valour did he bear himself<br>
In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">He has made too much plenty with &#8217;em;<br>
He&#8217;s a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often<br>
Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:<br>
If there were no foes, that were enough<br>
To overcome him: in that beastly fury<br>
He has been known to commit outrages,<br>
And cherish factions: &#8217;tis inferr&#8217;d to us,<br>
His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">He dies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Hard fate! he might have died in war.<br>
My lords, if not for any parts in him&#8212;<br>
Though his right arm might purchase his own time<br>
And be in debt to none&#8212;yet, more to move you,<br>
Take my deserts to his, and join &#8217;em both:<br>
And, for I know your reverend ages love<br>
Security, I&#8217;ll pawn my victories, all<br>
My honours to you, upon his good returns.<br>
If by this crime he owes the law his life,<br>
Why, let the war receive &#8217;t in valiant gore<br>
For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,<br>
On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,<br>
He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,<br>
I do beseech you, know me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>

<p class="speech">What!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot think but your age has forgot me;<br>
It could not else be, I should prove so base,<br>
To sue, and be denied such common grace:<br>
My wounds ache at you.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Do you dare our anger?<br>
&#8217;Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;<br>
We banish thee for ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>

Banish your dotage; banish usury,<br>
That makes the senate ugly.</p>

thee,<br>
Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
our spirit,<br>
He shall be executed presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Senators</span></p>

<p class="speech">Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may
live<br>
Only in bone, that none may look on you!<br>
I&#8217;m worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,<br>
While they have told their money and let out<br>
Their coin upon large interest, I myself<br>
Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?<br>
Is this the balsam that the usuring senate<br>
Pours into captains&#8217; wounds? Banishment!<br>
It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish&#8217;d;<br>
It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,<br>
That I may strike at Athens. I&#8217;ll cheer up<br>
My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.<br>
&#8217;Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;<br>
Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.</p>

<p class="speech">Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would
to
the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
one need not lend to another; for, were your
godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
the table, let a dozen of them be&#8212;as they are. The
rest of your fees, O gods&#8212;the senators of Athens,
together with the common lag of people&#8212;what is
amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
destruction. For these my present friends, as they
are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
nothing are they welcome.
Uncover, dogs, and lap.</p>

You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water<br>

<p class="speech">Thy lips rot off!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns<br>
To thine own lips again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">How came the noble Timon to this change?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">As the moon does, by wanting light to give:<br>
But then renew I could not, like the moon;<br>
There were no suns to borrow of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Timon,<br>
What friendship may I do thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">None, but to<br>
Maintain my opinion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">What is it, Timon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Promise me friendship, but perform none: if
thou
wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
thou art a man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou saw&#8217;st them, when I had
prosperity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I see them now; then was a blessed time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">As thine is now, held with a brace of
harlots.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world<br>
Voiced so regardfully?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou Timandra?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">Yes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Be a whore still: they love thee not that use
thee;<br>
Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.<br>
Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves<br>
For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth<br>
To the tub-fast and the diet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">Hang thee, monster!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits<br>
Are drown&#8217;d and lost in his calamities.<br>
I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,<br>
The want whereof doth daily make revolt<br>
In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,<br>
How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,<br>
Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,<br>
But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How dost thou pity him whom thou dost
trouble?<br>
I had rather be alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Why, fare thee well:<br>
Here is some gold for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Keep it, I cannot eat it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">When I have laid proud Athens on a
heap,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Warr&#8217;st thou &#8217;gainst Athens?</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Timon, and have cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">The gods confound them all in thy conquest;<br>
And thee after, when thou hast conquer&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Why me, Timon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That, by killing of villains,<br>
Thou wast born to conquer my country.<br>
Put up thy gold: go on,&#8212;here&#8217;s gold,&#8212;go on;<br>
Be as a planetary plague, when Jove<br>
Will o&#8217;er some high-viced city hang his poison<br>
In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:<br>
Pity not honour&#8217;d age for his white beard;<br>
He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;<br>
It is her habit only that is honest,<br>
Herself&#8217;s a bawd: let not the virgin&#8217;s cheek<br>
Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,<br>
That through the window-bars bore at men&#8217;s eyes,<br>
Are not within the leaf of pity writ,<br>
But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,<br>
Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;<br>
Think it a bastard, whom the oracle<br>
Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,<br>
And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;<br>
Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;<br>
Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,<br>
Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,<br>
Shall pierce a jot. There&#8217;s gold to pay soldiers:<br>
Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,<br>
Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou gold yet? I&#8217;ll take the gold
thou
givest me,
Not all thy counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven&#8217;s
curse
upon thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Phrynia</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou
more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,<br>
And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,<br>
Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,<br>
Although, I know, you &#8217;ll swear, terribly swear<br>
Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues<br>
The immortal gods that hear you,&#8212;spare your oaths,<br>
I&#8217;ll trust to your conditions: be whores still;<br>
And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,<br>
Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;<br>
Let your close fire predominate his smoke,<br>
And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,<br>
Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs<br>
With burthens of the dead;&#8212;some that were hang&#8217;d,<br>
No matter:&#8212;wear them, betray with them: whore still;<br>
Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,<br>
A pox of wrinkles!</p>
<p class="speaker">Phrynia</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">Well, more gold: what then?<br>
Believe&#8217;t, that we&#8217;ll do any thing for gold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Consumptions sow<br>
In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,<br>
And mar men&#8217;s spurring. Crack the lawyer&#8217;s voice,<br>
That he may never more false title plead,<br>
Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,<br>
That scolds against the quality of flesh,<br>
And not believes himself: down with the nose,<br>
Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away<br>
Of him that, his particular to foresee,<br>
Smells from the general weal: make curl&#8217;d-pate
ruffians bald;<br>
And let the unscarr&#8217;d braggarts of the war<br>
Derive some pain from you: plague all;<br>
That your activity may defeat and quell<br>
The source of all erection. There&#8217;s more gold:<br>
Do you damn others, and let this damn you,<br>
And ditches grave you all!</p>
<p class="speaker">Phrynia</p>
<p class="speaker">Timandra</p>
<p class="speech">More counsel with more money, bounteous
Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">More whore, more mischief first; I have given you
earnest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell,
Timon:<br>
If I thrive well, I&#8217;ll visit thee again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">If I hope well, I&#8217;ll never see thee
more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">I never did thee harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, thou spokest well of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Call&#8217;st thou that harm?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take<br>
Thy beagles with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">We but offend him. Strike!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drum beats. Exeunt
Alcibiades, Phrynia, and Timandra</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">That nature, being sick of man&#8217;s
unkindness,<br>
Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Digging</span></p>
<p class="speech">Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,<br>
Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,<br>
Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff&#8217;d,<br>
Engenders the black toad and adder blue,<br>
The gilded newt and eyeless venom&#8217;d worm,<br>
With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven<br>
Whereon Hyperion&#8217;s quickening fire doth shine;<br>
Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,<br>
From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!<br>
Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,<br>
Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!<br>
Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;<br>
Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face<br>
Hath to the marbled mansion all above<br>
Never presented!&#8212;O, a root,&#8212;dear thanks!&#8212;<br>
Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;<br>
Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts<br>
And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,<br>
That from it all consideration slips!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Apemantus</span></p>
<p class="speech">More man? plague, plague!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I was directed hither: men report<br>
Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a
dog,<br>
Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">This is in thee a nature but infected;<br>
A poor unmanly melancholy sprung<br>
From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?<br>
This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?<br>
Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;<br>
Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot<br>
That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,<br>
By putting on the cunning of a carper.<br>
Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive<br>
By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,<br>
And let his very breath, whom thou&#8217;lt observe,<br>
Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,<br>
And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;<br>
Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome<br>
To knaves and all approachers: &#8217;tis most just<br>
That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,<br>
Rascals should have &#8217;t. Do not assume my likeness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Were I like thee, I&#8217;ld throw away
myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast cast away thyself, being like
thyself;<br>
A madman so long, now a fool. What, think&#8217;st<br>
That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,<br>
Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss&#8217;d trees,<br>
That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,<br>
And skip where thou point&#8217;st out? will the
cold brook,<br>
Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,<br>
To cure thy o&#8217;er-night&#8217;s surfeit? Call the
creatures<br>
Whose naked natures live in an the spite<br>
Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,<br>
To the conflicting elements exposed,<br>
Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;<br>
O, thou shalt find&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">A fool of thee: depart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I love thee better now than e&#8217;er I did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I hate thee worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou flatter&#8217;st misery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou seek me out?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">To vex thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Always a villain&#8217;s office or a
fool&#8217;s.<br>
Dost please thyself in&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What! a knave too?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on<br>
To castigate thy pride, &#8217;twere well: but thou<br>
Dost it enforcedly; thou&#8217;ldst courtier be again,<br>
Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery<br>
Outlives encertain pomp, is crown&#8217;d before:<br>
The one is filling still, never complete;<br>
The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,<br>
Hath a distracted and most wretched being,<br>
Worse than the worst, content.<br>
Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Not by his breath that is more miserable.<br>
Thou art a slave, whom Fortune&#8217;s tender arm<br>
With favour never clasp&#8217;d; but bred a dog.<br>
Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded<br>
The sweet degrees that this brief world affords<br>
To such as may the passive drugs of it<br>
Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself<br>
In general riot; melted down thy youth<br>
In different beds of lust; and never learn&#8217;d<br>
The icy precepts of respect, but follow&#8217;d<br>
The sugar&#8217;d game before thee. But myself,<br>
Who had the world as my confectionary,<br>
The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men<br>
At duty, more than I could frame employment,<br>
That numberless upon me stuck as leaves<br>
Do on the oak, hive with one winter&#8217;s brush<br>
Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare<br>
For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,<br>
That never knew but better, is some burden:<br>
Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time<br>
Hath made thee hard in&#8217;t. Why shouldst thou hate men?<br>
They never flatter&#8217;d thee: what hast thou given?<br>
If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,<br>
Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff<br>
To some she beggar and compounded thee<br>
Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!<br>
If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,<br>
Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Art thou proud yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that I am not thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">I, that I was<br>
No prodigal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I, that I am one now:<br>
Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,<br>
I&#8217;ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.<br>
That the whole life of Athens were in this!<br>
Thus would I eat it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Eating a root</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Here; I will mend thy feast.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Offering him a
root</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">First mend my company, take away thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of
thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not well mended so, it is but
botch&#8217;d;
if not, I would it were.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou have to Athens?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,<br>
Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Here is no use for gold.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">The best and truest;<br>
For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Where liest o&#8217; nights, Timon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Under that&#8217;s above me.<br>
Where feed&#8217;st thou o&#8217; days, Apemantus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I
eat
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Where wouldst thou send it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">To sauce thy dishes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but
the
extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
despised for the contrary. There&#8217;s a medlar for
thee, eat it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">On what I hate I feed not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Dost hate a medlar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, though it look like thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou
shouldst
have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst
thou
ever know beloved?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep
a
dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">What things in the world canst thou nearest
compare
to thy flatterers?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Women nearest; but men, men are the things
themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion
of
men, and remain a beast with the beasts?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee
t&#8217;
attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
thou already, that seest not thy loss in
transformation!</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">If thou couldst please me with speaking to me,
thou
mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
Athens is become a forest of beasts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out
of the city?</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague
of
company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
and give way: when I know not what else to do, I&#8217;ll
see thee again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt
be
welcome. I had rather be a beggar&#8217;s dog than Apemantus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>

<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">All villains that do stand by thee are pure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">There is no leprosy but what thou

<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!<br>
Choler does kill me that thou art alive;<br>
I swound to see thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Apemantus</p>
<p class="speech">Would thou wouldst burst!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>

But even the mere necessities upon &#8217;t.<br>
Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;<br>
Lie where the light foam the sea may beat<br>
Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,<br>
That death in me at others&#8217; lives may laugh.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Banditti</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">Where should he have this gold? It is some
poor
fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
friends, drove him into this melancholy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">Let us make the assay upon him: if he care
not
for&#8217;t, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
reserve it, how shall&#8217;s get it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">True; for he bears it not about him, &#8217;tis
hid.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">Is not this he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Banditti</p>
<p class="speech">Where?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis his description.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">He; I know him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banditti</p>
<p class="speech">Save thee, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Now, thieves?</p>
<p class="speaker">Banditti</p>
<p class="speech">Soldiers, not thieves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Both too; and women&#8217;s sons.</p>
<p class="speaker">Banditti</p>
<p class="speech">We are not thieves, but men that much do
want.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.<br>
Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;<br>
Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;<br>
The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;<br>
The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush<br>
Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,<br>
As beasts and birds and fishes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and
fishes;<br>
You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con<br>
That you are thieves profess&#8217;d, that you work not<br>
In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft<br>
In limited professions. Rascal thieves,<br>
Here&#8217;s gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o&#8217; the
grape,<br>
Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,<br>
And so &#8217;scape hanging: trust not the physician;<br>
His antidotes are poison, and he slays<br>
Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;<br>
Do villany, do, since you protest to do&#8217;t,<br>
Like workmen. I&#8217;ll example you with thievery.<br>
The sun&#8217;s a thief, and with his great attraction<br>
Robs the vast sea: the moon&#8217;s an arrant thief,<br>
And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:<br>
The sea&#8217;s a thief, whose liquid surge resolves<br>
The moon into salt tears: the earth&#8217;s a thief,<br>
That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen<br>
From general excrement: each thing&#8217;s a thief:<br>
The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power<br>
Have uncheque&#8217;d theft. Love not yourselves: away,<br>
Rob one another. There&#8217;s more gold. Cut throats:<br>
All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,<br>
Break open shops; nothing can you steal,<br>
But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this<br>
I give you; and gold confound you howsoe&#8217;er! Amen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
persuading me to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus
advises
us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll believe him as an enemy, and give over
my trade.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Bandit</p>
<p class="speech">Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no
time
so miserable but a man may be true.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Banditti</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Flavius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">O you gods!<br>
Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?<br>
Full of decay and failing? O monument<br>
And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow&#8217;d!<br>
What an alteration of honour<br>
Has desperate want made!<br>
What viler thing upon the earth than friends<br>
Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!<br>
How rarely does it meet with this time&#8217;s guise,<br>
When man was wish&#8217;d to love his enemies!<br>
Grant I may ever love, and rather woo<br>
Those that would mischief me than those that do!<br>
Has caught me in his eye: I will present<br>
My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,<br>
Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Away! what art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Have you forgot me, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;<br>
Then, if thou grant&#8217;st thou&#8217;rt a man, I have forgot
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">An honest poor servant of yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Then I know thee not:<br>
I never had honest man about me, I; all<br>
I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">The gods are witness,<br>
Ne&#8217;er did poor steward wear a truer grief<br>
For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
love thee,<br>
Because thou art a woman, and disclaim&#8217;st<br>
Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give<br>
But thorough lust and laughter. Pity&#8217;s sleeping:<br>
Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">I beg of you to know me, good my lord,<br>
To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts<br>
To entertain me as your steward still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Had I a steward<br>
So true, so just, and now so comfortable?<br>
It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.<br>
Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man<br>
Was born of woman.<br>
Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,<br>
You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim<br>
One honest man&#8212;mistake me not&#8212;but one;<br>
No more, I pray,&#8212;and he&#8217;s a steward.<br>
How fain would I have hated all mankind!<br>
And thou redeem&#8217;st thyself: but all, save thee,<br>
I fell with curses.<br>
Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;<br>
For, by oppressing and betraying me,<br>
Thou mightst have sooner got another service:<br>
For many so arrive at second masters,<br>
Upon their first lord&#8217;s neck. But tell me true&#8212;<br>
For I must ever doubt, though ne&#8217;er so sure&#8212;<br>
Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,<br>
If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,<br>
Expecting in return twenty for one?</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">No, my most worthy master; in whose breast<br>
Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:<br>
You should have fear&#8217;d false times when you did feast:<br>
Suspect still comes where an estate is least.<br>
That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,<br>
Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,<br>
Care of your food and living; and, believe it,<br>
My most honour&#8217;d lord,<br>
For any benefit that points to me,<br>
Either in hope or present, I&#8217;ld exchange<br>
For this one wish, that you had power and wealth<br>
To requite me, by making rich yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Look thee, &#8217;tis so! Thou singly honest
man,<br>
Here, take: the gods out of my misery<br>
Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;<br>
But thus condition&#8217;d: thou shalt build from men;<br>
Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,<br>
But let the famish&#8217;d flesh slide from the bone,<br>
Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs<br>
What thou deny&#8217;st to men; let prisons swallow &#8217;em,<br>
Debts wither &#8217;em to nothing; be men like
blasted woods,<br>
And may diseases lick up their false bloods!<br>
And so farewell and thrive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me stay,<br>
And comfort you, my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">If thou hatest curses,<br>
Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:<br>
Ne&#8217;er see thou man, and let me ne&#8217;er see thee.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Poet and Painter; Timon
watching them from his cave</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">As I took note of the place, it cannot be far
where
he abides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s to be thought of him? does the
rumour hold
for true, that he&#8217;s so full of gold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
straggling soldiers with great quantity: &#8217;tis said
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Then this breaking of his has been but a try for
his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in
Athens
again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
&#8217;tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
what they travail for, if it be a just true report
that goes of his having.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">What have you now to present unto him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I
will
promise him an excellent piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I must serve him so too, tell him of an
intent
that&#8217;s coming toward him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Good as the best. Promising is the very air
o&#8217; the
time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
in his judgment that makes it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Timon comes from his cave,
behind</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Excellent
workman! thou canst not paint a
man so bad as is thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I am thinking what I shall say I have provided
for
him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Must thou
needs stand for a villain in
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let&#8217;s seek him:<br>
Then do we sin against our own estate,<br>
When we may profit meet, and come too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">True;<br>
When the day serves, before black-corner&#8217;d night,<br>
Find what thou want&#8217;st by free and offer&#8217;d light.
Come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I&#8217;ll
meet you at the turn. What a
god&#8217;s gold,<br>
That he is worshipp&#8217;d in a baser temple<br>
Than where swine feed!<br>
&#8217;Tis thou that rigg&#8217;st the bark and plough&#8217;st the
foam,<br>
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:<br>
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye<br>
Be crown&#8217;d with plagues that thee alone obey!<br>
Fit I meet them.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Coming forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, worthy Timon!</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Our late noble master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Have I once lived to see two honest men?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
Having often of your open bounty tasted,<br>
Hearing you were retired, your friends fall&#8217;n off,<br>
Whose thankless natures&#8212;O abhorred spirits!&#8212;<br>
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:<br>
What! to you,<br>
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence<br>
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover<br>
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude<br>
With any size of words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Let it go naked, men may see&#8217;t the
better:<br>
You that are honest, by being what you are,<br>
Make them best seen and known.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">He and myself<br>
Have travail&#8217;d in the great shower of your gifts,<br>
And sweetly felt it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, you are honest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">We are hither come to offer you our service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite
you?<br>
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">What we can do, we&#8217;ll do, to do you
service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ye&#8217;re honest men: ye&#8217;ve heard that I
have gold;<br>
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye&#8217;re honest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore<br>
Came not my friend nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Good honest men! Thou draw&#8217;st a
counterfeit<br>
Best in all Athens: thou&#8217;rt, indeed, the best;<br>
Thou counterfeit&#8217;st most lively.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">So, so, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy
fiction,<br>
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth<br>
That thou art even natural in thine art.<br>
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,<br>
I must needs say you have a little fault:<br>
Marry, &#8217;tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I<br>
You take much pains to mend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Beseech your honour<br>
To make it known to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll take it ill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Most thankfully, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Will you, indeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Doubt it not, worthy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s never a one of you but trusts a
knave,<br>
That mightily deceives you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Do we, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,<br>
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,<br>
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured<br>
That he&#8217;s a made-up villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I know none such, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Look you, I love you well; I&#8217;ll give you
gold,<br>
Rid me these villains from your companies:<br>
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,<br>
Confound them by some course, and come to me,<br>
I&#8217;ll give you gold enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Name them, my lord, let&#8217;s know them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You that way and you this, but two in
company;<br>
Each man apart, all single and alone,<br>
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.<br>
If where thou art two villains shall not be,<br>
Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside<br>
But where one villain is, then him abandon.<br>
Hence, pack! there&#8217;s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Painter</span></p>
<p class="speech">You have work&#8217;d for me; there&#8217;s
payment for you: hence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Poet</span></p>
<p class="speech">You are an alchemist; make gold of that.<br>
Out, rascal dogs!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats them out, and then
retires to his cave</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Flavius and two
Senators</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">It is in vain that you would speak with
Timon;<br>
For he is set so only to himself<br>
That nothing but himself which looks like man<br>
Is friendly with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Bring us to his cave:<br>
It is our part and promise to the Athenians<br>
To speak with Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">At all times alike<br>
Men are not still the same: &#8217;twas time and griefs<br>
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,<br>
Offering the fortunes of his former days,<br>
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,<br>
And chance it as it may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Here is his cave.<br>
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!<br>
Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,<br>
By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:<br>
Speak to them, noble Timon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Timon comes from his
cave</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou sun, that comfort&#8217;st, burn! Speak,
and
be hang&#8217;d:<br>
For each true word, a blister! and each false<br>
Be as cauterizing to the root o&#8217; the tongue,<br>
Consuming it with speaking!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Timon,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I thank them; and would send them back the
plague,<br>
Could I but catch it for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">O, forget<br>
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.<br>
The senators with one consent of love<br>
Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought<br>
On special dignities, which vacant lie<br>
For thy best use and wearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">They confess<br>
Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:<br>
Which now the public body, which doth seldom<br>
Play the recanter, feeling in itself<br>
A lack of Timon&#8217;s aid, hath sense withal<br>
Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;<br>
And send forth us, to make their sorrow&#8217;d render,<br>
Together with a recompense more fruitful<br>
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;<br>
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth<br>
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs<br>
And write in thee the figures of their love,<br>
Ever to read them thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You witch me in it;<br>
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:<br>
Lend me a fool&#8217;s heart and a woman&#8217;s eyes,<br>
And I&#8217;ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, so please thee to return with us<br>
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take<br>
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,<br>
Allow&#8217;d with absolute power and thy good name<br>
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back<br>
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,<br>
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up<br>
His country&#8217;s peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">And shakes his threatening sword<br>
Against the walls of Athens.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, Timon,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir;
thus:<br>
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,<br>
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,<br>
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,<br>
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,<br>
Giving our holy virgins to the stain<br>
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain&#8217;d war,<br>
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,<br>
In pity of our aged and our youth,<br>
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,<br>
And let him take&#8217;t at worst; for their knives care not,<br>
While you have throats to answer: for myself,<br>
There&#8217;s not a whittle in the unruly camp<br>
But I do prize it at my love before<br>
The reverend&#8217;st throat in Athens. So I leave you<br>
To the protection of the prosperous gods,<br>
As thieves to keepers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay not, all&#8217;s in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I was writing of my epitaph;<br>
It will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness<br>
Of health and living now begins to mend,<br>
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;<br>
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,<br>
And last so long enough!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">We speak in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">But yet I love my country, and am not<br>
One that rejoices in the common wreck,<br>
As common bruit doth put it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s well spoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to my loving countrymen,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">These words become your lips as they pass
thorough them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">And enter in our ears like great triumphers<br>
In their applauding gates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to them,<br>
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,<br>
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,<br>
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes<br>
That nature&#8217;s fragile vessel doth sustain<br>
In life&#8217;s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:<br>
I&#8217;ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades&#8217; wrath.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">I like this well; he will return again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I have a tree, which grows here in my close,<br>
That mine own use invites me to cut down,<br>
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,<br>
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree<br>
From high to low throughout, that whoso please<br>
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,<br>
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,<br>
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Come not to me again: but say to Athens,<br>
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion<br>
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;<br>
Who once a day with his embossed froth<br>
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,<br>
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.<br>
Lips, let sour words go by and language end:<br>
What is amiss plague and infection mend!<br>
Graves only be men&#8217;s works and death their gain!<br>
Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.</p>

Coupled to nature.</p>

In our dear peril.</p>

<p class="speech">Thou hast painfully discover&#8217;d: are his

As full as thy report?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>

Besides, his expedition promises<br>
Present approach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>

Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;<br>
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,<br>
Yet our old love made a particular force,<br>
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding<br>
From Alcibiades to Timon&#8217;s cave,<br>
With letters of entreaty, which imported<br>
His fellowship i&#8217; the cause against your city,<br>
In part for his sake moved.</p>

Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.</p>

Who&#8217;s here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?<br>
Timon is dead, who hath outstretch&#8217;d his span:<br>
Some beast rear&#8217;d this; there does not live a man.<br>
Dead, sure; and this his grave. What&#8217;s on this tomb<br>
I cannot read; the character I&#8217;ll take with wax:<br>
Our captain hath in every figure skill,<br>
An aged interpreter, though young in days:<br>

<p class="speech">Till now you have gone on and fill&#8217;d the
time<br>
With all licentious measure, making your wills<br>
The scope of justice; till now myself and such<br>
As slept within the shadow of your power<br>
Hav e wander&#8217;d with our traversed arms and breathed<br>
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,<br>
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong<br>
Cries of itself &#8216;No more:&#8217; now breathless wrong<br>
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,<br>
And pursy insolence shall break his wind<br>
With fear and horrid flight.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Noble and young,<br>
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,<br>
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,<br>
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,<br>
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves<br>
Above their quantity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">So did we woo<br>
Transformed Timon to our city&#8217;s love<br>
By humble message and by promised means:<br>
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve<br>
The common stroke of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">These walls of ours<br>
Were not erected by their hands from whom<br>
You have received your griefs; nor are they such<br>
That these great towers, trophies and schools
should fall<br>
For private faults in them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Nor are they living<br>
Who were the motives that you first went out;<br>
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess<br>
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,<br>
Into our city with thy banners spread:<br>
By decimation, and a tithed death&#8212;<br>
If thy revenges hunger for that food<br>
Which nature loathes&#8212;take thou the destined tenth,<br>
And by the hazard of the spotted die<br>
Let die the spotted.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">All have not offended;<br>
For those that were, it is not square to take<br>
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,<br>
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,<br>
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:<br>
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin<br>
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall<br>
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,<br>
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,<br>
But kill not all together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What thou wilt,<br>
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile<br>
Than hew to&#8217;t with thy sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Set but thy foot<br>
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;<br>
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,<br>
To say thou&#8217;lt enter friendly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Throw thy glove,<br>
Or any token of thine honour else,<br>
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress<br>
And not as our confusion, all thy powers<br>
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we<br>
Have seal&#8217;d thy full desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>

Descend, and open your uncharged ports:<br>
Those enemies of Timon&#8217;s and mine own<br>
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof<br>
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears<br>
With my more noble meaning, not a man<br>
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream<br>
Of regular justice in your city&#8217;s bounds,<br>
But shall be render&#8217;d to your public laws<br>
At heaviest answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>

Entomb&#8217;d upon the very hem o&#8217; the sea;<br>
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which<br>
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression<br>
Interprets for my poor ignorance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads the epitaph]</span>
&#8216;Here lies a
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:<br>
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left!<br>
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:<br>
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
not here thy gait.&#8217;<br>
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:<br>
Though thou abhorr&#8217;dst in us our human griefs,<br>
Scorn&#8217;dst our brain&#8217;s flow and those our
droplets which<br>
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit<br>
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye<br>
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead<br>
Is noble Timon: of whose memory<br>
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,<br>
And I will use the olive with my sword,<br>
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each<br>
Prescribe to other as each other&#8217;s leech.<br>
Let our drums strike.</p>
