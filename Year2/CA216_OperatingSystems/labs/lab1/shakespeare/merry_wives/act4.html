<h4>Scene I. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mistress Page, Mistress
Quickly, and William Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Is he at Master Ford&#8217;s already,
think&#8217;st thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Sure he is by this, or will be presently:
but,
truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be with her by and by; I&#8217;ll but
bring my young
man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
&#8217;tis a playing-day, I see.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Sir Hugh
Evans</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to
play.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Blessing of his heart!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing
in
the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
questions in his accidence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, William; hold up your head;
come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer
your
master, be not afraid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">William, how many numbers is in nouns?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I thought there had been one number
more,
because they say, &#8216;&#8217;Od&#8217;s nouns.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Peace your tattlings! What is &#8216;fair,&#8217;
William?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Pulcher.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats,
sure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">You are a very simplicity &#8217;oman: I pray you
peace.<br>
What is &#8216;lapis,&#8217; William?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">A stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">And what is &#8216;a stone,&#8217; William?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">A pebble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">No, it is &#8216;lapis:&#8217; I pray you,
remember in your prain.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Lapis.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">That is a good William. What is he, William,
that
does lend articles?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be
thus
declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Accusativo, hinc.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
accusative, hung, hang, hog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Hang-hog&#8217; is Latin for bacon, I
warrant you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Leave your prabbles, &#8217;oman. What is the
focative
case, William?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">O,&#8212;vocativo, O.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Remember, William; focative is caret.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">And that&#8217;s a good root.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Oman, forbear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Peace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">What is your genitive case plural, William?</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Genitive case!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Genitive,&#8212;horum, harum, horum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Vengeance of Jenny&#8217;s case! fie on her!
never name
her, child, if she be a whore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">For shame, &#8217;oman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">You do ill to teach the child such words: he
teaches him to hick and to hack, which they&#8217;ll do
fast enough of themselves, and to call &#8216;horum:&#8217; fie
upon you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
I would desires.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, hold thy peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Show me now, William, some declensions of your
pronouns.</p>
<p class="speaker">William Page</p>
<p class="speech">Forsooth, I have forgot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your
&#8217;quies,&#8217;
your &#8216;quaes,&#8217; and your &#8216;quods,&#8217; you must
be
preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">He is a better scholar than I thought he was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress
Page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, good Sir Hugh.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Sir Hugh
Evans</span></p>
<p class="speech">Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.</p>

<h4>Scene II. A room in Ford&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Falstaff and Mistress
Ford</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
and I profess requital to a hair&#8217;s breadth; not
only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
complement and ceremony of it. But are you
sure of your husband now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s a-birding, sweet Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> What, ho,
gossip Ford! what, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Step into the chamber, Sir John.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mistress
Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">How now, sweetheart! who&#8217;s at home besides
yourself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, none but mine own people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">No, certainly.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside to her</span></p>
<p class="speech">Speak louder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes
again:
he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
against all married mankind; so curses all Eve&#8217;s
daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
himself on the forehead, crying, &#8216;Peer out, peer
out!&#8217; that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
tameness, civility and patience, to this his
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, does he talk of him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Of none but him; and swears he was carried out,
the
last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
the rest of their company from their sport, to make
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">How near is he, Mistress Page?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I am undone! The knight is here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why then you are utterly shamed, and he&#8217;s
but a dead
man. What a woman are you!&#8212;Away with him, away
with him! better shame than murder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Which way should be go? how should I bestow
him?<br>
Shall I put him into the basket again?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">No, I&#8217;ll come no more i&#8217; the basket.
May I not go
out ere he come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, three of Master Ford&#8217;s brothers watch
the door
with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What shall I do? I&#8217;ll creep up into the
chimney.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">There they always use to discharge their
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Where is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">He will seek there, on my word. Neither
press,
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll go out then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">If you go out in your own semblance, you die,
Sir<br>
John. Unless you go out disguised&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">How might we disguise him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Alas the day, I know not! There is no
woman&#8217;s gown
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Good hearts, devise something: any extremity
rather
than a mischief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">My maid&#8217;s aunt, the fat woman of Brentford,
has a
gown above.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">On my word, it will serve him; she&#8217;s as big
as he
is: and there&#8217;s her thrummed hat and her muffler
too. Run up, Sir John.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I
will
look some linen for your head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Quick, quick! we&#8217;ll come dress you
straight: put
on the gown the while.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I would my husband would meet him in this shape:
he
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
she&#8217;s a witch; forbade her my house and hath
threatened to beat her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven guide him to thy husband&#8217;s cudgel,
and the
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">But is my husband coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the
basket
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll try that; for I&#8217;ll appoint my
men to carry the
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
they did last time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but he&#8217;ll be here presently:
let&#8217;s go dress him
like the witch of Brentford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll first direct my men what they shall do
with the
basket. Go up; I&#8217;ll bring linen for him straight.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him
enough.<br>
We&#8217;ll leave a proof, by that which we will do,<br>
Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:<br>
We do not act that often jest and laugh;<br>
&#8217;Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Mistress Ford with
two Servants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Go, sirs, take the basket again on your
shoulders:
your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, take it up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Servant</p>
<p class="speech">I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ford, Page, Shallow,
Doctor Caius, and Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you
any
way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
O you panderly rascals! there&#8217;s a knot, a ging, a
pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to
go
loose any longer; you must be pinioned.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad
dog!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well,
indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">So say I too, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Mistress
Ford</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the
honest
woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
without cause, mistress, do I?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me
in
any dishonesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth,
sirrah!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pulling clothes out of the
basket</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">This passes!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I shall find you anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your
wife&#8217;s
clothes? Come away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Empty the basket, I say!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Master Page, as I am a man, there was one
conveyed
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
Pluck me out all the linen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">If you find a man there, he shall die a
flea&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s no man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shallow</p>
<p class="speech">By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford;
this
wrongs you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow
the
imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Well, he&#8217;s not here I seek for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Help to search my house this one time. If I
find
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
me, &#8216;As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
walnut for his wife&#8217;s leman.&#8217; Satisfy me once more;
once more search with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old
woman
down; my husband will come into the chamber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Old woman! what old woman&#8217;s that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, it is my maid&#8217;s aunt of Brentford.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I
not
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
she? We are simple men; we do not know what&#8217;s
brought to pass under the profession of
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
you hag, you; come down, I say!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let
him
not strike the old woman.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Falstaff in
woman&#8217;s clothes, and Mistress Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll prat her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beating him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage,
you
polecat, you runyon! out, out! I&#8217;ll conjure you,
I&#8217;ll fortune-tell you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Falstaff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed
the
poor woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, he will do it. &#8217;Tis a goodly credit
for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Hang her, witch!</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">By the yea and no, I think the &#8217;oman is a
witch
indeed: I like not when a &#8217;oman has a great peard;
I spy a great peard under his muffler.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you,
follow;
see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Let&#8217;s obey his humour a little further:
come,
gentlemen.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Ford, Page, Shallow,
Doctor Caius, and Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him
most
unpitifully, methought.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll have the cudgel hallowed and hung
o&#8217;er the
altar; it hath done meritorious service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">What think you? may we, with the warrant of
womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
pursue him with any further revenge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out
of
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
way of waste, attempt us again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Shall we tell our husbands how we have served
him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
figures out of your husband&#8217;s brains. If they can
find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
the ministers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll warrant they&#8217;ll have him
publicly shamed: and
methinks there would be no period to the jest,
should he not be publicly shamed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I
would
not have things cool.</p>

<p class="speech">Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
court, and they are going to meet him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">What duke should that be comes so secretly? I
hear
not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
gentlemen: they speak English?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; I&#8217;ll call them to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">They shall have my horses; but I&#8217;ll make
them pay;
I&#8217;ll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
command; I have turned away my other guests: they
must come off; I&#8217;ll sauce them. Come.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Page, Ford, Mistress
Page, Mistress Ford, and Sir Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis one of the best discretions of a
&#8217;oman as ever<br>
I did look upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">And did he send you both these letters at an
instant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Within a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou
wilt;<br>
I rather will suspect the sun with cold<br>
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand<br>
In him that was of late an heretic,<br>
As firm as faith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well, &#8217;tis well; no more:<br>
Be not as extreme in submission<br>
As in offence.<br>
But let our plot go forward: let our wives<br>
Yet once again, to make us public sport,<br>
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,<br>
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">There is no better way than that they spoke
of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">How? to send him word they&#8217;ll meet him in
the park
at midnight? Fie, fie! he&#8217;ll never come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">You say he has been thrown in the rivers and
has
been grievously peaten as an old &#8217;oman: methinks
there should be terrors in him that he should not
come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
no desires.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">So think I too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Devise but how you&#8217;ll use him when he
comes,<br>
And let us two devise to bring him thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">There is an old tale goes that Herne the
hunter,<br>
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<br>
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,<br>
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg&#8217;d horns;<br>
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle<br>
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain<br>
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:<br>
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<br>
The superstitious idle-headed eld<br>
Received and did deliver to our age<br>
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Why, yet there want not many that do fear<br>
In deep of night to walk by this Herne&#8217;s oak:<br>
But what of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Marry, this is our device;<br>
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">Well, let it not be doubted but he&#8217;ll
come:<br>
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,<br>
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:<br>
Nan Page my daughter and my little son<br>
And three or four more of their growth we&#8217;ll dress<br>
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,<br>
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,<br>
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,<br>
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,<br>
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once<br>
With some diffused song: upon their sight,<br>
We two in great amazedness will fly:<br>
Then let them all encircle him about<br>
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,<br>
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,<br>
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread<br>
In shape profane.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Ford</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And till he tell the truth,<br>
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound<br>
And burn him with their tapers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">The truth being known,<br>
We&#8217;ll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,<br>
And mock him home to Windsor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">The children must<br>
Be practised well to this, or they&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er
do&#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">I will teach the children their behaviors; and
I
will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
knight with my taber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">That will be excellent. I&#8217;ll go and buy
them vizards.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,<br>
Finely attired in a robe of white.</p>
<p class="speaker">Page</p>
<p class="speech">That silk will I go buy.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">And in that time<br>
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away<br>
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ford</p>
<p class="speech">Nay I&#8217;ll to him again in name of Brook<br>
He&#8217;ll tell me all his purpose: sure, he&#8217;ll come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Fear not you that. Go get us properties<br>
And tricking for our fairies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and
fery
honest knaveries.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Page, Ford, and Sir
Hugh Evans</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Page</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Mistress Ford,<br>
Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Mistress Ford</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll to the doctor: he hath my good
will,<br>
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.<br>
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;<br>
And he my husband best of all affects.<br>
The doctor is well money&#8217;d, and his friends<br>
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,<br>
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.</p>

<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John
Falstaff
from Master Slender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s his chamber, his house, his castle,
his
standing-bed and truckle-bed; &#8217;tis painted about
with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
unto thee: knock, I say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s an old woman, a fat woman, gone up
into his
chamber: I&#8217;ll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
down; I come to speak with her, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed:
I&#8217;ll
call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
host, thine Ephesian, calls.</p>

<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Here&#8217;s a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming

thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
fie!</p>

<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now
with
me; but she&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, sir, was&#8217;t not the wise woman
of<br>
Brentford?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you
with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her,
seeing
her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
chain or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I spake with the old woman about it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">And what says she, I pray, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, she says that the very same man that
beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">I would I could have spoken with the woman
herself;
I had other things to have spoken with her too from
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What are they? let us know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, come; quick.</p>

<p class="speech">I may not conceal them, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Conceal them, or thou diest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress
Anne
Page; to know if it were my master&#8217;s fortune to
have her or no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis, &#8217;tis his fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">What, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Simple</p>
<p class="speech">May I be bold to say so, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; like who more bold.</p>

taught
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;

my learning.</p>

<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Where be my horses? speak well of them,
varletto.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bardolph</p>
<p class="speech">Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I
came
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>

<p class="speaker">Sir Hugh Evans</p>
<p class="speech">Have a care of your entertainments: there is
a
friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
&#8217;tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.</p>

dilemma.</p>

<p class="speech">I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me
dat
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.</p>

Bardolph</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">I would all the world might be cozened; for I
have
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
and how my transformation hath been washed and
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
drop and liquor fishermen&#8217;s boots with me; I warrant
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mistress
Quickly</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, whence come you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">From the two parties, forsooth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">The devil take one party and his dam the other!
and
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
of man&#8217;s disposition is able to bear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
white spot about her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Falstaff</p>
<p class="speech">What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i&#8217; the
stocks, i&#8217; the common stocks, for a witch.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mistress Quickly</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber:
you
shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
you are so crossed.</p>

<p class="speech">Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy:
I

<p class="speech">Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,<br>
And, as I am a gentleman, I&#8217;ll give thee<br>
A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at
the
least keep your counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fenton</p>
<p class="speech">From time to time I have acquainted you<br>
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;<br>
Who mutually hath answer&#8217;d my affection,<br>
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,<br>
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her<br>
Of such contents as you will wonder at;<br>
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,<br>
That neither singly can be manifested,<br>
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff<br>
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest<br>
I&#8217;ll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.<br>
To-night at Herne&#8217;s oak, just &#8217;twixt twelve and
one,<br>
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;<br>
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,<br>
While other jests are something rank on foot,<br>
Her father hath commanded her to slip<br>
Away with Slender and with him at Eton<br>
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,<br>
Her mother, ever strong against that match<br>
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed<br>
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,<br>
While other sports are tasking of their minds,<br>
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,<br>
Straight marry her: to this her mother&#8217;s plot<br>
She seemingly obedient likewise hath<br>
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:<br>
Her father means she shall be all in white,<br>
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<br>
To take her by the hand and bid her go,<br>
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,<br>
The better to denote her to the doctor,<br>
For they must all be mask&#8217;d and vizarded,<br>
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,<br>
With ribands pendent, flaring &#8217;bout her head;<br>
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,<br>
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,<br>
The maid hath given consent to go with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Which means she to deceive, father or mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fenton</p>
<p class="speech">Both, my good host, to go along with me:<br>
And here it rests, that you&#8217;ll procure the vicar<br>
To stay for me at church &#8217;twixt twelve and one,<br>
And, in the lawful name of marrying,<br>
To give our hearts united ceremony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Well, husband your device; I&#8217;ll to the
vicar:<br>
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fenton</p>
<p class="speech">So shall I evermore be bound to thee;<br>
Besides, I&#8217;ll make a present recompense.</p>
