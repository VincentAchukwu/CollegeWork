<h4>Scene I. A room in Leontes&#8217; palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Leontes, Cleomenes,
Dion, Paulina, and Servants</span></p>
<p id="bm613" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm613">Cleomenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you have done enough, and have
perform&#8217;d<br>
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,<br>
Which you have not redeem&#8217;d; indeed, paid down<br>
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,<br>
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;<br>
With them forgive yourself.</p>
<p id="bm614" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm614">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Whilst I remember<br>
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget<br>
My blemishes in them, and so still think of<br>
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,<br>
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and<br>
Destroy&#8217;d the sweet&#8217;st companion that e&#8217;er
man<br>
Bred his hopes out of.</p>
<p id="bm615" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm615">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">True, too true, my lord:<br>
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,<br>
Or from the all that are took something good,<br>
To make a perfect woman, she you kill&#8217;d<br>
Would be unparallel&#8217;d.</p>
<p id="bm616" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm616">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I think so. Kill&#8217;d!<br>
She I kill&#8217;d! I did so: but thou strikest me<br>
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter<br>
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,<br>
Say so but seldom.</p>
<p id="bm617" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm617">Cleomenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not at all, good lady:<br>
You might have spoken a thousand things that would<br>
Have done the time more benefit and graced<br>
Your kindness better.</p>
<p id="bm618" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm618">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">You are one of those<br>
Would have him wed again.</p>
<p id="bm619" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm619">Dion</a></p>
<p class="speech">If you would not so,<br>
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance<br>
Of his most sovereign name; consider little<br>
What dangers, by his highness&#8217; fail of issue,<br>
May drop upon his kingdom and devour<br>
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy<br>
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?<br>
What holier than, for royalty&#8217;s repair,<br>
For present comfort and for future good,<br>
To bless the bed of majesty again<br>
With a sweet fellow to&#8217;t?</p>
<p id="bm620" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm620">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">There is none worthy,<br>
Respecting her that&#8217;s gone. Besides, the gods<br>
Will have fulfill&#8217;d their secret purposes;<br>
For has not the divine Apollo said,<br>
Is&#8217;t not the tenor of his oracle,<br>
That King Leontes shall not have an heir<br>
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,<br>
Is all as monstrous to our human reason<br>
As my Antigonus to break his grave<br>
And come again to me; who, on my life,<br>
Did perish with the infant. &#8217;Tis your counsel<br>
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,<br>
Oppose against their wills.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Leontes</span></p>
<p class="speech">Care not for issue;<br>
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander<br>
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor<br>
Was like to be the best.</p>
<p id="bm621" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm621">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good Paulina,<br>
Who hast the memory of Hermione,<br>
I know, in honour, O, that ever I<br>
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,<br>
I might have look&#8217;d upon my queen&#8217;s full eyes,<br>
Have taken treasure from her lips&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm622" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm622">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">And left them<br>
More rich for what they yielded.</p>
<p id="bm623" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm623">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou speak&#8217;st truth.<br>
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,<br>
And better used, would make her sainted spirit<br>
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,<br>
Where we&#8217;re offenders now, appear soul-vex&#8217;d,<br>
And begin, &#8216;Why to me?&#8217;</p>
<p id="bm624" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm624">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Had she such power,<br>
She had just cause.</p>
<p id="bm625" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm625">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">She had; and would incense me<br>
To murder her I married.</p>
<p id="bm626" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm626">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I should so.<br>
Were I the ghost that walk&#8217;d, I&#8217;ld bid you mark<br>
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in&#8217;t<br>
You chose her; then I&#8217;ld shriek, that even your ears<br>
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow&#8217;d<br>
Should be &#8216;Remember mine.&#8217;</p>
<p id="bm627" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm627">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Stars, stars,<br>
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;<br>
I&#8217;ll have no wife, Paulina.</p>
<p id="bm628" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm628">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Will you swear<br>
Never to marry but by my free leave?</p>
<p id="bm629" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm629">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!</p>
<p id="bm630" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm630">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Then, good my lords, bear witness to his
oath.</p>
<p id="bm631" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm631">Cleomenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">You tempt him over-much.</p>
<p id="bm632" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm632">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Unless another,<br>
As like Hermione as is her picture,<br>
Affront his eye.</p>
<p id="bm633" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm633">Cleomenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Good madam,&#8212;</p>
<p id="bm634" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm634">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I have done.<br>
Yet, if my lord will marry,&#8212;if you will, sir,<br>
No remedy, but you will,&#8212;give me the office<br>
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young<br>
As was your former; but she shall be such<br>
As, walk&#8217;d your first queen&#8217;s ghost,
it should take joy<br>
To see her in your arms.</p>
<p id="bm635" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm635">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">My true Paulina,<br>
We shall not marry till thou bid&#8217;st us.</p>
<p id="bm636" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm636">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">That<br>
Shall be when your first queen&#8217;s again in breath;<br>
Never till then.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Gentleman</span></p>
<p id="bm637" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm637">Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,<br>
Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she<br>
The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access<br>
To your high presence.</p>
<p id="bm638" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm638">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">What with him? he comes not<br>
Like to his father&#8217;s greatness: his approach,<br>
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us<br>
&#8217;Tis not a visitation framed, but forced<br>
By need and accident. What train?</p>
<p id="bm639" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm639">Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">But few,<br>
And those but mean.</p>
<p id="bm640" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm640">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">His princess, say you, with him?</p>
<p id="bm641" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm641">Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I
think,<br>
That e&#8217;er the sun shone bright on.</p>
<p id="bm642" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm642">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">O Hermione,<br>
As every present time doth boast itself<br>
Above a better gone, so must thy grave<br>
Give way to what&#8217;s seen now! Sir, you yourself<br>
Have said and writ so, but your writing now<br>
Is colder than that theme, &#8216;she had not been,<br>
Nor was not to be equall&#8217;d;&#8217;&#8212;thus your verse<br>
Flow&#8217;d with her beauty once: &#8217;tis shrewdly
ebb&#8217;d,<br>
To say you have seen a better.</p>
<p id="bm643" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm643">Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Pardon, madam:<br>
The one I have almost forgot,&#8212;your pardon,&#8212;<br>
The other, when she has obtain&#8217;d your eye,<br>
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,<br>
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal<br>
Of all professors else, make proselytes<br>
Of who she but bid follow.</p>
<p id="bm644" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm644">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">How! not women?</p>
<p id="bm645" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm645">Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Women will love her, that she is a woman<br>
More worth than any man; men, that she is<br>
The rarest of all women.</p>
<p id="bm646" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm646">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Go, Cleomenes;<br>
Yourself, assisted with your honour&#8217;d friends,<br>
Bring them to our embracement. Still, &#8217;tis strange</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Cleomenes and
others</span></p>
<p class="speech">He thus should steal upon us.</p>
<p id="bm647" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm647">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Had our prince,<br>
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair&#8217;d<br>
Well with this lord: there was not full a month<br>
Between their births.</p>
<p id="bm648" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm648">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, no more; cease; thou know&#8217;st<br>
He dies to me again when talk&#8217;d of: sure,<br>
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches<br>
Will bring me to consider that which may<br>
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Cleomenes and
others, with Florizel and Perdita</span></p>
<p class="speech">Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;<br>
For she did print your royal father off,<br>
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,<br>
Your father&#8217;s image is so hit in you,<br>
His very air, that I should call you brother,<br>
As I did him, and speak of something wildly<br>
By us perform&#8217;d before. Most dearly welcome!<br>
And your fair princess,&#8212;goddess!&#8212;O, alas!<br>
I lost a couple, that &#8217;twixt heaven and earth<br>
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as<br>
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost&#8212;<br>
All mine own folly&#8212;the society,<br>
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,<br>
Though bearing misery, I desire my life<br>
Once more to look on him.</p>
<p id="bm649" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm649">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">By his command<br>
Have I here touch&#8217;d Sicilia and from him<br>
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,<br>
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity<br>
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized<br>
His wish&#8217;d ability, he had himself<br>
The lands and waters &#8217;twixt your throne and his<br>
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves&#8212;<br>
He bade me say so&#8212;more than all the sceptres<br>
And those that bear them living.</p>
<p id="bm650" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm650">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O my brother,<br>
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir<br>
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,<br>
So rarely kind, are as interpreters<br>
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,<br>
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too<br>
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,<br>
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,<br>
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less<br>
The adventure of her person?</p>
<p id="bm651" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm651">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,<br>
She came from Libya.</p>
<p id="bm652" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm652">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Where the warlike Smalus,<br>
That noble honour&#8217;d lord, is fear&#8217;d and loved?</p>
<p id="bm653" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm653">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose
daughter<br>
His tears proclaim&#8217;d his, parting with her: thence,<br>
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross&#8217;d,<br>
To execute the charge my father gave me<br>
For visiting your highness: my best train<br>
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss&#8217;d;<br>
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify<br>
Not only my success in Libya, sir,<br>
But my arrival and my wife&#8217;s in safety<br>
Here where we are.</p>
<p id="bm654" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm654">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The blessed gods<br>
Purge all infection from our air whilst you<br>
Do climate here! You have a holy father,<br>
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,<br>
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:<br>
For which the heavens, taking angry note,<br>
Have left me issueless; and your father&#8217;s blest,<br>
As he from heaven merits it, with you<br>
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,<br>
Might I a son and daughter now have look&#8217;d on,<br>
Such goodly things as you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Lord</span></p>
<p id="bm655" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm655">Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Most noble sir,<br>
That which I shall report will bear no credit,<br>
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,<br>
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;<br>
Desires you to attach his son, who has&#8212;<br>
His dignity and duty both cast off&#8212;<br>
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with<br>
A shepherd&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p id="bm656" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm656">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Bohemia? speak.</p>
<p id="bm657" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm657">Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Here in your city; I now came from him:<br>
I speak amazedly; and it becomes<br>
My marvel and my message. To your court<br>
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,<br>
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way<br>
The father of this seeming lady and<br>
Her brother, having both their country quitted<br>
With this young prince.</p>
<p id="bm658" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm658">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Camillo has betray&#8217;d me;<br>
Whose honour and whose honesty till now<br>
Endured all weathers.</p>
<p id="bm659" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm659">Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Lay&#8217;t so to his charge:<br>
He&#8217;s with the king your father.</p>
<p id="bm660" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm660">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who? Camillo?</p>
<p id="bm661" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm661">Lord</a></p>
<p class="speech">Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now<br>
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I<br>
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;<br>
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:<br>
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them<br>
With divers deaths in death.</p>
<p id="bm662" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm662">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">O my poor father!<br>
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have<br>
Our contract celebrated.</p>
<p id="bm663" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm663">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">You are married?</p>
<p id="bm664" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm664">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;<br>
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:<br>
The odds for high and low&#8217;s alike.</p>
<p id="bm665" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm665">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
Is this the daughter of a king?</p>
<p id="bm666" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm666">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">She is,<br>
When once she is my wife.</p>
<p id="bm667" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm667">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">That &#8216;once&#8217; I see by your good
father&#8217;s speed<br>
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,<br>
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking<br>
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry<br>
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,<br>
That you might well enjoy her.</p>
<p id="bm668" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm668">Florizel</a></p>
<p class="speech">Dear, look up:<br>
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,<br>
Should chase us with my father, power no jot<br>
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,<br>
Remember since you owed no more to time<br>
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,<br>
Step forth mine advocate; at your request<br>
My father will grant precious things as trifles.</p>
<p id="bm669" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm669">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Would he do so, I&#8217;ld beg your precious
mistress,<br>
Which he counts but a trifle.</p>
<p id="bm670" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm670">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Sir, my liege,<br>
Your eye hath too much youth in&#8217;t: not a month<br>
&#8217;Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes<br>
Than what you look on now.</p>
<p id="bm671" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm671">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">I thought of her,<br>
Even in these looks I made.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Florizel</span></p>
<p class="speech">But your petition<br>
Is yet unanswer&#8217;d. I will to your father:<br>
Your honour not o&#8217;erthrown by your desires,<br>
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand<br>
I now go toward him; therefore follow me<br>
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Before Leontes&#8217; palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Autolycus and a
Gentleman</span></p>
<p id="bm672" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm672">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this
relation?</p>
<p id="bm673" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm673">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the
old
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</p>
<p id="bm674" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm674">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</p>
<p id="bm675" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm675">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I make a broken delivery of the business; but
the
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter another
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.<br>
The news, Rogero?</p>
<p id="bm676" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm676">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled;
the
king&#8217;s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
cannot be able to express it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a third
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the Lady Paulina&#8217;s steward: he
can
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
which is called true is so like an old tale, that
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
found his heir?</p>
<p id="bm677" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm677">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
circumstance: that which you hear you&#8217;ll swear you
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
of Queen Hermione&#8217;s, her jewel about the neck of it,
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
know to be his character, the majesty of the
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
and many other evidences proclaim her with all
certainty to be the king&#8217;s daughter. Did you see
the meeting of the two kings?</p>
<p id="bm678" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm678">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p id="bm679" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm679">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Then have you lost a sight, which was to be
seen,
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
holding up of hands, with countenances of such
distraction that they were to be known by garment,
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
joy were now become a loss, cries &#8216;O, thy mother,
thy mother!&#8217; then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
conduit of many kings&#8217; reigns. I never heard of such
another encounter, which lames report to follow it
and undoes description to do it.</p>
<p id="bm680" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm680">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that
carried
hence the child?</p>
<p id="bm681" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm681">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Like an old tale still, which will have matter
to
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
avouches the shepherd&#8217;s son; who has not only his
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</p>
<p id="bm682" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm682">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">What became of his bark and his followers?</p>
<p id="bm683" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm683">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Wrecked the same instant of their master&#8217;s
death and
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
instruments which aided to expose the child were
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
combat that &#8217;twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
of losing.</p>
<p id="bm684" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm684">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">The dignity of this act was worth the audience
of
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</p>
<p id="bm685" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm685">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">One of the prettiest touches of all and that
which
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen&#8217;s
death, with the manner how she came to&#8217;t bravely
confessed and lamented by the king, how
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an &#8216;Alas,&#8217;
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
could have seen &#8217;t, the woe had been universal.</p>
<p id="bm686" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm686">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Are they returned to the court?</p>
<p id="bm687" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm687">Third Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">No: the princess hearing of her mother&#8217;s
statue,
which is in the keeping of Paulina,&#8212;a piece many
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
eternity and could put breath into his work, would
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
answer: thither with all greediness of affection
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>
<p id="bm688" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm688">Second Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">I thought she had some great matter there in
hand;
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
the rejoicing?</p>
<p id="bm689" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm689">First Gentleman</a></p>
<p class="speech">Who would be thence that has the benefit of
access?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
Let&#8217;s along.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gentlemen</span></p>
<p id="bm690" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm690">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in
me,
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
at that time, overfond of the shepherd&#8217;s daughter,
so he then took her to be, who began to be much
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
weather continuing, this mystery remained
undiscovered. But &#8217;tis all one to me; for had I
been the finder out of this secret, it would not
have relished among my other discredits.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Shepherd and
Clown</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here come those I have done good to against my
will,
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.</p>
<p id="bm691" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm691">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons
and
daughters will be all gentlemen born.</p>
<p id="bm692" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm692">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with
me
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
See you these clothes? say you see them not and
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</p>
<p id="bm693" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm693">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</p>
<p id="bm694" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm694">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and have been so any time these four
hours.</p>
<p id="bm695" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm695">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">And so have I, boy.</p>
<p id="bm696" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm696">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">So you have: but I was a gentleman born before
my
father; for the king&#8217;s son took me by the hand, and
called me brother; and then the two kings called my
father brother; and then the prince my brother and
the princess my sister called my father father; and
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
tears that ever we shed.</p>
<p id="bm697" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm697">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">We may live, son, to shed many more.</p>
<p id="bm698" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm698">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay; or else &#8217;twere hard luck, being in
so
preposterous estate as we are.</p>
<p id="bm699" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm699">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all
the
faults I have committed to your worship and to give
me your good report to the prince my master.</p>
<p id="bm700" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm700">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we
are
gentlemen.</p>
<p id="bm701" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm701">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Thou wilt amend thy life?</p>
<p id="bm702" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm702">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, an it like your good worship.</p>
<p id="bm703" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm703">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince
thou
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</p>
<p id="bm704" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm704">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">You may say it, but not swear it.</p>
<p id="bm705" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm705">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors
and
franklins say it, I&#8217;ll swear it.</p>
<p id="bm706" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm706">Shepherd</a></p>
<p class="speech">How if it be false, son?</p>
<p id="bm707" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm707">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">If it be ne&#8217;er so false, a true gentleman
may swear
it in the behalf of his friend: and I&#8217;ll swear to
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
drunk: but I&#8217;ll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
be a tall fellow of thy hands.</p>
<p id="bm708" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm708">Autolycus</a></p>
<p class="speech">I will prove so, sir, to my power.</p>
<p id="bm709" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm709">Clown</a></p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do
not
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
queen&#8217;s picture. Come, follow us: we&#8217;ll be thy
good masters.</p>

Florizel, Perdita, Camillo, Paulina, Lords, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p id="bm710" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm710">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort<br>
That I have had of thee!</p>
<p id="bm711" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm711">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">What, sovereign sir,<br>
I did not well I meant well. All my services<br>
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,<br>
With your crown&#8217;d brother and these your contracted<br>
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,<br>
It is a surplus of your grace, which never<br>
My life may last to answer.</p>
<p id="bm712" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm712">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O Paulina,<br>
We honour you with trouble: but we came<br>
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery<br>
Have we pass&#8217;d through, not without much content<br>
In many singularities; but we saw not<br>
That which my daughter came to look upon,<br>
The statue of her mother.</p>
<p id="bm713" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm713">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">As she lived peerless,<br>
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,<br>
Excels whatever yet you look&#8217;d upon<br>
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it<br>
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare<br>
To see the life as lively mock&#8217;d as ever<br>
Still sleep mock&#8217;d death: behold, and say &#8217;tis
well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Paulina draws a curtain, and
discovers Hermione standing like a statue</span></p>
<p class="speech">I like your silence, it the more shows off<br>
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,<br>
Comes it not something near?</p>
<p id="bm714" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm714">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Her natural posture!<br>
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed<br>
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she<br>
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender<br>
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,<br>
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing<br>
So aged as this seems.</p>
<p id="bm715" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm715">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, not by much.</p>
<p id="bm716" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm716">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">So much the more our carver&#8217;s
excellence;<br>
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her<br>
As she lived now.</p>
<p id="bm717" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm717">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;As now she might have done,<br>
So much to my good comfort, as it is<br>
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,<br>
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,<br>
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo&#8217;d her!<br>
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me<br>
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,<br>
There&#8217;s magic in thy majesty, which has<br>
My evils conjured to remembrance and<br>
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,<br>
Standing like stone with thee.</p>
<p id="bm718" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm718">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">And give me leave,<br>
And do not say &#8217;tis superstition, that<br>
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,<br>
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,<br>
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.</p>
<p id="bm719" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm719">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, patience!<br>
The statue is but newly fix&#8217;d, the colour&#8217;s<br>
Not dry.</p>
<p id="bm720" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm720">Camillo</a></p>
<p class="speech">My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,<br>
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,<br>
So many summers dry; scarce any joy<br>
Did ever so long live; no sorrow<br>
But kill&#8217;d itself much sooner.</p>
<p id="bm721" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm721">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Dear my brother,<br>
Let him that was the cause of this have power<br>
To take off so much grief from you as he<br>
Will piece up in himself.</p>
<p id="bm722" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm722">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, my lord,<br>
If I had thought the sight of my poor image<br>
Would thus have wrought you,&#8212;for the stone is mine&#8212;<br>
I&#8217;ld not have show&#8217;d it.</p>
<p id="bm723" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm723">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Do not draw the curtain.</p>
<p id="bm724" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm724">Paulina</a></p>

fancy<br>
May think anon it moves.</p>
<p id="bm725" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm725">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Let be, let be.<br>
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already&#8212;<br>
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,<br>
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins<br>
Did verily bear blood?</p>
<p id="bm726" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm726">Polixenes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Masterly done:<br>
The very life seems warm upon her lip.</p>

He&#8217;ll think anon it lives.</p>
<p id="bm729" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm729">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O sweet Paulina,<br>
Make me to think so twenty years together!<br>
No settled senses of the world can match<br>
The pleasure of that madness. Let &#8217;t alone.</p>
<p id="bm730" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm730">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr&#8217;d
you: but<br>
I could afflict you farther.</p>
<p id="bm731" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm731">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">Do, Paulina;<br>
For this affliction has a taste as sweet<br>
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,<br>
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel<br>
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<br>
For I will kiss her.</p>
<p id="bm732" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm732">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord, forbear:<br>
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;<br>
You&#8217;ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own<br>
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</p>
<p id="bm733" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm733">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">No, not these twenty years.</p>
<p id="bm734" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm734">Perdita</a></p>
<p class="speech">So long could I<br>
Stand by, a looker on.</p>
<p id="bm735" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm735">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">Either forbear,<br>
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you<br>
For more amazement. If you can behold it,<br>
I&#8217;ll make the statue move indeed, descend<br>
And take you by the hand; but then you&#8217;ll think&#8212;<br>
Which I protest against&#8212;I am assisted<br>
By wicked powers.</p>
<p id="bm736" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm736">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;What you can make her do,<br>
I am content to look on: what to speak,<br>
I am content to hear; for &#8217;tis as easy<br>
To make her speak as move.</p>
<p id="bm737" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm737">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">It is required<br>
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;<br>
On: those that think it is unlawful business<br>
I am about, let them depart.</p>
<p id="bm738" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm738">Leontes</a></p>

No foot shall stir.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis time; descend; be stone no more;
approach;<br>
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,<br>
I&#8217;ll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,<br>
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<br>
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Hermione comes
down</span></p>
<p class="speech">Start not; her actions shall be holy as<br>
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her<br>
Until you see her die again; for then<br>
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:<br>
When she was young you woo&#8217;d her; now in age<br>
Is she become the suitor?</p>
<p id="bm740" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm740">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, she&#8217;s warm!<br>
If this be magic, let it be an art<br>
Lawful as eating.</p>
<p id="bm741" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm741">Polixenes</a></p>

Or how stolen from the dead.</p>
<p id="bm744" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm744">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">That she is living,<br>
Were it but told you, should be hooted at<br>
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,<br>
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.<br>
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel<br>
And pray your mother&#8217;s blessing. Turn, good lady;<br>
Our Perdita is found.</p>
<p id="bm745" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm745">Hermione</a></p>
<p class="speech">You gods, look down<br>
And from your sacred vials pour your graces<br>
Upon my daughter&#8217;s head! Tell me, mine own.<br>
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found<br>
Thy father&#8217;s court? for thou shalt hear that I,<br>
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle<br>
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved<br>
Myself to see the issue.</p>
<p id="bm746" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm746">Paulina</a></p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s time enough for that;<br>
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble<br>
Your joys with like relation. Go together,<br>
You precious winners all; your exultation<br>
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,<br>
Will wing me to some wither&#8217;d bough and there<br>
My mate, that&#8217;s never to be found again,<br>
Lament till I am lost.</p>
<p id="bm747" class="speaker"><a class="bm" href="#bm747">Leontes</a></p>
<p class="speech">O, peace, Paulina!<br>
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<br>
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,<br>
And made between&#8217;s by vows. Thou hast found mine;<br>
But how, is to be question&#8217;d; for I saw her,<br>
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<br>
A prayer upon her grave. I&#8217;ll not seek far&#8212;<br>
For him, I partly know his mind&#8212;to find thee<br>
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,<br>
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<br>
Is richly noted and here justified<br>
By us, a pair of kings. Let&#8217;s from this place.<br>
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,<br>
That e&#8217;er I put between your holy looks<br>
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,<br>
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,<br>
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,<br>
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<br>
Each one demand an answer to his part<br>
Perform&#8217;d in this wide gap of time since first<br>
We were dissever&#8217;d: hastily lead away.</p>
