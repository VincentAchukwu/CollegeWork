Outlaws</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">If there be ten, shrink not, but down with
&#8217;em.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine and
Speed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about
ye:<br>
If not: we&#8217;ll make you sit and rifle you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, we are undone; these are the villains<br>
That all the travellers do fear so much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">My friends,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not so, sir: we are your
enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! we&#8217;ll hear him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by my beard, will we, for he&#8217;s a proper
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Then know that I have little wealth to lose:<br>
A man I am cross&#8217;d with adversity;<br>
My riches are these poor habiliments,<br>
Of which if you should here disfurnish me,<br>
You take the sum and substance that I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Whither travel you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To Verona.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Whence came you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">From Milan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Have you long sojourned there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Some sixteen months, and longer might have
stay&#8217;d,<br>
If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">What, were you banish&#8217;d thence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">For what offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">For that which now torments me to rehearse:<br>
I kill&#8217;d a man, whose death I much repent;<br>
Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,<br>
Without false vantage or base treachery.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Why, ne&#8217;er repent it, if it were done
so.<br>
But were you banish&#8217;d for so small a fault?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I was, and held me glad of such a doom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Have you the tongues?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">My youthful travel therein made me happy,<br>
Or else I often had been miserable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">By the bare scalp of Robin Hood&#8217;s fat
friar,<br>
This fellow were a king for our wild faction!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll have him. Sirs, a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Master, be one of them; it&#8217;s an honourable
kind of thievery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, villain!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but my fortune.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,<br>
Such as the fury of ungovern&#8217;d youth<br>
Thrust from the company of awful men:<br>
Myself was from Verona banished<br>
For practising to steal away a lady,<br>
An heir, and near allied unto the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,<br>
Who, in my mood, I stabb&#8217;d unto the heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">And I for such like petty crimes as these,<br>
But to the purpose&#8212;for we cite our faults,<br>
That they may hold excus&#8217;d our lawless lives;<br>
And partly, seeing you are beautified<br>
With goodly shape and by your own report<br>
A linguist and a man of such perfection<br>
As we do in our quality much want&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, because you are a banish&#8217;d man,<br>
Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:<br>
Are you content to be our general?<br>
To make a virtue of necessity<br>
And live, as we do, in this wilderness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou? wilt thou be of our
consort?<br>
Say ay, and be the captain of us all:<br>
We&#8217;ll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,<br>
Love thee as our commander and our king.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt not live to brag what we have
offer&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I take your offer and will live with you,<br>
Provided that you do no outrages<br>
On silly women or poor passengers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">No, we detest such vile base practises.<br>
Come, go with us, we&#8217;ll bring thee to our crews,<br>
And show thee all the treasure we have got,<br>
Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Milan. Outside the Duke&#8217;s palace, under
Silvia&#8217;s chamber.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Already have I been false to Valentine<br>
And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.<br>
Under the colour of commending him,<br>
I have access my own love to prefer:<br>
But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,<br>
To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.<br>
When I protest true loyalty to her,<br>
She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;<br>
When to her beauty I commend my vows,<br>
She bids me think how I have been forsworn<br>
In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:<br>
And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,<br>
The least whereof would quell a lover&#8217;s hope,<br>
Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,<br>
The more it grows and fawneth on her still.<br>
But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,<br>
And give some evening music to her ear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thurio and
Musicians</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before
us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love<br>
Will creep in service where it cannot go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Who? Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, Silvia; for your sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,<br>
Let&#8217;s tune, and to it lustily awhile.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, at a distance, Host,
and Julia in boy&#8217;s clothes</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Now, my young guest, methinks you&#8217;re
allycholly: I
pray you, why is it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Come, we&#8217;ll have you merry: I&#8217;ll
bring you where
you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">But shall I hear him speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that you shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That will be music.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Music plays</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, hark!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Is he among these?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Ay: but, peace! let&#8217;s hear &#8217;em.<br>
Song.<br>
Who is Silvia? what is she,<br>
That all our swains commend her?<br>
Holy, fair and wise is she;<br>
The heaven such grace did lend her,<br>
That she might admired be.<br>
Is she kind as she is fair?<br>
For beauty lives with kindness.<br>
Love doth to her eyes repair,<br>
To help him of his blindness,<br>
And, being help&#8217;d, inhabits there.<br>
Then to Silvia let us sing,<br>
That Silvia is excelling;<br>
She excels each mortal thing<br>
Upon the dull earth dwelling:<br>
To her let us garlands bring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">How now! are you sadder than you were before?
How
do you, man? the music likes you not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">You mistake; the musician likes me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Why, my pretty youth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">He plays false, father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">How? out of tune on the strings?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my
very
heart-strings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">You have a quick ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow
heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I perceive you delight not in music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit, when it jars so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Hark, what fine change is in the music!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that change is the spite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">You would have them always play but one
thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I would always have one play but one thing.<br>
But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on<br>
Often resort unto this gentlewoman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he
loved
her out of all nick.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Where is Launce?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
master&#8217;s command, he must carry for a present to his
lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! stand aside: the company parts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead<br>
That you shall say my cunning drift excels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Where meet we?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;At Saint Gregory&#8217;s well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell.</p>

Musicians</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, good even to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you for your music, gentlemen.<br>
Who is that that spake?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">One, lady, if you knew his pure heart&#8217;s
truth,<br>
You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, as I take it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;That I may compass yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">You have your wish; my will is even this:<br>
That presently you hie you home to bed.<br>
Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!<br>
Think&#8217;st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,<br>
To be seduced by thy flattery,<br>
That hast deceived so many with thy vows?<br>
Return, return, and make thy love amends.<br>
For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,<br>
I am so far from granting thy request<br>
That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,<br>
And by and by intend to chide myself<br>
Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;<br>
But she is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> &#8217;Twere
false, if I should speak it;<br>
For I am sure she is not buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend<br>
Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,<br>
I am betroth&#8217;d: and art thou not ashamed<br>
To wrong him with thy importunacy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">And so suppose am I; for in his grave<br>
Assure thyself my love is buried.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Go to thy lady&#8217;s grave and call hers
thence,<br>
Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He heard not
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,<br>
Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,<br>
The picture that is hanging in your chamber;<br>
To that I&#8217;ll speak, to that I&#8217;ll sigh and weep:<br>
For since the substance of your perfect self<br>
Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;<br>
And to your shadow will I make true love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If
&#8217;twere a substance, you would, sure,
deceive it,
And make it but a shadow, as I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I am very loath to be your idol, sir;<br>
But since your falsehood shall become you well<br>
To worship shadows and adore false shapes,<br>
Send to me in the morning and I&#8217;ll send it:<br>
And so, good rest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;As wretches have
o&#8217;ernight<br>
That wait for execution in the morn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Proteus and Silvia
severally</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Host, will you go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">By my halidom, I was fast asleep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Host</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think &#8217;tis
almost
day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; but it hath been the longest night<br>
That e&#8217;er I watch&#8217;d and the most heaviest.</p>

<p class="speech">This is the hour that Madam Silvia<br>

There&#8217;s some great matter she&#8217;ld employ me in.<br>
Madam, madam!</p>

<p class="speaker">Eglamour</p>
<p class="speech">As many, worthy lady, to yourself:<br>
According to your ladyship&#8217;s impose,<br>
I am thus early come to know what service<br>
It is your pleasure to command me in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman&#8212;<br>
Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not&#8212;<br>
Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish&#8217;d:<br>
Thou art not ignorant what dear good will<br>
I bear unto the banish&#8217;d Valentine,<br>
Nor how my father would enforce me marry<br>
Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.<br>
Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say<br>
No grief did ever come so near thy heart<br>
As when thy lady and thy true love died,<br>
Upon whose grave thou vow&#8217;dst pure chastity.<br>
Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,<br>
To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;<br>
And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,<br>
I do desire thy worthy company,<br>
Upon whose faith and honour I repose.<br>
Urge not my father&#8217;s anger, Eglamour,<br>
But think upon my grief, a lady&#8217;s grief,<br>
And on the justice of my flying hence,<br>
To keep me from a most unholy match,<br>
Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.<br>
I do desire thee, even from a heart<br>
As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,<br>
To bear me company and go with me:<br>
If not, to hide what I have said to thee,<br>
That I may venture to depart alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Eglamour</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I pity much your grievances;<br>
Which since I know they virtuously are placed,<br>
I give consent to go along with you,<br>
Recking as little what betideth me<br>
As much I wish all good befortune you.<br>
When will you go?</p>

<h4>Scene IV. The same.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Launce, with his his
Dog</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">When a man&#8217;s servant shall play the cur
with him,
look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
&#8216;thus I would teach a dog.&#8217; I was sent to deliver
him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
steps me to her trencher and steals her capon&#8217;s leg:
O, &#8217;tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
I think verily he had been hanged for&#8217;t; sure as I
live, he had suffered for&#8217;t; you shall judge. He
thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
gentlemanlike dogs under the duke&#8217;s table: he had
not been there&#8212;bless the mark!&#8212;a pissing while, but
all the chamber smelt him. &#8216;Out with the dog!&#8217; says
one: &#8216;What cur is that?&#8217; says another: &#8216;Whip
him
out&#8217; says the third: &#8216;Hang him up&#8217; says the
duke.
I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
whips the dogs: &#8216;Friend,&#8217; quoth I, &#8216;you mean to
whip
the dog?&#8217; &#8216;Ay, marry, do I,&#8217; quoth he. &#8216;You
do him
the more wrong,&#8217; quoth I; &#8216;&#8217;twas I did the thing
you
wot of.&#8217; He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
his servant? Nay, I&#8217;ll be sworn, I have sat in the
stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for&#8217;t.
Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
water against a gentlewoman&#8217;s farthingale? didst
thou ever see me do such a trick?</p>

<p class="speech">How now, you whoreson peasant!<br>
Where have you been these two days loitering?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you
bade me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And what says she to my little jewel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells
you
currish thanks is good enough for such a present.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But she received my dog?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought
him
back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What, didst thou offer her this from me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me
by
the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,<br>
Or ne&#8217;er return again into my sight.<br>
Away, I say! stay&#8217;st thou to vex me here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Launce</span></p>
<p class="speech">A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!<br>
Sebastian, I have entertained thee,<br>
Partly that I have need of such a youth<br>
That can with some discretion do my business,<br>
For &#8217;tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,<br>
But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,<br>
Which, if my augury deceive me not,<br>
Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:<br>
Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.<br>
Go presently and take this ring with thee,<br>
Deliver it to Madam Silvia:<br>
She loved me well deliver&#8217;d it to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">It seems you loved not her, to leave her
token.<br>
She is dead, belike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Not so; I think she lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Alas!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou cry &#8216;alas&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot choose<br>
But pity her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Wherefore shouldst thou pity
her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Because methinks that she loved you as well<br>
As you do love your lady Silvia:<br>
She dreams of him that has forgot her love;<br>
You dote on her that cares not for your love.<br>
&#8217;Tis pity love should be so contrary;<br>
And thinking of it makes me cry &#8216;alas!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Well, give her that ring and therewithal<br>
This letter. That&#8217;s her chamber. Tell my lady<br>
I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.<br>
Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,<br>
Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">How many women would do such a message?<br>
Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain&#8217;d<br>
A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.<br>
Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him<br>
That with his very heart despiseth me?<br>
Because he loves her, he despiseth me;<br>
Because I love him I must pity him.<br>
This ring I gave him when he parted from me,<br>
To bind him to remember my good will;<br>
And now am I, unhappy messenger,<br>
To plead for that which I would not obtain,<br>
To carry that which I would have refused,<br>
To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.<br>
I am my master&#8217;s true-confirmed love;<br>
But cannot be true servant to my master,<br>
Unless I prove false traitor to myself.<br>
Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly<br>
As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Silvia,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speech">Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean<br>
To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What would you with her, if that I be she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">If you be she, I do entreat your patience<br>
To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">From whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O, he sends you for a picture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Ursula, bring my picture here.<br>
Go give your master this: tell him from me,<br>
One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,<br>
Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, please you peruse this letter.&#8212;<br>
Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised<br>
Deliver&#8217;d you a paper that I should not:<br>
This is the letter to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, let me look on that again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">There, hold!<br>
I will not look upon your master&#8217;s lines:<br>
I know they are stuff&#8217;d with protestations<br>
And full of new-found oaths; which he will break<br>
As easily as I do tear his paper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">The more shame for him that he sends it me;<br>
For I have heard him say a thousand times<br>
His Julia gave it him at his departure.<br>
Though his false finger have profaned the ring,<br>
Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">She thanks you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">What say&#8217;st thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you, madam, that you tender her.<br>
Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou know her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Almost as well as I do know myself:<br>
To think upon her woes I do protest<br>
That I have wept a hundred several times.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">I think she doth; and that&#8217;s her cause of
sorrow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not passing fair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:<br>
When she did think my master loved her well,<br>
She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:<br>
But since she did neglect her looking-glass<br>
And threw her sun-expelling mask away,<br>
The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks<br>
And pinch&#8217;d the lily-tincture of her face,<br>
That now she is become as black as I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">How tall was she?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">About my stature; for at Pentecost,<br>
When all our pageants of delight were play&#8217;d,<br>
Our youth got me to play the woman&#8217;s part,<br>
And I was trimm&#8217;d in Madam Julia&#8217;s gown,<br>
Which served me as fit, by all men&#8217;s judgments,<br>
As if the garment had been made for me:<br>
Therefore I know she is about my height.<br>
And at that time I made her weep agood,<br>
For I did play a lamentable part:<br>
Madam, &#8217;twas Ariadne passioning<br>
For Theseus&#8217; perjury and unjust flight;<br>
Which I so lively acted with my tears<br>
That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,<br>
Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead<br>
If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.<br>
Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!<br>
I weep myself to think upon thy words.<br>
Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this<br>
For thy sweet mistress&#8217; sake, because thou lovest her.<br>
Farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Silvia, with
attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And she shall thank you for&#8217;t, if
e&#8217;er you know her.<br>
A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful<br>
I hope my master&#8217;s suit will be but cold,<br>
Since she respects my mistress&#8217; love so much.<br>
Alas, how love can trifle with itself!<br>
Here is her picture: let me see; I think,<br>
If I had such a tire, this face of mine<br>
Were full as lovely as is this of hers:<br>
And yet the painter flatter&#8217;d her a little,<br>
Unless I flatter with myself too much.<br>
Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:<br>
If that be all the difference in his love,<br>
I&#8217;ll get me such a colour&#8217;d periwig.<br>
Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:<br>
Ay, but her forehead&#8217;s low, and mine&#8217;s as high.<br>
What should it be that he respects in her<br>
But I can make respective in myself,<br>
If this fond Love were not a blinded god?<br>
Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,<br>
For &#8217;tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,<br>
Thou shalt be worshipp&#8217;d, kiss&#8217;d, loved and adored!<br>
And, were there sense in his idolatry,<br>
My substance should be statue in thy stead.<br>
I&#8217;ll use thee kindly for thy mistress&#8217; sake,<br>
That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,<br>
I should have scratch&#8217;d out your unseeing eyes<br>
To make my master out of love with thee!</p>
