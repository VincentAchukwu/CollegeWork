<h4>Scene I. King John&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King John, Queen
Elinor, Pembroke, Essex, Salisbury, and others, with
Chatillon</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with
us?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of
France<br>
In my behavior to the majesty,<br>
The borrow&#8217;d majesty, of England here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">A strange beginning: &#8216;borrow&#8217;d
majesty!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Philip of France, in right and true behalf<br>
Of thy deceased brother Geffrey&#8217;s son,<br>
Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim<br>
To this fair island and the territories,<br>
To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,<br>
Desiring thee to lay aside the sword<br>
Which sways usurpingly these several titles,<br>
And put these same into young Arthur&#8217;s hand,<br>
Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What follows if we disallow of this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">The proud control of fierce and bloody war,<br>
To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Here have we war for war and blood for blood,<br>
Controlment for controlment: so answer France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chatillon</p>
<p class="speech">Then take my king&#8217;s defiance from my
mouth,<br>
The farthest limit of my embassy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:<br>
Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;<br>
For ere thou canst report I will be there,<br>
The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:<br>
So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath<br>
And sullen presage of your own decay.<br>
An honourable conduct let him have:<br>
Pembroke, look to &#8217;t. Farewell, Chatillon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Chatillon and
Pembroke</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">What now, my son! have I not ever said<br>
How that ambitious Constance would not cease<br>
Till she had kindled France and all the world,<br>
Upon the right and party of her son?<br>
This might have been prevented and made whole<br>
With very easy arguments of love,<br>
Which now the manage of two kingdoms must<br>
With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Our strong possession and our right for us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Your strong possession much more than your
right,<br>
Or else it must go wrong with you and me:<br>
So much my conscience whispers in your ear,<br>
Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Sheriff</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Essex</p>
<p class="speech">My liege, here is the strangest controversy<br>
Come from country to be judged by you,<br>
That e&#8217;er I heard: shall I produce the men?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Let them approach.<br>
Our abbeys and our priories shall pay<br>
This expedition&#8217;s charge.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Robert and the
Bastard</span></p>
<p class="speech">What men are you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Your faithful subject I, a gentleman<br>
Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,<br>
As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,<br>
A soldier, by the honour-giving hand<br>
Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What art thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?<br>
You came not of one mother then, it seems.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Most certain of one mother, mighty king;<br>
That is well known; and, as I think, one father:<br>
But for the certain knowledge of that truth<br>
I put you o&#8217;er to heaven and to my mother:<br>
Of that I doubt, as all men&#8217;s children may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy
mother<br>
And wound her honour with this diffidence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;<br>
That is my brother&#8217;s plea and none of mine;<br>
The which if he can prove, a&#8217; pops me out<br>
At least from fair five hundred pound a year:<br>
Heaven guard my mother&#8217;s honour and my land!</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,<br>
Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">I know not why, except to get the land.<br>
But once he slander&#8217;d me with bastardy:<br>
But whether I be as true begot or no,<br>
That still I lay upon my mother&#8217;s head,<br>
But that I am as well begot, my liege,&#8212;<br>
Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!&#8212;<br>
Compare our faces and be judge yourself.<br>
If old sir Robert did beget us both<br>
And were our father and this son like him,<br>
O old sir Robert, father, on my knee<br>
I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion&#8217;s
face;<br>
The accent of his tongue affecteth him.<br>
Do you not read some tokens of my son<br>
In the large composition of this man?</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eye hath well examined his parts<br>
And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,<br>
What doth move you to claim your brother&#8217;s land?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Because he hath a half-face, like my father.<br>
With half that face would he have all my land:<br>
A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious liege, when that my father lived,<br>
Your brother did employ my father much,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:<br>
Your tale must be how he employ&#8217;d my mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">And once dispatch&#8217;d him in an embassy<br>
To Germany, there with the emperor<br>
To treat of high affairs touching that time.<br>
The advantage of his absence took the king<br>
And in the mean time sojourn&#8217;d at my father&#8217;s;<br>
Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,<br>
But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores<br>
Between my father and my mother lay,<br>
As I have heard my father speak himself,<br>
When this same lusty gentleman was got.<br>
Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath&#8217;d<br>
His lands to me, and took it on his death<br>
That this my mother&#8217;s son was none of his;<br>
And if he were, he came into the world<br>
Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.<br>
Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,<br>
My father&#8217;s land, as was my father&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;<br>
Your father&#8217;s wife did after wedlock bear him,<br>
And if she did play false, the fault was hers;<br>
Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands<br>
That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,<br>
Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,<br>
Had of your father claim&#8217;d this son for his?<br>
In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept<br>
This calf bred from his cow from all the world;<br>
In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother&#8217;s,<br>
My brother might not claim him; nor your father,<br>
Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;<br>
My mother&#8217;s son did get your father&#8217;s heir;<br>
Your father&#8217;s heir must have your father&#8217;s land.</p>
<p class="speaker">Robert</p>
<p class="speech">Shall then my father&#8217;s will be of no
force<br>
To dispossess that child which is not his?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,<br>
Than was his will to get me, as I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge<br>
And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,<br>
Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,<br>
Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, an if my brother had my shape,<br>
And I had his, sir Robert&#8217;s his, like him;<br>
And if my legs were two such riding-rods,<br>
My arms such eel-skins stuff&#8217;d, my face so thin<br>
That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose<br>
Lest men should say &#8216;Look, where three-farthings
goes!&#8217;<br>
And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,<br>
Would I might never stir from off this place,<br>
I would give it every foot to have this face;<br>
I would not be sir Nob in any case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy
fortune,<br>
Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?<br>
I am a soldier and now bound to France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, take you my land, I&#8217;ll take my
chance.<br>
Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,<br>
Yet sell your face for five pence and &#8217;tis dear.<br>
Madam, I&#8217;ll follow you unto the death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Our country manners give our betters way.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">What is thy name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,<br>
Philip, good old sir Robert&#8217;s wife&#8217;s eldest son.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">From henceforth bear his name whose form thou
bear&#8217;st:<br>
Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,<br>
Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother by the mother&#8217;s side, give me your
hand:<br>
My father gave me honour, yours gave land.<br>
Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,<br>
When I was got, sir Robert was away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Elinor</p>
<p class="speech">The very spirit of Plantagenet!<br>
I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, by chance but not by truth; what
though?<br>
Something about, a little from the right,<br>
In at the window, or else o&#8217;er the hatch:<br>
Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,<br>
And have is have, however men do catch:<br>
Near or far off, well won is still well shot,<br>
And I am I, howe&#8217;er I was begot.</p>
<p class="speaker">King John</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;<br>
A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.<br>
Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed<br>
For France, for France, for it is more than need.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!<br>
For thou wast got i&#8217; the way of honesty.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Bastard</span></p>
<p class="speech">A foot of honour better than I was;<br>
But many a many foot of land the worse.<br>
Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.<br>
&#8216;Good den, sir Richard!&#8217;&#8212;&#8216;God-a-mercy,
fellow!&#8217;&#8212;<br>
And if his name be George, I&#8217;ll call him Peter;<br>
For new-made honour doth forget men&#8217;s names;<br>
&#8217;Tis too respective and too sociable<br>
For your conversion. Now your traveller,<br>
He and his toothpick at my worship&#8217;s mess,<br>
And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,<br>
Why then I suck my teeth and catechise<br>
My picked man of countries: &#8216;My dear sir,&#8217;<br>
Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,<br>
&#8216;I shall beseech you&#8217;&#8212;that is question now;<br>
And then comes answer like an Absey book:<br>
&#8216;O sir,&#8217; says answer, &#8216;at your best command;<br>
At your employment; at your service, sir;&#8217;<br>
&#8216;No, sir,&#8217; says question, &#8216;I, sweet sir, at
yours:&#8217;<br>
And so, ere answer knows what question would,<br>
Saving in dialogue of compliment,<br>
And talking of the Alps and Apennines,<br>
The Pyrenean and the river Po,<br>
It draws toward supper in conclusion so.<br>
But this is worshipful society<br>
And fits the mounting spirit like myself,<br>
For he is but a bastard to the time<br>
That doth not smack of observation;<br>
And so am I, whether I smack or no;<br>
And not alone in habit and device,<br>
Exterior form, outward accoutrement,<br>
But from the inward motion to deliver<br>
Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age&#8217;s tooth:<br>
Which, though I will not practise to deceive,<br>
Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;<br>
For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.<br>
But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?<br>
What woman-post is this? hath she no husband<br>
That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lady Faulconbridge and
Gurney</span></p>
<p class="speech">O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!<br>
What brings you here to court so hastily?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Where is that slave, thy brother? where is
he,<br>
That holds in chase mine honour up and down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">My brother Robert? old sir Robert&#8217;s
son?<br>
Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?<br>
Is it sir Robert&#8217;s son that you seek so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Robert&#8217;s son! Ay, thou unreverend
boy,<br>
Sir Robert&#8217;s son: why scorn&#8217;st thou at sir Robert?<br>
He is sir Robert&#8217;s son, and so art thou.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gurney</p>
<p class="speech">Good leave, good Philip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Philip! sparrow: James,<br>
There&#8217;s toys abroad: anon I&#8217;ll tell thee more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Gurney</span></p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I was not old sir Robert&#8217;s son:<br>
Sir Robert might have eat his part in me<br>
Upon Good-Friday and ne&#8217;er broke his fast:<br>
Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,<br>
Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:<br>
We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,<br>
To whom am I beholding for these limbs?<br>
Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,<br>
That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?<br>
What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.<br>
What! I am dubb&#8217;d! I have it on my shoulder.<br>
But, mother, I am not sir Robert&#8217;s son;<br>
I have disclaim&#8217;d sir Robert and my land;<br>
Legitimation, name and all is gone:<br>
Then, good my mother, let me know my father;<br>
Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">As faithfully as I deny the devil.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Faulconbridge</p>
<p class="speech">King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:<br>
By long and vehement suit I was seduced<br>
To make room for him in my husband&#8217;s bed:<br>
Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!<br>
Thou art the issue of my dear offence,<br>
Which was so strongly urged past my defence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bastard</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by this light, were I to get again,<br>
Madam, I would not wish a better father.<br>
Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,<br>
And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:<br>
Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,<br>
Subjected tribute to commanding love,<br>
Against whose fury and unmatched force<br>
The aweless lion could not wage the fight,<br>
Nor keep his princely heart from Richard&#8217;s hand.<br>
He that perforce robs lions of their hearts<br>
May easily win a woman&#8217;s. Ay, my mother,<br>
With all my heart I thank thee for my father!<br>
Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well<br>
When I was got, I&#8217;ll send his soul to hell.<br>
Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;<br>
And they shall say, when Richard me begot,<br>
If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:<br>
Who says it was, he lies; I say &#8217;twas not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
