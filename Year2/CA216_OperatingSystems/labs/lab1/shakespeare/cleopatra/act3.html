<h4>Scene I. A plain in Syria.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Ventidius as it were in
triumph, with Silius, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the
dead body of Pacorus borne before him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and
now<br>
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus&#8217; death<br>
Make me revenger. Bear the king&#8217;s son&#8217;s body<br>
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,<br>
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silius</p>
<p class="speech">Noble Ventidius,<br>
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,<br>
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,<br>
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither<br>
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony<br>
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and<br>
Put garlands on thy head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">O Silius, Silius,<br>
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,<br>
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;<br>
Better to leave undone, than by our deed<br>
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve&#8217;s away.<br>
Caesar and Antony have ever won<br>
More in their officer than person: Sossius,<br>
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,<br>
For quick accumulation of renown,<br>
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.<br>
Who does i&#8217; the wars more than his captain can<br>
Becomes his captain&#8217;s captain: and ambition,<br>
The soldier&#8217;s virtue, rather makes choice of loss,<br>
Than gain which darkens him.<br>
I could do more to do Antonius good,<br>
But &#8217;twould offend him; and in his offence<br>
Should my performance perish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silius</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast, Ventidius,
that<br>
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,<br>
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll humbly signify what in his name,<br>
That magical word of war, we have effected;<br>
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,<br>
The ne&#8217;er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia<br>
We have jaded out o&#8217; the field.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silius</p>
<p class="speech">Where is he now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Ventidius</p>
<p class="speech">He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what
haste<br>
The weight we must convey with&#8217;s will permit,<br>
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!</p>

house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Agrippa at one door,
Domitius Enobarbus at another</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">What, are the brothers parted?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">They have dispatch&#8217;d with Pompey, he is
gone;<br>
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps<br>
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,<br>
Since Pompey&#8217;s feast, as Menas says, is troubled<br>
With the green sickness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis a noble Lepidus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar? Why, he&#8217;s the Jupiter of men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s Antony? The god of Jupiter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Would you praise Caesar, say
&#8216;Caesar:&#8217; go no further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed, he plied them both with excellent
praises.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves
Antony:<br>
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot<br>
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!<br>
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,<br>
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Both he loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">They are his shards, and he their beetle.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets within</span></p>
<p class="speech">So;<br>
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Octavius Caesar, Mark
Antony, Lepidus, and Octavia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">No further, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">You take from me a great part of myself;<br>
Use me well in &#8217;t. Sister, prove such a wife<br>
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band<br>
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,<br>
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set<br>
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,<br>
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter<br>
The fortress of it; for better might we<br>
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts<br>
This be not cherish&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Make me not offended<br>
In your distrust.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I have said.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not find,<br>
Though you be therein curious, the least cause<br>
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,<br>
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!<br>
We will here part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:<br>
The elements be kind to thee, and make<br>
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">My noble brother!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">The April &#8217;s in her eyes: it is
love&#8217;s spring,<br>
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, look well to my husband&#8217;s house;
and&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What, Octavia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I&#8217;ll tell you in your
ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can<br>
Her heart inform her tongue,&#8212;the swan&#8217;s
down-feather,<br>
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,<br>
And neither way inclines.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Agrippa]</span>
Will Caesar weep?</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Domitius
Enobarbus]</span> He has a cloud in &#8217;s face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Agrippa]</span> He
were the worse for that,
were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Domitius
Enobarbus]</span> Why, Enobarbus,<br>
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,<br>
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept<br>
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Agrippa]</span>
That year, indeed, he was
troubled with a rheum;<br>
What willingly he did confound he wail&#8217;d,<br>
Believe&#8217;t, till I wept too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">No, sweet Octavia,<br>
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not<br>
Out-go my thinking on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, come;<br>
I&#8217;ll wrestle with you in my strength of love:<br>
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,<br>
And give you to the gods.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu; be happy!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lepidus</p>
<p class="speech">Let all the number of the stars give light<br>
To thy fair way!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>

<p class="speech">Good majesty,<br>
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you<br>
But when you are well pleased.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That Herod&#8217;s head<br>
I&#8217;ll have: but how, when Antony is gone<br>
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, in Rome;<br>
I look&#8217;d her in the face, and saw her led<br>
Between her brother and Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Is she as tall as me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">She is not, madam.</p>

low?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s not so good: he cannot like her
long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Like her! O Isis! &#8217;tis impossible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and
dwarfish!<br>
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,<br>
If e&#8217;er thou look&#8217;dst on majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">She creeps:<br>
Her motion and her station are as one;<br>
She shows a body rather than a life,<br>
A statue than a breather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Is this certain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Or I have no observance.</p>

I do perceive&#8217;t: there&#8217;s nothing in her yet:<br>
The fellow has good judgment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Excellent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Guess at her years, I prithee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>

She was a widow,&#8212;</p>

long or round?</p>

<p class="speech">Round even to faultiness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">For the most part, too, they are foolish that are
so.<br>
Her hair, what colour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Brown, madam: and her forehead<br>
As low as she would wish it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s gold for thee.<br>
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:<br>
I will employ thee back again; I find thee<br>
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;<br>

That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,<br>
This creature&#8217;s no such thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Charmian</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing, madam.</p>

<p class="speech">The man hath seen some majesty, and should
know.</p>

<p class="speech">Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,<br>
And serving you so long!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I have one thing more to ask him yet, good
Charmian:<br>
But &#8217;tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me<br>

That were excusable, that, and thousands more<br>
Of semblable import,&#8212;but he hath waged<br>
New wars &#8217;gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it<br>
To public ear:<br>
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not<br>
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly<br>
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:<br>
When the best hint was given him, he not took&#8217;t,<br>
Or did it from his teeth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>

Praying for both parts:<br>
The good gods me presently,<br>
When I shall pray, &#8216;O bless my lord and husband!&#8217;<br>
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,<br>
&#8216;O, bless my brother!&#8217; Husband win, win brother,<br>
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway<br>
&#8217;Twixt these extremes at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle Octavia,<br>
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks<br>
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,<br>
I lose myself: better I were not yours<br>
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,<br>
Yourself shall go between &#8217;s: the mean time, lady,<br>
I&#8217;ll raise the preparation of a war<br>
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;<br>
So your desires are yours.</p>

<p class="speech">Thanks to my lord.<br>
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,<br>
Your reconciler! Wars &#8217;twixt you twain would be<br>
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men<br>
Should solder up the rift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">When it appears to you where this begins,<br>
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults<br>
Can never be so equal, that your love<br>
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;<br>
Choose your own company, and command what cost<br>
Your heart has mind to.</p>

Caesar!</p>

<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">You have not call&#8217;d me so, nor have you
cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Why have you stol&#8217;n upon us thus! You come
not<br>
Like Caesar&#8217;s sister: the wife of Antony<br>
Should have an army for an usher, and<br>
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach<br>
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way<br>
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,<br>
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust<br>
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,<br>
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come<br>
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented<br>
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,<br>
Is often left unloved; we should have met you<br>
By sea and land; supplying every stage<br>
With an augmented greeting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,<br>
To come thus was I not constrain&#8217;d, but did<br>
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,<br>
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted<br>
My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg&#8217;d<br>
His pardon for return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Which soon he granted,<br>
Being an obstruct &#8217;tween his lust and him.</p>

<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>

And his affairs come to me on the wind.<br>
Where is he now?</p>

<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, in Athens.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra<br>
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire<br>
Up to a whore; who now are levying<br>
The kings o&#8217; the earth for war; he hath assembled<br>
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,<br>
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king<br>
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;<br>
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;<br>
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king<br>
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,<br>
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,<br>
With a more larger list of sceptres.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me, most wretched,<br>
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends<br>
That do afflict each other!</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome hither:<br>
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;<br>
Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,<br>
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;<br>
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives<br>
O&#8217;er your content these strong necessities;<br>
But let determined things to destiny<br>
Hold unbewail&#8217;d their way. Welcome to Rome;<br>
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused<br>
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,<br>
To do you justice, make them ministers<br>
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;<br>
And ever welcome to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Agrippa</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mecaenas</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, dear madam.<br>
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:<br>
Only the adulterous Antony, most large<br>
In his abominations, turns you off;<br>
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,<br>
That noises it against us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavia</p>
<p class="speech">Is it so, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>

The ne&#8217;er touch&#8217;d vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;<br>
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we<br>
Will answer as a law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, I go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Octavius Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,<br>
And what thou think&#8217;st his very action speaks<br>
In every power that moves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar, I shall.</p>

<h4>Scene XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cleopatra, Domitius
Enobarbus, Charmian, and Iras</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">What shall we do, Enobarbus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Think, and die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Is Antony or we in fault for this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Antony only, that would make his will<br>
Lord of his reason. What though you fled<br>
From that great face of war, whose several ranges<br>
Frighted each other? why should he follow?<br>
The itch of his affection should not then<br>
Have nick&#8217;d his captainship; at such a point,<br>
When half to half the world opposed, he being<br>
The meered question: &#8217;twas a shame no less<br>
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,<br>
And leave his navy gazing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, peace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mark Antony with
Euphronius, the Ambassador</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Is that his answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Euphronius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">The queen shall then have courtesy, so she<br>
Will yield us up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Euphronius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He says so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Let her know&#8217;t.<br>
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,<br>
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim<br>
With principalities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That head, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">To him again: tell him he wears the rose<br>
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note<br>
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,<br>
May be a coward&#8217;s; whose ministers would prevail<br>
Under the service of a child as soon<br>
As i&#8217; the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore<br>
To lay his gay comparisons apart,<br>
And answer me declined, sword against sword,<br>
Ourselves alone. I&#8217;ll write it: follow me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mark Antony and
Euphronius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Yes, like
enough, high-battled Caesar will<br>
Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,<br>
Against a sworder! I see men&#8217;s judgments are<br>
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward<br>
Do draw the inward quality after them,<br>
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,<br>
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will<br>
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued<br>
His judgment too.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;A messenger from Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">What, no more ceremony? See, my women!<br>
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose<br>
That kneel&#8217;d unto the buds. Admit him, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Mine honesty
and I begin to square.<br>
The loyalty well held to fools does make<br>
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure<br>
To follow with allegiance a fall&#8217;n lord<br>
Does conquer him that did his master conquer<br>
And earns a place i&#8217; the story.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thyreus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Caesar&#8217;s will?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">Hear it apart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;None but friends: say boldly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">So, haply, are they friends to Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;<br>
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master<br>
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,<br>
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">So.<br>
Thus then, thou most renown&#8217;d: Caesar entreats,<br>
Not to consider in what case thou stand&#8217;st,<br>
Further than he is Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Go on: right royal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">He knows that you embrace not Antony<br>
As you did love, but as you fear&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">O!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">The scars upon your honour, therefore, he<br>
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,<br>
Not as deserved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He is a god, and knows<br>
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,<br>
But conquer&#8217;d merely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> To be sure of
that,<br>
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,<br>
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for<br>
Thy dearest quit thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I say to Caesar<br>
What you require of him? for he partly begs<br>
To be desired to give. It much would please him,<br>
That of his fortunes you should make a staff<br>
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,<br>
To hear from me you had left Antony,<br>
And put yourself under his shrowd,<br>
The universal landlord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s your name?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">My name is Thyreus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Most kind messenger,<br>
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation<br>
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt<br>
To lay my crown at &#8217;s feet, and there to kneel:<br>
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear<br>
The doom of Egypt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis your noblest course.<br>
Wisdom and fortune combating together,<br>
If that the former dare but what it can,<br>
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay<br>
My duty on your hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Your Caesar&#8217;s father oft,<br>
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,<br>
Bestow&#8217;d his lips on that unworthy place,<br>
As it rain&#8217;d kisses.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Mark Antony and
Domitius Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Favours, by Jove that thunders!<br>
What art thou, fellow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">One that but performs<br>
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest<br>
To have command obey&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> You will be
whipp&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
and devils!<br>
Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried
&#8217;Ho!&#8217;<br>
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,<br>
And cry &#8216;Your will?&#8217; Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">Take hence this Jack, and whip him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> &#8217;Tis
better playing with a lion&#8217;s whelp<br>
Than with an old one dying.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Moon and stars!<br>
Whip him. Were&#8217;t twenty of the greatest tributaries<br>
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them<br>
So saucy with the hand of she here,&#8212;what&#8217;s her
name,<br>
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,<br>
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,<br>
And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thyreus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Tug him away: being
whipp&#8217;d,<br>
Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar&#8217;s shall<br>
Bear us an errand to him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Attendants with
Thyreus</span></p>
<p class="speech">You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!<br>
Have I my pillow left unpress&#8217;d in Rome,<br>
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,<br>
And by a gem of women, to be abused<br>
By one that looks on feeders?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You have been a boggler ever:<br>
But when we in our viciousness grow hard&#8212;<br>
O misery on&#8217;t!&#8212;the wise gods seel our eyes;<br>
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us<br>
Adore our errors; laugh at&#8217;s, while we strut<br>
To our confusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, is&#8217;t come to this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I found you as a morsel cold upon<br>
Dead Caesar&#8217;s trencher; nay, you were a fragment<br>
Of Cneius Pompey&#8217;s; besides what hotter hours,<br>
Unregister&#8217;d in vulgar fame, you have<br>
Luxuriously pick&#8217;d out: for, I am sure,<br>
Though you can guess what temperance should be,<br>
You know not what it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">To let a fellow that will take rewards<br>
And say &#8216;God quit you!&#8217; be familiar with<br>
My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal<br>
And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were<br>
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar<br>
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;<br>
And to proclaim it civilly, were like<br>
A halter&#8217;d neck which does the hangman thank<br>
For being yare about him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendants with
Thyreus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Is he whipp&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">Soundly, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Cried he? and begg&#8217;d a&#8217;
pardon?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Attendant</p>
<p class="speech">He did ask favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">If that thy father live, let him repent<br>
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry<br>
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since<br>
Thou hast been whipp&#8217;d for following him: henceforth<br>
The white hand of a lady fever thee,<br>
Shake thou to look on &#8217;t. Get thee back to Caesar,<br>
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say<br>
He makes me angry with him; for he seems<br>
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,<br>
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;<br>
And at this time most easy &#8217;tis to do&#8217;t,<br>
When my good stars, that were my former guides,<br>
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires<br>
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike<br>
My speech and what is done, tell him he has<br>
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom<br>
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,<br>
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:<br>
Hence with thy stripes, begone!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Thyreus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Have you done yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Alack, our terrene moon<br>
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone<br>
The fall of Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">I must stay his time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes<br>
With one that ties his points?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Not know me yet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Cold-hearted toward me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, dear, if I be so,<br>
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,<br>
And poison it in the source; and the first stone<br>
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so<br>
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!<br>
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,<br>
Together with my brave Egyptians all,<br>
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,<br>
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile<br>
Have buried them for prey!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I am satisfied.<br>
Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where<br>
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land<br>
Hath nobly held; our sever&#8217;d navy too<br>
Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.<br>
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?<br>
If from the field I shall return once more<br>
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;<br>
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:<br>
There&#8217;s hope in&#8217;t yet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s my brave lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I will be treble-sinew&#8217;d, hearted,
breathed,<br>
And fight maliciously: for when mine hours<br>
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives<br>
Of me for jests; but now I&#8217;ll set my teeth,<br>
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,<br>
Let&#8217;s have one other gaudy night: call to me<br>
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;<br>
Let&#8217;s mock the midnight bell.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">It is my birth-day:<br>
I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord<br>
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">We will yet do well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cleopatra</p>
<p class="speech">Call all his noble captains to my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mark Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Do so, we&#8217;ll speak to them; and to-night
I&#8217;ll force<br>
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;<br>
There&#8217;s sap in&#8217;t yet. The next time I do fight,<br>
I&#8217;ll make death love me; for I will contend<br>
Even with his pestilent scythe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Domitius
Enobarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Domitius Enobarbus</p>
<p class="speech">Now he&#8217;ll outstare the lightning. To be
furious,<br>
Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood<br>
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,<br>
A diminution in our captain&#8217;s brain<br>
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,<br>
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek<br>
Some way to leave him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
