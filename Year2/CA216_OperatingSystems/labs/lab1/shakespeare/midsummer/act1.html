<h4>Scene I. Athens. The palace of Theseus.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Theseus, Hippolyta,
Philostrate, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<br>
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in<br>
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow<br>
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,<br>
Like to a step-dame or a dowager<br>
Long withering out a young man&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Four days will quickly steep themselves in
night;<br>
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<br>
And then the moon, like to a silver bow<br>
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night<br>
Of our solemnities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Philostrate,<br>
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;<br>
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;<br>
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<br>
The pale companion is not for our pomp.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Philostrate</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hippolyta, I woo&#8217;d thee with my sword,<br>
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;<br>
But I will wed thee in another key,<br>
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Egeus, Hermia,
Lysander, and Demetrius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, good Egeus: what&#8217;s the news with
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<br>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<br>
This man hath my consent to marry her.<br>
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,<br>
This man hath bewitch&#8217;d the bosom of my child;<br>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<br>
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:<br>
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<br>
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,<br>
And stolen the impression of her fantasy<br>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,<br>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers<br>
Of strong prevailment in unharden&#8217;d youth:<br>
With cunning hast thou filch&#8217;d my daughter&#8217;s heart,<br>
Turn&#8217;d her obedience, which is due to me,<br>
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,<br>
Be it so she will not here before your grace<br>
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,<br>
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:<br>
Which shall be either to this gentleman<br>
Or to her death, according to our law<br>
Immediately provided in that case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:<br>
To you your father should be as a god;<br>
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one<br>
To whom you are but as a form in wax<br>
By him imprinted and within his power<br>
To leave the figure or disfigure it.<br>
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">So is Lysander.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In himself he is;<br>
But in this kind, wanting your father&#8217;s voice,<br>
The other must be held the worthier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I would my father look&#8217;d but with my
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I do entreat your grace to pardon me.<br>
I know not by what power I am made bold,<br>
Nor how it may concern my modesty,<br>
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;<br>
But I beseech your grace that I may know<br>
The worst that may befall me in this case,<br>
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Either to die the death or to abjure<br>
For ever the society of men.<br>
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;<br>
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br>
Whether, if you yield not to your father&#8217;s choice,<br>
You can endure the livery of a nun,<br>
For aye to be in shady cloister mew&#8217;d,<br>
To live a barren sister all your life,<br>
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<br>
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,<br>
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;<br>
But earthlier happy is the rose distill&#8217;d,<br>
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn<br>
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<br>
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up<br>
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke<br>
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Take time to pause; and, by the next new
moon&#8212;<br>
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,<br>
For everlasting bond of fellowship&#8212;<br>
Upon that day either prepare to die<br>
For disobedience to your father&#8217;s will,<br>
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;<br>
Or on Diana&#8217;s altar to protest<br>
For aye austerity and single life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield<br>
Thy crazed title to my certain right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">You have her father&#8217;s love, Demetrius;<br>
Let me have Hermia&#8217;s: do you marry him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,<br>
And what is mine my love shall render him.<br>
And she is mine, and all my right of her<br>
I do estate unto Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<br>
As well possess&#8217;d; my love is more than his;<br>
My fortunes every way as fairly rank&#8217;d,<br>
If not with vantage, as Demetrius&#8217;;<br>
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<br>
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:<br>
Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br>
Demetrius, I&#8217;ll avouch it to his head,<br>
Made love to Nedar&#8217;s daughter, Helena,<br>
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br>
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br>
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">I must confess that I have heard so much,<br>
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<br>
But, being over-full of self-affairs,<br>
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;<br>
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,<br>
I have some private schooling for you both.<br>
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<br>
To fit your fancies to your father&#8217;s will;<br>
Or else the law of Athens yields you up&#8212;<br>
Which by no means we may extenuate&#8212;<br>
To death, or to a vow of single life.<br>
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?<br>
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:<br>
I must employ you in some business<br>
Against our nuptial and confer with you<br>
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">With duty and desire we follow you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Lysander and
Hermia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?<br>
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Belike for want of rain, which I could well<br>
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,<br>
Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>
The course of true love never did run smooth;<br>
But, either it was different in blood,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O cross! too high to be enthrall&#8217;d to
low.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or else misgraffed in respect of
years,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or else it stood upon the choice of
friends,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O hell! to choose love by another&#8217;s
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<br>
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<br>
Making it momentary as a sound,<br>
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;<br>
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,<br>
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<br>
And ere a man hath power to say &#8216;Behold!&#8217;<br>
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:<br>
So quick bright things come to confusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">If then true lovers have been ever
cross&#8217;d,<br>
It stands as an edict in destiny:<br>
Then let us teach our trial patience,<br>
Because it is a customary cross,<br>
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<br>
Wishes and tears, poor fancy&#8217;s followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">A good persuasion: therefore, hear me,
Hermia.<br>
I have a widow aunt, a dowager<br>
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:<br>
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;<br>
And she respects me as her only son.<br>
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;<br>
And to that place the sharp Athenian law<br>
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,<br>
Steal forth thy father&#8217;s house to-morrow night;<br>
And in the wood, a league without the town,<br>
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,<br>
To do observance to a morn of May,<br>
There will I stay for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">My good Lysander!<br>
I swear to thee, by Cupid&#8217;s strongest bow,<br>
By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>
By the simplicity of Venus&#8217; doves,<br>
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br>
And by that fire which burn&#8217;d the Carthage queen,<br>
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,<br>
By all the vows that ever men have broke,<br>
In number more than ever women spoke,<br>
In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br>
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Helena</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">God speed fair Helena! whither away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.<br>
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!<br>
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue&#8217;s sweet air<br>
More tuneable than lark to shepherd&#8217;s ear,<br>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br>
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,<br>
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;<br>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br>
My tongue should catch your tongue&#8217;s sweet melody.<br>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>
The rest I&#8217;d give to be to you translated.<br>
O, teach me how you look, and with what art<br>
You sway the motion of Demetrius&#8217; heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O that your frowns would teach my smiles such
skill!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O that my prayers could such affection move!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">The more I hate, the more he follows me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">The more I love, the more he hateth me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">None, but your beauty: would that fault were
mine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;<br>
Lysander and myself will fly this place.<br>
Before the time I did Lysander see,<br>
Seem&#8217;d Athens as a paradise to me:<br>
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,<br>
That he hath turn&#8217;d a heaven unto a hell!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:<br>
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br>
Her silver visage in the watery glass,<br>
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,<br>
A time that lovers&#8217; flights doth still conceal,<br>
Through Athens&#8217; gates have we devised to steal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">And in the wood, where often you and I<br>
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,<br>
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;<br>
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,<br>
To seek new friends and stranger companies.<br>
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;<br>
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!<br>
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight<br>
From lovers&#8217; food till morrow deep midnight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my Hermia.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hermia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Helena, adieu:<br>
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">How happy some o&#8217;er other some can be!<br>
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<br>
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<br>
He will not know what all but he do know:<br>
And as he errs, doting on Hermia&#8217;s eyes,<br>
So I, admiring of his qualities:<br>
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,<br>
Love can transpose to form and dignity:<br>
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<br>
And therefore is wing&#8217;d Cupid painted blind:<br>
Nor hath Love&#8217;s mind of any judgement taste;<br>
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:<br>
And therefore is Love said to be a child,<br>
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<br>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br>
So the boy Love is perjured every where:<br>
For ere Demetrius look&#8217;d on Hermia&#8217;s eyne,<br>
He hail&#8217;d down oaths that he was only mine;<br>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br>
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.<br>
I will go tell him of fair Hermia&#8217;s flight:<br>
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night<br>
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<br>
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:<br>
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br>
To have his sight thither and back again.</p>

"Act I Scene II. Athens. Quince&#8217;s house.">
<h4>Scene II. Athens. Quince&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom,
Flute, Snout, and Starveling</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Is all our company here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">You were best to call them generally, man by
man,
according to the scrip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Here is the scroll of every man&#8217;s name,
which is
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
wedding-day at night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">First, good Peter Quince, say what the play
treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy,
and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">A very good piece of work, I assure you, and
a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the
weaver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">A lover, that kills himself most gallant for
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">That will ask some tears in the true performing
of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.</p>
<p class="speech">
The raging rocks<br>
And shivering shocks<br>
Shall break the locks<br>
Of prison gates;<br>
And Phibbus&#8217; car<br>
Shall shine from far<br>
And make and mar<br>
The foolish Fates.</p>
<p class="speech">
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles&#8217; vein, a tyrant&#8217;s vein; a lover is
more condoling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">What is Thisby? a wandering knight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a
beard coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s all one: you shall play it in a
mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too,
I&#8217;ll
speak in a monstrous little voice. &#8216;Thisne,
Thisne;&#8217; &#8216;Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you
Thisby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Well, proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Robin Starveling, the tailor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Starveling</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby&#8217;s
mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You, Pyramus&#8217; father: myself,
Thisby&#8217;s father:
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion&#8217;s part: and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snug</p>
<p class="speech">Have you the lion&#8217;s part written? pray you,
if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
roaring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I
will
do any man&#8217;s heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say &#8216;Let him roar again,
let him roar again.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">An you should do it too terribly, you would
fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
and that were enough to hang us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">That would hang us, every mother&#8217;s son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">I grant you, friends, if that you should fright
the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an &#8217;twere any
nightingale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is
a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
summer&#8217;s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I
best
to play it in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">I will discharge it in either your
straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Some of your French crowns have no hair at all,
and
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
wants. I pray you, fail me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">At the duke&#8217;s oak we meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
