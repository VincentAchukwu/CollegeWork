<h4>Scene I. Rome. Before the Capitol.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Tomb of the Andronici
appearing; the Tribunes and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one
side, Saturninus and his Followers; and, from the other side,
Bassianus and his Followers; with drum and colours</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Noble patricians, patrons of my right,<br>
Defend the justice of my cause with arms,<br>
And, countrymen, my loving followers,<br>
Plead my successive title with your swords:<br>
I am his first-born son, that was the last<br>
That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;<br>
Then let my father&#8217;s honours live in me,<br>
Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my
right,<br>
If ever Bassianus, Caesar&#8217;s son,<br>
Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,<br>
Keep then this passage to the Capitol<br>
And suffer not dishonour to approach<br>
The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,<br>
To justice, continence and nobility;<br>
But let desert in pure election shine,<br>
And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Marcus Andronicus,
aloft, with the crown</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Princes, that strive by factions and by
friends<br>
Ambitiously for rule and empery,<br>
Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand<br>
A special party, have, by common voice,<br>
In election for the Roman empery,<br>
Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius<br>
For many good and great deserts to Rome:<br>
A nobler man, a braver warrior,<br>
Lives not this day within the city walls:<br>
He by the senate is accit&#8217;d home<br>
From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;<br>
That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,<br>
Hath yoked a nation strong, train&#8217;d up in arms.<br>
Ten years are spent since first he undertook<br>
This cause of Rome and chastised with arms<br>
Our enemies&#8217; pride: five times he hath return&#8217;d<br>
Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons<br>
In coffins from the field;<br>
And now at last, laden with horror&#8217;s spoils,<br>
Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,<br>
Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.<br>
Let us entreat, by honour of his name,<br>
Whom worthily you would have now succeed.<br>
And in the Capitol and senate&#8217;s right,<br>
Whom you pretend to honour and adore,<br>
That you withdraw you and abate your strength;<br>
Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,<br>
Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">How fair the tribune speaks to calm my
thoughts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally<br>
In thy uprightness and integrity,<br>
And so I love and honour thee and thine,<br>
Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,<br>
And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,<br>
Gracious Lavinia, Rome&#8217;s rich ornament,<br>
That I will here dismiss my loving friends,<br>
And to my fortunes and the people&#8217;s favor<br>
Commit my cause in balance to be weigh&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt the followers of
Bassianus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Friends, that have been thus forward in my
right,<br>
I thank you all and here dismiss you all,<br>
And to the love and favor of my country<br>
Commit myself, my person and the cause.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt the followers of
Saturninus</span></p>
<p class="speech">Rome, be as just and gracious unto me<br>
As I am confident and kind to thee.<br>
Open the gates, and let me in.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Saturninus and
Bassianus go up into the Capitol</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Captain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.<br>
Patron of virtue, Rome&#8217;s best champion,<br>
Successful in the battles that he fights,<br>
With honour and with fortune is return&#8217;d<br>
From where he circumscribed with his sword,<br>
And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drums and trumpets sounded.
Enter Martius and Mutius; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
covered with black; then Lucius and Quintus. After them, Titus
Andronicus; and then Tamora, with Alarbus, Demetrius, Chiron,
Aaron, and other Goths, prisoners; Soldiers and people following.
The Bearers set down the coffin, and Titus speaks</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!<br>
Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,<br>
Returns with precious jading to the bay<br>
From whence at first she weigh&#8217;d her anchorage,<br>
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,<br>
To re-salute his country with his tears,<br>
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.<br>
Thou great defender of this Capitol,<br>
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!<br>
Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,<br>
Half of the number that King Priam had,<br>
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!<br>
These that survive let Rome reward with love;<br>
These that I bring unto their latest home,<br>
With burial amongst their ancestors:<br>
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.<br>
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,<br>
Why suffer&#8217;st thou thy sons, unburied yet,<br>
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?<br>
Make way to lay them by their brethren.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The tomb is opened</span></p>
<p class="speech">There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,<br>
And sleep in peace, slain in your country&#8217;s wars!<br>
O sacred receptacle of my joys,<br>
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,<br>
How many sons of mine hast thou in store,<br>
That thou wilt never render to me more!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,<br>
That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile<br>
Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,<br>
Before this earthy prison of their bones;<br>
That so the shadows be not unappeased,<br>
Nor we disturb&#8217;d with prodigies on earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">I give him you, the noblest that survives,<br>
The eldest son of this distressed queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,<br>
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,<br>
A mother&#8217;s tears in passion for her son:<br>
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,<br>
O, think my son to be as dear to me!<br>
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,<br>
To beautify thy triumphs and return,<br>
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,<br>
But must my sons be slaughter&#8217;d in the streets,<br>
For valiant doings in their country&#8217;s cause?<br>
O, if to fight for king and commonweal<br>
Were piety in thine, it is in these.<br>
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:<br>
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?<br>
Draw near them then in being merciful:<br>
Sweet mercy is nobility&#8217;s true badge:<br>
Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.<br>
These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld<br>
Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain<br>
Religiously they ask a sacrifice:<br>
To this your son is mark&#8217;d, and die he must,<br>
To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Away with him! and make a fire straight;<br>
And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,<br>
Let&#8217;s hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucius, Quintus,
Martius, and Mutius, with Alarbus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">O cruel, irreligious piety!</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.<br>
Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive<br>
To tremble under Titus&#8217; threatening looks.<br>
Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal<br>
The self-same gods that arm&#8217;d the Queen of Troy<br>
With opportunity of sharp revenge<br>
Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,<br>
May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths&#8212;<br>
When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen&#8212;<br>
To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Lucius, Quintus,
Martius and Mutius, with their swords bloody</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">See, lord and father, how we have
perform&#8217;d<br>
Our Roman rites: Alarbus&#8217; limbs are lopp&#8217;d,<br>
And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,<br>
Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.<br>
Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,<br>
And with loud &#8217;larums welcome them to Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so; and let Andronicus<br>
Make this his latest farewell to their souls.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Trumpets sounded, and the
coffin laid in the tomb</span></p>
<p class="speech">In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;<br>
Rome&#8217;s readiest champions, repose you here in rest,<br>
Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!<br>
Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,<br>
Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,<br>
No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:<br>
In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;<br>
My noble lord and father, live in fame!<br>
Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears<br>
I render, for my brethren&#8217;s obsequies;<br>
And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,<br>
Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:<br>
O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,<br>
Whose fortunes Rome&#8217;s best citizens applaud!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved<br>
The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!<br>
Lavinia, live; outlive thy father&#8217;s days,<br>
And fame&#8217;s eternal date, for virtue&#8217;s praise!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, below, Marcus
Andronicus and Tribunes; re-enter Saturninus and Bassianus,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,<br>
Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,<br>
You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!<br>
Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,<br>
That in your country&#8217;s service drew your swords:<br>
But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,<br>
That hath aspired to Solon&#8217;s happiness<br>
And triumphs over chance in honour&#8217;s bed.<br>
Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,<br>
Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,<br>
Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,<br>
This palliament of white and spotless hue;<br>
And name thee in election for the empire,<br>
With these our late-deceased emperor&#8217;s sons:<br>
Be candidatus then, and put it on,<br>
And help to set a head on headless Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">A better head her glorious body fits<br>
Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:<br>
What should I don this robe, and trouble you?<br>
Be chosen with proclamations to-day,<br>
To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,<br>
And set abroad new business for you all?<br>
Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,<br>
And led my country&#8217;s strength successfully,<br>
And buried one and twenty valiant sons,<br>
Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,<br>
In right and service of their noble country<br>
Give me a staff of honour for mine age,<br>
But not a sceptre to control the world:<br>
Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, Prince Saturninus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Romans, do me right:<br>
Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not<br>
Till Saturninus be Rome&#8217;s emperor.<br>
Andronicus, would thou wert shipp&#8217;d to hell,<br>
Rather than rob me of the people&#8217;s hearts!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good<br>
That noble-minded Titus means to thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee<br>
The people&#8217;s hearts, and wean them from themselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,<br>
But honour thee, and will do till I die:<br>
My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,<br>
I will most thankful be; and thanks to men<br>
Of noble minds is honourable meed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">People of Rome, and people&#8217;s tribunes
here,<br>
I ask your voices and your suffrages:<br>
Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tribunes</p>
<p class="speech">To gratify the good Andronicus,<br>
And gratulate his safe return to Rome,<br>
The people will accept whom he admits.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,<br>
That you create your emperor&#8217;s eldest son,<br>
Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,<br>
Reflect on Rome as Titan&#8217;s rays on earth,<br>
And ripen justice in this commonweal:<br>
Then, if you will elect by my advice,<br>
Crown him and say &#8216;Long live our emperor!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">With voices and applause of every sort,<br>
Patricians and plebeians, we create<br>
Lord Saturninus Rome&#8217;s great emperor,<br>
And say &#8216;Long live our Emperor Saturnine!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A long flourish till they
come down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done<br>
To us in our election this day,<br>
I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,<br>
And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:<br>
And, for an onset, Titus, to advance<br>
Thy name and honourable family,<br>
Lavinia will I make my empress,<br>
Rome&#8217;s royal mistress, mistress of my heart,<br>
And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:<br>
Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match<br>
I hold me highly honour&#8217;d of your grace:<br>
And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,<br>
King and commander of our commonweal,<br>
The wide world&#8217;s emperor, do I consecrate<br>
My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;<br>
Presents well worthy Rome&#8217;s imperial lord:<br>
Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,<br>
Mine honour&#8217;s ensigns humbled at thy feet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!<br>
How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts<br>
Rome shall record, and when I do forget<br>
The least of these unspeakable deserts,<br>
Romans, forget your fealty to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Tamora]</span> Now,
madam, are you prisoner to
an emperor;<br>
To him that, for your honour and your state,<br>
Will use you nobly and your followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Saturninus</p>
<p class="speech">A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue<br>
That I would choose, were I to choose anew.<br>
Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:<br>
Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,<br>
Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:<br>
Princely shall be thy usage every way.<br>
Rest on my word, and let not discontent<br>
Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you<br>
Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.<br>
Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">Not I, my lord; sith true nobility<br>
Warrants these words in princely courtesy.</p>

Answer I must and shall do with my life.<br>
Only thus much I give your grace to know:<br>
By all the duties that I owe to Rome,<br>
This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,<br>
Is in opinion and in honour wrong&#8217;d;<br>
That in the rescue of Lavinia<br>
With his own hand did slay his youngest son,<br>
In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath<br>
To be controll&#8217;d in that he frankly gave:<br>
Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,<br>

I should be author to dishonour you!<br>
But on mine honour dare I undertake<br>
For good Lord Titus&#8217; innocence in all;<br>
Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:<br>
Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;<br>

Upon a just survey, take Titus&#8217; part,<br>
And so supplant you for ingratitude,<br>
Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,<br>
Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:<br>

I would not part a bachelor from the priest.<br>

What, is Lavinia then become so loose,<br>

Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste<br>

A speedier course than lingering languishment<br>

My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;<br>
There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:<br>
The forest walks are wide and spacious;<br>
And many unfrequented plots there are<br>
Fitted by kind for rape and villany:<br>
Single you thither then this dainty doe,<br>
And strike her home by force, if not by words:<br>
This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.<br>
Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit<br>
To villany and vengeance consecrate,<br>
Will we acquaint with all that we intend;<br>
And she shall file our engines with advice,<br>
That will not suffer you to square yourselves,<br>
But to your wishes&#8217; height advance you both.<br>
The emperor&#8217;s court is like the house of Fame,<br>
The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:<br>
The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;<br>
There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
your turns;<br>
There serve your lusts, shadow&#8217;d from heaven&#8217;s eye,<br>

To bury so much gold under a tree,<br>
And never after to inherit it.<br>
Let him that thinks of me so abjectly<br>

sad,<br>
When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?<br>
The birds chant melody on every bush,<br>
The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,<br>
The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind<br>
And make a chequer&#8217;d shadow on the ground:<br>
Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,<br>
And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,<br>
Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,<br>
As if a double hunt were heard at once,<br>
Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;<br>
And, after conflict such as was supposed<br>
The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy&#8217;d,<br>
When with a happy storm they were surprised<br>
And curtain&#8217;d with a counsel-keeping cave,<br>
We may, each wreathed in the other&#8217;s arms,<br>
Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;<br>
Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds<br>
Be unto us as is a nurse&#8217;s song<br>
Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.</p>

<p class="speech">Madam, though Venus govern your desires,<br>
Saturn is dominator over mine:<br>
What signifies my deadly-standing eye,<br>
My silence and my cloudy melancholy,<br>
My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls<br>
Even as an adder when she doth unroll<br>
To do some fatal execution?<br>
No, madam, these are no venereal signs:<br>
Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,<br>
Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.<br>
Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,<br>
Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,<br>
This is the day of doom for Bassianus:<br>
His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,<br>
Thy sons make pillage of her chastity<br>
And wash their hands in Bassianus&#8217; blood.<br>
Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,<br>
And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.<br>

Who hath abandoned her holy groves<br>
To see the general hunting in this forest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Saucy controller of our private steps!<br>
Had I the power that some say Dian had,<br>
Thy temples should be planted presently<br>
With horns, as was Actaeon&#8217;s; and the hounds<br>
Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,<br>
Unmannerly intruder as thou art!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>

&#8217;Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;<br>
And to be doubted that your Moor and you<br>

Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!<br>
&#8217;Tis pity they should take him for a stag.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassianus</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian<br>
Doth make your honour of his body&#8217;s hue,<br>
Spotted, detested, and abominable.<br>
Why are you sequester&#8217;d from all your train,<br>
Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.<br>
And wander&#8217;d hither to an obscure plot,<br>
Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,<br>
If foul desire had not conducted you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">And, being intercepted in your sport,<br>
Great reason that my noble lord be rated<br>
For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,<br>

mother!<br>
Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?<br>
These two have &#8217;ticed me hither to this place:<br>
A barren detested vale, you see it is;<br>
The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,<br>
O&#8217;ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:<br>
Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,<br>
Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:<br>
And when they show&#8217;d me this abhorred pit,<br>
They told me, here, at dead time of the night,<br>
A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,<br>
Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,<br>
Would make such fearful and confused cries<br>
As any mortal body hearing it<br>
Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.<br>
No sooner had they told this hellish tale,<br>
But straight they told me they would bind me here<br>
Unto the body of a dismal yew,<br>
And leave me to this miserable death:<br>
And then they call&#8217;d me foul adulteress,<br>
Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms<br>
That ever ear did hear to such effect:<br>
And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,<br>
This vengeance on me had they executed.<br>
Revenge it, as you love your mother&#8217;s life,<br>
Or be ye not henceforth call&#8217;d my children.</p>

Your mother&#8217;s hand shall right your mother&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;<br>
First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:<br>
This minion stood upon her chastity,<br>
Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,<br>
And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:<br>
And shall she carry this unto her grave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.<br>
Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,<br>
And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">But when ye have the honey ye desire,<br>
Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>

Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy<br>
That nice-preserved honesty of yours.</p>

<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory<br>
To see her tears; but be your heart to them<br>
As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">When did the tiger&#8217;s young ones teach the
dam?<br>
O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;<br>
The milk thou suck&#8217;dst from her did turn to marble;<br>
Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.<br>
Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Chiron</span></p>
<p class="speech">Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chiron</p>
<p class="speech">What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a

<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a
lark:<br>
Yet have I heard,&#8212;O, could I find it now!&#8212;<br>
The lion moved with pity did endure<br>
To have his princely paws pared all away:<br>
Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,<br>
The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:<br>
O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,<br>
Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what it means; away with her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me teach thee! for my father&#8217;s
sake,<br>
That gave thee life, when well he might have
slain thee,<br>
Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tamora</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou in person ne&#8217;er offended me,<br>
Even for his sake am I pitiless.<br>
Remember, boys, I pour&#8217;d forth tears in vain,<br>
To save your brother from the sacrifice;<br>
But fierce Andronicus would not relent;<br>
Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,<br>
The worse to her, the better loved of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lavinia</p>
<p class="speech">O Tamora, be call&#8217;d a gentle queen,<br>

That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!<br>
Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp&#8217;d,<br>
Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.<br>
Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,<br>
And in a tedious sampler sew&#8217;d her mind:<br>
But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;<br>
A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,<br>
And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,<br>
That could have better sew&#8217;d than Philomel.<br>
O, had the monster seen those lily hands<br>
Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,<br>
And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,<br>
He would not then have touch&#8217;d them for his life!<br>
Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony<br>
Which that sweet tongue hath made,<br>
He would have dropp&#8217;d his knife, and fell asleep<br>
As Cerberus at the Thracian poet&#8217;s feet.<br>
Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;<br>
For such a sight will blind a father&#8217;s eye:<br>
One hour&#8217;s storm will drown the fragrant meads;<br>
What will whole months of tears thy father&#8217;s eyes?<br>
Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee<br>
O, could our mourning ease thy misery!</p>

<h4>Scene I. Rome. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Judges, Senators and
Tribunes, with Martius and Quintus, bound, passing on to the place
of execution; Titus going before, pleading</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!<br>
For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent<br>
In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;<br>
For all my blood in Rome&#8217;s great quarrel shed;<br>
For all the frosty nights that I have watch&#8217;d;<br>
And for these bitter tears, which now you see<br>
Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;<br>
Be pitiful to my condemned sons,<br>
Whose souls are not corrupted as &#8217;tis thought.<br>
For two and twenty sons I never wept,<br>
Because they died in honour&#8217;s lofty bed.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lieth down; the Judges, &amp;
c., pass by him, and Exeunt</span></p>
<p class="speech">For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I
write<br>
My heart&#8217;s deep languor and my soul&#8217;s sad tears:<br>
Let my tears stanch the earth&#8217;s dry appetite;<br>
My sons&#8217; sweet blood will make it shame and blush.<br>
O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,<br>
That shall distil from these two ancient urns,<br>
Than youthful April shall with all his showers:<br>
In summer&#8217;s drought I&#8217;ll drop upon thee still;<br>
In winter with warm tears I&#8217;ll melt the snow<br>
And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,<br>
So thou refuse to drink my dear sons&#8217; blood.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lucius, with his sword
drawn</span></p>
<p class="speech">O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!<br>
Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;<br>
And let me say, that never wept before,<br>
My tears are now prevailing orators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O noble father, you lament in vain:<br>
The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;<br>
And you recount your sorrows to a stone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.<br>
Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,<br>
They would not mark me, or if they did mark,<br>
They would not pity me, yet plead I must;<br>
Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;<br>
Who, though they cannot answer my distress,<br>
Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,<br>
For that they will not intercept my tale:<br>
When I do weep, they humbly at my feet<br>
Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;<br>
And, were they but attired in grave weeds,<br>
Rome could afford no tribune like to these.<br>
A stone is soft as wax,&#8212;tribunes more hard than stones;<br>
A stone is silent, and offendeth not,<br>
And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Rises</span></p>
<p class="speech">But wherefore stand&#8217;st thou with thy weapon
drawn?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">To rescue my two brothers from their death:<br>
For which attempt the judges have pronounced<br>
My everlasting doom of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O happy man! they have befriended thee.<br>
Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive<br>
That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?<br>
Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey<br>
But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,<br>
From these devourers to be banished!<br>
But who comes with our brother Marcus here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Marcus and
Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;<br>
Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:<br>
I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Will it consume me? let me see it, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">This was thy daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Marcus, so she is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me, this object kills me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.<br>
Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand<br>
Hath made thee handless in thy father&#8217;s sight?<br>
What fool hath added water to the sea,<br>
Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?<br>
My grief was at the height before thou camest,<br>
And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.<br>
Give me a sword, I&#8217;ll chop off my hands too;<br>
For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;<br>
And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;<br>
In bootless prayer have they been held up,<br>
And they have served me to effectless use:<br>
Now all the service I require of them<br>
Is that the one will help to cut the other.<br>
&#8217;Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;<br>
For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr&#8217;d
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, that delightful engine of her thoughts<br>
That blabb&#8217;d them with such pleasing eloquence,<br>
Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,<br>
Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung<br>
Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, thus I found her, straying in the park,<br>
Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer<br>
That hath received some unrecuring wound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">It was my deer; and he that wounded her<br>
Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:<br>
For now I stand as one upon a rock<br>
Environed with a wilderness of sea,<br>
Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,<br>
Expecting ever when some envious surge<br>
Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.<br>
This way to death my wretched sons are gone;<br>
Here stands my other son, a banished man,<br>
And here my brother, weeping at my woes.<br>
But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,<br>
Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.<br>
Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,<br>
It would have madded me: what shall I do<br>
Now I behold thy lively body so?<br>
Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:<br>
Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr&#8217;d thee:<br>
Thy husband he is dead: and for his death<br>
Thy brothers are condemn&#8217;d, and dead by this.<br>
Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!<br>
When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears<br>
Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew<br>
Upon a gather&#8217;d lily almost wither&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance she weeps because they kill&#8217;d her
husband;<br>
Perchance because she knows them innocent.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful<br>
Because the law hath ta&#8217;en revenge on them.<br>
No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;<br>
Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.<br>
Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.<br>
Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:<br>
Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,<br>
And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,<br>
Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks<br>
How they are stain&#8217;d, as meadows, yet not dry,<br>
With miry slime left on them by a flood?<br>
And in the fountain shall we gaze so long<br>
Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,<br>
And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?<br>
Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?<br>
Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows<br>
Pass the remainder of our hateful days?<br>
What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,<br>
Plot some deuce of further misery,<br>
To make us wonder&#8217;d at in time to come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your
grief,<br>
See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot<br>
Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,<br>
For thou, poor man, hast drown&#8217;d it with thine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:<br>
Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say<br>
That to her brother which I said to thee:<br>
His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,<br>
Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.<br>
O, what a sympathy of woe is this,<br>
As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor<br>
Sends thee this word,&#8212;that, if thou love thy sons,<br>
Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,<br>
Or any one of you, chop off your hand,<br>
And send it to the king: he for the same<br>
Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;<br>
And that shall be the ransom for their fault.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!<br>
Did ever raven sing so like a lark,<br>
That gives sweet tidings of the sun&#8217;s uprise?<br>
With all my heart, I&#8217;ll send the emperor My hand:<br>
Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,<br>
That hath thrown down so many enemies,<br>
Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:<br>
My youth can better spare my blood than you;<br>
And therefore mine shall save my brothers&#8217; lives.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Which of your hands hath not
defended Rome,<br>
And rear&#8217;d aloft the bloody battle-axe,<br>
Writing destruction on the enemy&#8217;s castle?<br>
O, none of both but are of high desert:<br>
My hand hath been but idle; let it serve<br>
To ransom my two nephews from their death;<br>
Then have I kept it to a worthy end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,<br>
For fear they die before their pardon come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">My hand shall go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;By heaven, it shall not go!</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Sirs, strive no more: such wither&#8217;d herbs
as these<br>
Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,<br>
Let me redeem my brothers both from death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">And, for our father&#8217;s sake and
mother&#8217;s care,<br>
Now let me show a brother&#8217;s love to thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Agree between you; I will spare my hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Then I&#8217;ll go fetch an axe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But I will use the axe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lucius and
Marcus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, Aaron; I&#8217;ll deceive them
both:<br>
Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If that be
call&#8217;d deceit, I will be honest,<br>
And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:<br>

<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now stay your strife: what shall be is
dispatch&#8217;d.<br>
Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:<br>
Tell him it was a hand that warded him<br>
From thousand dangers; bid him bury it<br>
More hath it merited; that let it have.<br>
As for my sons, say I account of them<br>
As jewels purchased at an easy price;<br>
And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand<br>
Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany<br>
Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!<br>
Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.<br>
Aaron will have his soul black like his face.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,<br>
And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:<br>
If any power pities wretched tears,<br>
To that I call!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Lavinia</span></p>
<p class="speech">What, wilt thou kneel with me?<br>
Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;<br>
Or with our sighs we&#8217;ll breathe the welkin dim,<br>
And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds<br>
When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O brother, speak with possibilities,<br>
And do not break into these deep extremes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?<br>
Then be my passions bottomless with them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But yet let reason govern thy lament.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">If there were reason for these miseries,<br>
Then into limits could I bind my woes:<br>
When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o&#8217;erflow?<br>
If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,<br>
Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?<br>
And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?<br>
I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!<br>
She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:<br>
Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;<br>
Then must my earth with her continual tears<br>
Become a deluge, overflow&#8217;d and drown&#8217;d;<br>
For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,<br>
But like a drunkard must I vomit them.<br>
Then give me leave, for losers will have leave<br>
To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger, with two

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid<br>
For that good hand thou sent&#8217;st the emperor.<br>
Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;<br>
And here&#8217;s thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;<br>
Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock&#8217;d;<br>
That woe is me to think upon thy woes<br>
More than remembrance of my father&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now let hot Aetna cool in Sicily,<br>
And be my heart an ever-burning hell!<br>
These miseries are more than may be borne.<br>
To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;<br>
But sorrow flouted at is double death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, that this sight should make so deep a
wound,<br>
And yet detested life not shrink thereat!<br>
That ever death should let life bear his name,<br>
Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lavinia kisses

<p class="speech">When will this fearful slumber have an end?</p>

<p class="speech">Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;<br>
Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons&#8217; heads,<br>
Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:<br>
Thy other banish&#8217;d son, with this dear sight<br>
Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,<br>
Even like a stony image, cold and numb.<br>
Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:<br>
Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand<br>
Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight<br>
The closing up of our most wretched eyes;<br>
Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this
hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I have not another tear to shed:<br>
Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,<br>
And would usurp upon my watery eyes<br>
And make them blind with tributary tears:<br>
Then which way shall I find Revenge&#8217;s cave?<br>
For these two heads do seem to speak to me,<br>
And threat me I shall never come to bliss<br>
Till all these mischiefs be return&#8217;d again<br>
Even in their throats that have committed them.<br>
Come, let me see what task I have to do.<br>
You heavy people, circle me about,<br>
That I may turn me to each one of you,<br>
And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.<br>
The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;<br>
And in this hand the other I will bear.<br>
Lavinia, thou shalt be employ&#8217;d: these arms!<br>
Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.<br>
As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;<br>
Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:<br>
Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:<br>
And, if you love me, as I think you do,<br>
Let&#8217;s kiss and part, for we have much to do.</p>

Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,<br>
He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:<br>
Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;<br>
O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!<br>
But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives<br>
But in oblivion and hateful griefs.<br>
If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;<br>
And make proud Saturnine and his empress<br>

Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:<br>
Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,<br>

With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine<br>

Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.<br>
What violent hands can she lay on her life?<br>
Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;<br>
To bid Aeneas tell the tale twice o&#8217;er,<br>
How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?<br>
O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,<br>
Lest we remember still that we have none.<br>
Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,<br>
As if we should forget we had no hands,<br>
If Marcus did not name the word of hands!<br>
Come, let&#8217;s fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:<br>
Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;<br>
I can interpret all her martyr&#8217;d signs;<br>
She says she drinks no other drink but tears,<br>
Brew&#8217;d with her sorrow, mesh&#8217;d upon her cheeks:<br>
Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;<br>
In thy dumb action will I be as perfect<br>
As begging hermits in their holy prayers:<br>
Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,<br>
Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,<br>

<p class="speech">Alas, my lord, I have but kill&#8217;d a fly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">But how, if that fly had a father and mother?<br>
How would he hang his slender gilded wings,<br>
And buzz lamenting doings in the air!<br>
Poor harmless fly,<br>
That, with his pretty buzzing melody,<br>
Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
kill&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor&#8217;d
fly,<br>
Like to the empress&#8217; Moor; therefore I kill&#8217;d him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, O, O,<br>
Then pardon me for reprehending thee,<br>
For thou hast done a charitable deed.<br>
Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;<br>
Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor<br>
Come hither purposely to poison me.&#8212;<br>
There&#8217;s for thyself, and that&#8217;s for Tamora.<br>
Ah, sirrah!<br>
Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,<br>
But that between us we can kill a fly<br>
That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,<br>
He takes false shadows for true substances.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:<br>
I&#8217;ll to thy closet; and go read with thee<br>
Sad stories chanced in the times of old.<br>
Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,<br>
And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.</p>

Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.<br>
Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.</p>

<p class="speech">Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:<br>
See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:<br>
Somewhither would she have thee go with her.<br>
Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care<br>
Read to her sons than she hath read to thee<br>
Sweet poetry and Tully&#8217;s Orator.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee
thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,<br>
Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:<br>
For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,<br>
Extremity of griefs would make men mad;<br>
And I have read that Hecuba of Troy<br>
Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;<br>
Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt<br>
Loves me as dear as e&#8217;er my mother did,<br>
And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:<br>
Which made me down to throw my books, and fly&#8212;<br>
Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:<br>

Some book there is that she desires to see.<br>
Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.<br>
But thou art deeper read, and better skill&#8217;d<br>
Come, and take choice of all my library,<br>
And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens<br>
Reveal the damn&#8217;d contriver of this deed.<br>
Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">I think she means that there was more than
one<br>

Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.</p>

<p class="speech">Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Grandsire, &#8217;tis Ovid&#8217;s

My mother gave it me.</p>

<p class="speech">Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Helping her</span></p>
<p class="speech">What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?<br>
This is the tragic tale of Philomel,<br>
And treats of Tereus&#8217; treason and his rape:<br>
And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">See, brother, see; note how she quotes the
leaves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet
girl,<br>
Ravish&#8217;d and wrong&#8217;d, as Philomela was,<br>
Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!<br>
Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt&#8212;<br>
O, had we never, never hunted there!&#8212;<br>
Pattern&#8217;d by that the poet here describes,<br>
By nature made for murders and for rapes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O, why should nature build so foul a den,<br>
Unless the gods delight in tragedies?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
but friends,<br>
What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:<br>
Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,<br>
That left the camp to sin in Lucrece&#8217; bed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by

Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,<br>

My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:<br>
This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst<br>

<p class="speech">O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know<br>
There is enough written upon this earth<br>
To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts<br>
And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.<br>
My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;<br>
And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector&#8217;s hope;<br>
And swear with me, as, with the woful fere<br>
And father of that chaste dishonour&#8217;d dame,<br>
Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece&#8217; rape,<br>
That we will prosecute by good advice<br>
Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,<br>
And see their blood, or die with this reproach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>

But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:<br>
The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,<br>
She&#8217;s with the lion deeply still in league,<br>
And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,<br>
And when he sleeps will she do what she list.<br>
You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;<br>
And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,<br>
And with a gad of steel will write these words,<br>
And lay it by: the angry northern wind<br>
Will blow these sands, like Sibyl&#8217;s leaves, abroad,<br>
And where&#8217;s your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">I say, my lord, that if I were a man,<br>

For it is you that puts us to our shifts:<br>

<p class="speech">Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.<br>
Sir boy, now let me see your archery;<br>
Look ye draw home enough, and &#8217;tis there straight.<br>
Terras Astraea reliquit:<br>
Be you remember&#8217;d, Marcus, she&#8217;s gone, she&#8217;s
fled.<br>
Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall<br>
Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;<br>
Happily you may catch her in the sea;<br>
Yet there&#8217;s as little justice as at land:<br>
No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;<br>
&#8217;Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,<br>
And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:<br>
Then, when you come to Pluto&#8217;s region,<br>
I pray you, deliver him this petition;<br>
Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,<br>
And that it comes from old Andronicus,<br>
Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.<br>
Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable<br>
What time I threw the people&#8217;s suffrages<br>
On him that thus doth tyrannize o&#8217;er me.<br>
Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,<br>
And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch&#8217;d:<br>
This wicked emperor may have shipp&#8217;d her hence;<br>
And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">O Publius, is not this a heavy case,<br>
To see thy noble uncle thus distract?</p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns<br>
By day and night to attend him carefully,<br>
And feed his humour kindly as we may,<br>
Till time beget some careful remedy.</p>

<p class="speech">Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.<br>
Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war<br>
Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,<br>

<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Publius, how now! how now, my masters!<br>
What, have you met with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,<br>
If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:<br>
Marry, for Justice, she is so employ&#8217;d,<br>
He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,<br>
So that perforce you must needs stay a time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.<br>
I&#8217;ll dive into the burning lake below,<br>
And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.<br>
Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we<br>
No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops&#8217; size;<br>
But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,<br>
Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:<br>
And, sith there&#8217;s no justice in earth nor hell,<br>
We will solicit heaven and move the gods<br>
To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.<br>
Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;</p>

You were as good to shoot against the wind.<br>

Of my word, I have written to effect;<br>
There&#8217;s not a god left unsolicited.</p>

<p class="speech">Ha, ha!<br>
Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?<br>
See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus&#8217; horns.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">This was the sport, my lord: when Publius
shot,<br>
The Bull, being gall&#8217;d, gave Aries such a knock<br>
That down fell both the Ram&#8217;s horns in the court;<br>
And who should find them but the empress&#8217; villain?<br>
She laugh&#8217;d, and told the Moor he should not choose<br>
But give them to his master for a present.</p>

Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?<br>

taken
them down again, for the man must not be hanged till

<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there
God
forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial&#8217;s men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve
for
your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
the emperor from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the
emperor
with a grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all
my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,<br>
But give your pigeons to the emperor:<br>
By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.<br>
Hold, hold; meanwhile here&#8217;s money for thy charges.<br>
Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace
deliver a supplication?</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Then here is a supplication for you. And when
you
come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,
then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
then look for your reward. I&#8217;ll be at hand, sir; see
you do it bravely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant you, sir, let me alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see
it.<br>
Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;<br>
For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.<br>
And when thou hast given it the emperor,<br>
Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clown</p>

An emperor in Rome thus overborne,<br>
Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent<br>

My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,<br>
However these disturbers of our peace<br>
Buz in the people&#8217;s ears, there nought hath pass&#8217;d,<br>

Of old Andronicus. And what an if<br>
His sorrows have so overwhelm&#8217;d his wits,<br>
Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,<br>
His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?<br>
And now he writes to heaven for his redress:<br>
See, here&#8217;s to Jove, and this to Mercury;<br>
This to Apollo; this to the god of war;<br>
Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!<br>
What&#8217;s this but libelling against the senate,<br>
And blazoning our injustice every where?<br>
A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?<br>
As who would say, in Rome no justice were.<br>
But if I live, his feigned ecstasies<br>
Shall be no shelter to these outrages:<br>
But he and his shall know that justice lives<br>
In Saturninus&#8217; health, whom, if she sleep,<br>

Cut off the proud&#8217;st conspirator that lives.</p>

Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus&#8217; age,<br>

Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr&#8217;d his heart;<br>

For these contempts.</p>

These tidings nip me, and I hang the head<br>
As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:<br>
Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:<br>
&#8217;Tis he the common people love so much;<br>
Myself hath often over-heard them say,<br>
When I have walked like a private man,<br>
That Lucius&#8217; banishment was wrongfully,<br>

Is the sun dimm&#8217;d, that gnats do fly in it?<br>
The eagle suffers little birds to sing,<br>
And is not careful what they mean thereby,<br>
Knowing that with the shadow of his wings<br>
He can at pleasure stint their melody:<br>
Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.<br>
Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,<br>
I will enchant the old Andronicus<br>
With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,<br>
Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,<br>
When as the one is wounded with the bait,<br>
The other rotted with delicious feed.</p>

I heard a child cry underneath a wall.<br>
I made unto the noise; when soon I heard<br>
The crying babe controll&#8217;d with this discourse:<br>
&#8216;Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!<br>
Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,<br>
Had nature lent thee but thy mother&#8217;s look,<br>
Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:<br>
But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,<br>
They never do beget a coal-black calf.<br>
Peace, villain, peace!&#8217;&#8212;even thus he rates
the babe,&#8212;<br>
&#8216;For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;<br>
Who, when he knows thou art the empress&#8217; babe,<br>
Will hold thee dearly for thy mother&#8217;s sake.&#8217;<br>
With this, my weapon drawn, I rush&#8217;d upon him,<br>

Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know<br>
An idiot holds his bauble for a god<br>
And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,<br>
To that I&#8217;ll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow<br>
By that same god, what god soe&#8217;er it be,<br>

As true a dog as ever fought at head.<br>
Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.<br>
I train&#8217;d thy brethren to that guileful hole<br>
Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:<br>
I wrote the letter that thy father found<br>
And hid the gold within the letter mention&#8217;d,<br>
Confederate with the queen and her two sons:<br>
And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,<br>
Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?<br>
I play&#8217;d the cheater for thy father&#8217;s hand,<br>
And, when I had it, drew myself apart<br>
And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:<br>
I pry&#8217;d me through the crevice of a wall<br>
When, for his hand, he had his two sons&#8217; heads;<br>
Beheld his tears, and laugh&#8217;d so heartily,<br>
That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :<br>
And when I told the empress of this sport,<br>
She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,<br>
And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.<br>
Even now I curse the day&#8212;and yet, I think,<br>
Few come within the compass of my curse,&#8212;<br>
Wherein I did not some notorious ill,<br>
As kill a man, or else devise his death,<br>
Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,<br>
Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,<br>
Set deadly enmity between two friends,<br>
Make poor men&#8217;s cattle break their necks;<br>
Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,<br>
And bid the owners quench them with their tears.<br>
Oft have I digg&#8217;d up dead men from their graves,<br>
And set them upright at their dear friends&#8217; doors,<br>
Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;<br>
And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,<br>
Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,<br>
&#8216;Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.&#8217;<br>
Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things<br>
As willingly as one would kill a fly,<br>
And nothing grieves me heartily indeed<br>
But that I cannot do ten thousand more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>

So sweet a death as hanging presently.</p>

For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:<br>

She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:<br>

To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,<br>
By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.<br>
Come down, and welcome me to this world&#8217;s light;<br>
Confer with me of murder and of death:<br>
There&#8217;s not a hollow cave or lurking-place,<br>
No vast obscurity or misty vale,<br>
Where bloody murder or detested rape<br>
Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;<br>
And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,<br>
Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.</p>

And then I&#8217;ll come and be thy waggoner,<br>
And whirl along with thee about the globe.<br>
Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,<br>
To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,<br>
And find out murderers in their guilty caves:<br>
And when thy car is loaden with their heads,<br>
I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel<br>
Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,<br>
Even from Hyperion&#8217;s rising in the east<br>
Until his very downfall in the sea:<br>
And day by day I&#8217;ll do this heavy task,<br>

are!<br>
And you, the empress! but we worldly men<br>

Could not all hell afford you such a devil?<br>
For well I wot the empress never wags<br>

Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap<br>
To find another that is like to thee,<br>
Good Rapine, stab him; he&#8217;s a ravisher.<br>
Go thou with them; and in the emperor&#8217;s court<br>
There is a queen, attended by a Moor;<br>
Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,<br>

Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,<br>
And bid him come and banquet at thy house;<br>
When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,<br>
I will bring in the empress and her sons,<br>
The emperor himself and all thy foes;<br>
And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,<br>
And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.<br>

O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!<br>
Here stands the spring whom you have stain&#8217;d with mud,<br>
This goodly summer with your winter mix&#8217;d.<br>
You kill&#8217;d her husband, and for that vile fault<br>
Two of her brothers were condemn&#8217;d to death,<br>
My hand cut off and made a merry jest;<br>
Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear<br>
Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,<br>
Inhuman traitors, you constrain&#8217;d and forced.<br>
What would you say, if I should let you speak?<br>
Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.<br>
Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.<br>
This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,<br>
Whilst that Lavinia &#8217;tween her stumps doth hold<br>
The basin that receives your guilty blood.<br>
You know your mother means to feast with me,<br>
And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:<br>
Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust<br>
And with your blood and it I&#8217;ll make a paste,<br>
And of the paste a coffin I will rear<br>
And make two pasties of your shameful heads,<br>
And bid that strumpet, your unhallow&#8217;d dam,<br>
Like to the earth swallow her own increase.<br>
This is the feast that I have bid her to,<br>
And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;<br>
For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,<br>
And worse than Progne I will be revenged:<br>
And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He cuts their
throats</span></p>
<p class="speech">Receive the blood: and when that they are
dead,<br>
Let me go grind their bones to powder small<br>
And with this hateful liquor temper it;<br>
And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.<br>
Come, come, be every one officious<br>
To make this banquet; which I wish may prove<br>
More stern and bloody than the Centaurs&#8217; feast.<br>
So, now bring them in, for I&#8217;ll play the cook,<br>

Or who hath brought the fatal engine in<br>
That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.<br>

That my report is just and full of truth.<br>
But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,<br>
Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;<br>
For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing to the Child in the
arms of an Attendant</span></p>
<p class="speech">Of this was Tamora delivered;<br>
The issue of an irreligious Moor,<br>
Chief architect and plotter of these woes:<br>
The villain is alive in Titus&#8217; house,<br>
And as he is, to witness this is true.<br>
Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge<br>
These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,<br>
Or more than any living man could bear.<br>
Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?<br>
Have we done aught amiss,&#8212;show us wherein,<br>
And, from the place where you behold us now,<br>
The poor remainder of Andronici<br>
Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.<br>
And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,<br>
And make a mutual closure of our house.<br>
Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,<br>
Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aemilius</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,<br>
And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,<br>
Lucius our emperor; for well I know<br>
The common voice do cry it shall be so.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Lucius, all hail, Rome&#8217;s royal emperor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, go into old Titus&#8217; sorrowful house,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech">And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,<br>
To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,<br>
As punishment for his most wicked life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Lucius, Marcus, and the
others descend</span></p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Lucius, all hail, Rome&#8217;s gracious
governor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,<br>
To heal Rome&#8217;s harms, and wipe away her woe!<br>
But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,<br>
For nature puts me to a heavy task:<br>
Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,<br>
To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.<br>
O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kissing Titus</span></p>
<p class="speech">These sorrowful drops upon thy
blood-stain&#8217;d face,<br>
The last true duties of thy noble son!</p>
<p class="speaker">Marcus Andronicus</p>
<p class="speech">Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,<br>
Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:<br>
O were the sum of these that I should pay<br>
Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us<br>
To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:<br>
Many a time he danced thee on his knee,<br>
Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:<br>
Many a matter hath he told to thee,<br>
Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;<br>
In that respect, then, like a loving child,<br>
Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,<br>
Because kind nature doth require it so:<br>
Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:<br>
Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;<br>
Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Young Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my
heart<br>
Would I were dead, so you did live again!<br>
O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;<br>
My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendants with
Aaron</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Aemilius</p>
<p class="speech">You sad Andronici, have done with woes:<br>
Give sentence on this execrable wretch,<br>
That hath been breeder of these dire events.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;<br>
There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;<br>
If any one relieves or pities him,<br>
For the offence he dies. This is our doom:<br>
Some stay to see him fasten&#8217;d in the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Aaron</p>
<p class="speech">O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?<br>
I am no baby, I, that with base prayers<br>
I should repent the evils I have done:<br>
Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did<br>
Would I perform, if I might have my will;<br>
If one good deed in all my life I did,<br>
I do repent it from my very soul.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucius</p>
<p class="speech">Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,<br>
And give him burial in his father&#8217;s grave:<br>
My father and Lavinia shall forthwith<br>
Be closed in our household&#8217;s monument.<br>
As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,<br>
No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,<br>
No mournful bell shall ring her burial;<br>
But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:<br>
Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;<br>
And, being so, shall have like want of pity.<br>
See justice done on Aaron, that damn&#8217;d Moor,<br>
By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:<br>
Then, afterwards, to order well the state,<br>
That like events may ne&#8217;er it ruinate.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
