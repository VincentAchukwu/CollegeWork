<h4>Scene I. A public place.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Mercutio, Benvolio,
Page, and Servants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, good Mercutio, let&#8217;s
retire:<br>
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,<br>
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;<br>
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art like one of those fellows that when
he
enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
upon the table and says &#8216;God send me no need of
thee!&#8217; and by the operation of the second cup draws
it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Am I like such a fellow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood
as
any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
soon moody to be moved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">And what to?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, an there were two such, we should have
none
shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any
man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">The fee-simple! O simple!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">By my head, here come the Capulets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">By my heel, I care not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Tybalt and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Follow me close, for I will speak to them.<br>
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">And but one word with one of us? couple it
with
something; make it a word and a blow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an
you
will give me occasion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Could you not take some occasion without
giving?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Mercutio, thou consort&#8217;st with
Romeo,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels?
an
thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
discords: here&#8217;s my fiddlestick; here&#8217;s that shall
make you dance. &#8217;Zounds, consort!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">We talk here in the public haunt of men:<br>
Either withdraw unto some private place,<br>
And reason coldly of your grievances,<br>
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Men&#8217;s eyes were made to look, and let them
gaze;<br>
I will not budge for no man&#8217;s pleasure, I.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my
man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">But I&#8217;ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your
livery:<br>
Marry, go before to field, he&#8217;ll be your follower;<br>
Your worship in that sense may call him &#8216;man.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford<br>
No better term than this,&#8212;thou art a villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee<br>
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage<br>
To such a greeting: villain am I none;<br>
Therefore farewell; I see thou know&#8217;st me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries<br>
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I do protest, I never injured thee,<br>
But love thee better than thou canst devise,<br>
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:<br>
And so, good Capulet,&#8212;which name I tender<br>
As dearly as my own,&#8212;be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!<br>
Alla stoccata carries it away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Draws</span></p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">What wouldst thou have with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Good king of cats, nothing but one of your
nine
lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
ears ere it be out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">I am for you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drawing</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Come, sir, your passado.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.<br>
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!<br>
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath<br>
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:<br>
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Tybalt under Romeo&#8217;s
arm stabs Mercutio, and flies with his followers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">I am hurt.<br>
A plague o&#8217; both your houses! I am sped.<br>
Is he gone, and hath nothing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">What, art thou hurt?</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, &#8217;tis
enough.<br>
Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Page</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">No, &#8217;tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide
as a
church-door; but &#8217;tis enough,&#8217;twill serve: ask for
me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o&#8217;
both your houses! &#8217;Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
was hurt under your arm.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">I thought all for the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">Mercutio</p>
<p class="speech">Help me into some house, Benvolio,<br>
Or I shall faint. A plague o&#8217; both your houses!<br>
They have made worms&#8217; meat of me: I have it,<br>
And soundly too: your houses!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Mercutio and
Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">This gentleman, the prince&#8217;s near ally,<br>
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt<br>
In my behalf; my reputation stain&#8217;d<br>
With Tybalt&#8217;s slander,&#8212;Tybalt, that an hour<br>
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,<br>
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate<br>
And in my temper soften&#8217;d valour&#8217;s steel!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Benvolio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio&#8217;s dead!<br>
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,<br>
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">This day&#8217;s black fate on more days doth
depend;<br>
This but begins the woe, others must end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!<br>
Away to heaven, respective lenity,<br>
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Tybalt</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,<br>
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio&#8217;s soul<br>
Is but a little way above our heads,<br>
Staying for thine to keep him company:<br>
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tybalt</p>
<p class="speech">Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him
here,<br>
Shalt with him hence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">This shall determine that.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They fight; Tybalt
falls</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo, away, be gone!<br>
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.<br>
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,<br>
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, I am fortune&#8217;s fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou stay?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Citizens, &amp;
c</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Which way ran he that kill&#8217;d Mercutio?<br>
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">There lies that Tybalt.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Up, sir, go with me;<br>
I charge thee in the princes name, obey.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Prince, attended;
Montague, Capulet, their Wives, and others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Where are the vile beginners of this fray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">O noble prince, I can discover all<br>
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:<br>
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,<br>
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother&#8217;s
child!<br>
O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt<br>
O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,<br>
For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.<br>
O cousin, cousin!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?</p>
<p class="speaker">Benvolio</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo&#8217;s hand did
slay;<br>
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink<br>
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal<br>
Your high displeasure: all this uttered<br>
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow&#8217;d,<br>
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen<br>
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts<br>
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio&#8217;s breast,<br>
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,<br>
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats<br>
Cold death aside, and with the other sends<br>
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,<br>
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,<br>
&#8216;Hold, friends! friends, part!&#8217; and, swifter than
his tongue,<br>
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,<br>
And &#8217;twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm<br>
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life<br>
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;<br>
But by and by comes back to Romeo,<br>
Who had but newly entertain&#8217;d revenge,<br>
And to &#8217;t they go like lightning, for, ere I<br>
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.<br>
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.<br>
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">He is a kinsman to the Montague;<br>
Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:<br>
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,<br>
And all those twenty could but kill one life.<br>
I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;<br>
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;<br>
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?</p>
<p class="speaker">Montague</p>
<p class="speech">Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio&#8217;s
friend;<br>
His fault concludes but what the law should end,<br>
The life of Tybalt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince</p>
<p class="speech">And for that offence<br>
Immediately we do exile him hence:<br>
I have an interest in your hate&#8217;s proceeding,<br>
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;<br>
But I&#8217;ll amerce you with so strong a fine<br>
That you shall all repent the loss of mine:<br>
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;<br>
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:<br>
Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,<br>
Else, when he&#8217;s found, that hour is his last.<br>
Bear hence this body and attend our will:<br>
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Capulet&#8217;s orchard.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Juliet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,<br>
Towards Phoebus&#8217; lodging: such a wagoner<br>
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,<br>
And bring in cloudy night immediately.<br>
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,<br>
That runaway&#8217;s eyes may wink and Romeo<br>
Leap to these arms, untalk&#8217;d of and unseen.<br>
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites<br>
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,<br>
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,<br>
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,<br>
And learn me how to lose a winning match,<br>
Play&#8217;d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:<br>
Hood my unmann&#8217;d blood, bating in my cheeks,<br>
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,<br>
Think true love acted simple modesty.<br>
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;<br>
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night<br>
Whiter than new snow on a raven&#8217;s back.<br>
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow&#8217;d night,<br>
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,<br>
Take him and cut him out in little stars,<br>
And he will make the face of heaven so fine<br>
That all the world will be in love with night<br>
And pay no worship to the garish sun.<br>
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,<br>
But not possess&#8217;d it, and, though I am sold,<br>
Not yet enjoy&#8217;d: so tedious is this day<br>
As is the night before some festival<br>
To an impatient child that hath new robes<br>
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,<br>
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks<br>
But Romeo&#8217;s name speaks heavenly eloquence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Nurse, with
cords</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the
cords<br>
That Romeo bid thee fetch?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay, the cords.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Throws them down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy
hands?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ah, well-a-day! he&#8217;s dead, he&#8217;s dead,
he&#8217;s dead!<br>
We are undone, lady, we are undone!<br>
Alack the day! he&#8217;s gone, he&#8217;s kill&#8217;d, he&#8217;s
dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Can heaven be so envious?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo can,<br>
Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!<br>
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What devil art thou, that dost torment me
thus?<br>
This torture should be roar&#8217;d in dismal hell.<br>
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but &#8216;I,&#8217;<br>
And that bare vowel &#8216;I&#8217; shall poison more<br>
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:<br>
I am not I, if there be such an I;<br>
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer &#8216;I.&#8217;<br>
If he be slain, say &#8216;I&#8217;; or if not, no:<br>
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I saw the wound, I saw it with mine
eyes,&#8212;<br>
God save the mark!&#8212;here on his manly breast:<br>
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;<br>
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub&#8217;d in blood,<br>
All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at
once!<br>
To prison, eyes, ne&#8217;er look on liberty!<br>
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;<br>
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!<br>
O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!<br>
That ever I should live to see thee dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">What storm is this that blows so contrary?<br>
Is Romeo slaughter&#8217;d, and is Tybalt dead?<br>
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?<br>
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!<br>
For who is living, if those two are gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;<br>
Romeo that kill&#8217;d him, he is banished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O God! did Romeo&#8217;s hand shed Tybalt&#8217;s
blood?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">It did, it did; alas the day, it did!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!<br>
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?<br>
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!<br>
Dove-feather&#8217;d raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!<br>
Despised substance of divinest show!<br>
Just opposite to what thou justly seem&#8217;st,<br>
A damned saint, an honourable villain!<br>
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,<br>
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend<br>
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?<br>
Was ever book containing such vile matter<br>
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell<br>
In such a gorgeous palace!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s no trust,<br>
No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,<br>
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.<br>
Ah, where&#8217;s my man? give me some aqua vitae:<br>
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.<br>
Shame come to Romeo!</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Blister&#8217;d be thy tongue<br>
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:<br>
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;<br>
For &#8217;tis a throne where honour may be crown&#8217;d<br>
Sole monarch of the universal earth.<br>
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Will you speak well of him that kill&#8217;d your
cousin?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?<br>
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,<br>
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?<br>
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?<br>
That villain cousin would have kill&#8217;d my husband:<br>
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;<br>
Your tributary drops belong to woe,<br>
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.<br>
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;<br>
And Tybalt&#8217;s dead, that would have slain my husband:<br>
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?<br>
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt&#8217;s death,<br>
That murder&#8217;d me: I would forget it fain;<br>
But, O, it presses to my memory,<br>
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners&#8217; minds:<br>
&#8216;Tybalt is dead, and Romeo&#8212;banished;&#8217;<br>
That &#8216;banished,&#8217; that one word
&#8216;banished,&#8217;<br>
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt&#8217;s death<br>
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:<br>
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship<br>
And needly will be rank&#8217;d with other griefs,<br>
Why follow&#8217;d not, when she said &#8216;Tybalt&#8217;s
dead,&#8217;<br>
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,<br>
Which modern lamentations might have moved?<br>
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt&#8217;s death,<br>
&#8216;Romeo is banished,&#8217; to speak that word,<br>
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,<br>
All slain, all dead. &#8216;Romeo is banished!&#8217;<br>
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,<br>
In that word&#8217;s death; no words can that woe sound.<br>
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Weeping and wailing over Tybalt&#8217;s
corse:<br>

<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be
spent,<br>
When theirs are dry, for Romeo&#8217;s banishment.<br>
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,<br>
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:<br>
He made you for a highway to my bed;<br>
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.<br>
Come, cords, come, nurse; I&#8217;ll to my wedding-bed;<br>
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Hie to your chamber: I&#8217;ll find Romeo<br>
To comfort you: I wot well where he is.<br>
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:<br>
I&#8217;ll to him; he is hid at Laurence&#8217; cell.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Friar
Laurence</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful
man:<br>
Affliction is enamour&#8217;d of thy parts,<br>
And thou art wedded to calamity.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Romeo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Father, what news? what is the prince&#8217;s
doom?<br>
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,<br>
That I yet know not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Too familiar<br>
Is my dear son with such sour company:<br>
I bring thee tidings of the prince&#8217;s doom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">What less than dooms-day is the prince&#8217;s
doom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">A gentler judgment vanish&#8217;d from his
lips,<br>
Not body&#8217;s death, but body&#8217;s banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, banishment! be merciful, say
&#8216;death;&#8217;<br>
For exile hath more terror in his look,<br>
Much more than death: do not say &#8216;banishment.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hence from Verona art thou banished:<br>
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">There is no world without Verona walls,<br>
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.<br>
Hence-banished is banish&#8217;d from the world,<br>
And world&#8217;s exile is death: then banished,<br>
Is death mis-term&#8217;d: calling death banishment,<br>
Thou cutt&#8217;st my head off with a golden axe,<br>
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!<br>
Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,<br>
Taking thy part, hath rush&#8217;d aside the law,<br>
And turn&#8217;d that black word death to banishment:<br>
This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is
here,<br>
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog<br>
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,<br>
Live here in heaven and may look on her;<br>
But Romeo may not: more validity,<br>
More honourable state, more courtship lives<br>
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize<br>
On the white wonder of dear Juliet&#8217;s hand<br>
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,<br>
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,<br>
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;<br>
But Romeo may not; he is banished:<br>
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:<br>
They are free men, but I am banished.<br>
And say&#8217;st thou yet that exile is not death?<br>
Hadst thou no poison mix&#8217;d, no sharp-ground knife,<br>
No sudden mean of death, though ne&#8217;er so mean,<br>
But &#8216;banished&#8217; to kill
me?&#8212;&#8217;banished&#8217;?<br>
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;<br>
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,<br>
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,<br>
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess&#8217;d,<br>
To mangle me with that word &#8216;banished&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll give thee armour to keep off that
word:<br>
Adversity&#8217;s sweet milk, philosophy,<br>
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Yet &#8216;banished&#8217;? Hang up
philosophy!<br>
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,<br>
Displant a town, reverse a prince&#8217;s doom,<br>
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">O, then I see that madmen have no ears.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">How should they, when that wise men have no
eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not
feel:<br>
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,<br>
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,<br>
Doting like me and like me banished,<br>
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,<br>
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,<br>
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.</p>

<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O, he is even in my mistress&#8217; case,<br>
Just in her case! O woful sympathy!<br>
Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,<br>
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.<br>
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:<br>
For Juliet&#8217;s sake, for her sake, rise and stand;<br>
Why should you fall into so deep an O?</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Nurse!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death&#8217;s the end of
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?<br>
Doth she not think me an old murderer,<br>
Now I have stain&#8217;d the childhood of our joy<br>
With blood removed but little from her own?<br>
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says<br>
My conceal&#8217;d lady to our cancell&#8217;d love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and
weeps;<br>
And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,<br>
And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,<br>
And then down falls again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Romeo</p>
<p class="speech">As if that name,<br>
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,<br>
Did murder her; as that name&#8217;s cursed hand<br>
Murder&#8217;d her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,<br>
In what vile part of this anatomy<br>
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack<br>
The hateful mansion.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drawing his sword</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Friar Laurence</p>
<p class="speech">Hold thy desperate hand:<br>
Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:<br>
Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote<br>
The unreasonable fury of a beast:<br>
Unseemly woman in a seeming man!<br>
Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!<br>
Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,<br>
I thought thy disposition better temper&#8217;d.<br>
Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?<br>
And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,<br>
By doing damned hate upon thyself?<br>
Why rail&#8217;st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?<br>
Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet<br>
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.<br>
Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;<br>
Which, like a usurer, abound&#8217;st in all,<br>
And usest none in that true use indeed<br>
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:<br>
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,<br>
Digressing from the valour of a man;<br>
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,<br>
Killing that love which thou hast vow&#8217;d to cherish;<br>
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,<br>
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,<br>
Like powder in a skitless soldier&#8217;s flask,<br>
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,<br>
And thou dismember&#8217;d with thine own defence.<br>
What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,<br>
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;<br>
There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,<br>
But thou slew&#8217;st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:<br>
The law that threaten&#8217;d death becomes thy friend<br>
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:<br>
A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;<br>
Happiness courts thee in her best array;<br>
But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,<br>
Thou pout&#8217;st upon thy fortune and thy love:<br>
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.<br>
Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,<br>
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:<br>
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,<br>
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;<br>
Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time<br>
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,<br>
Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back<br>
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy<br>
Than thou went&#8217;st forth in lamentation.<br>
Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;<br>
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,<br>
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:<br>
Romeo is coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">O Lord, I could have stay&#8217;d here all the

Either be gone before the watch be set,<br>
Or by the break of day disguised from hence:<br>
Sojourn in Mantua; I&#8217;ll find out your man,<br>
And he shall signify from time to time<br>
Every good hap to you that chances here:<br>
Give me thy hand; &#8217;tis late: farewell; good night.</p>

No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks<br>
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:<br>
Night&#8217;s candles are burnt out, and jocund day<br>

I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,<br>
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,<br>
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,<br>
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,<br>
And see how he will take it at your hands.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Capulet and
Nurse</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;<br>
But for the sunset of my brother&#8217;s son<br>
It rains downright.<br>
How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?<br>
Evermore showering? In one little body<br>
Thou counterfeit&#8217;st a bark, a sea, a wind;<br>
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,<br>
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,<br>
Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;<br>
Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,<br>
Without a sudden calm, will overset<br>
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!<br>
Have you deliver&#8217;d to her our decree?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you
thanks.<br>
I would the fool were married to her grave!</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Soft! take me with you, take me with you,
wife.<br>
How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?<br>
Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,<br>
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought<br>
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you
have:<br>
Proud can I never be of what I hate;<br>
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?<br>
&#8216;Proud,&#8217; and &#8216;I thank you,&#8217; and &#8216;I
thank you not;&#8217;<br>
And yet &#8216;not proud,&#8217; mistress minion, you,<br>
Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,<br>
But fettle your fine joints &#8217;gainst Thursday next,<br>
To go with Paris to Saint Peter&#8217;s Church,<br>
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.<br>
Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!<br>
You tallow-face!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Fie, fie! what, are you mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Good father, I beseech you on my knees,<br>
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!<br>
I tell thee what: get thee to church o&#8217; Thursday,<br>
Or never after look me in the face:<br>
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;<br>
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest<br>
That God had lent us but this only child;<br>
But now I see this one is one too much,<br>
And that we have a curse in having her:<br>
Out on her, hilding!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">God in heaven bless her!<br>
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,<br>
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">I speak no treason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">O, God ye god-den.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">May not one speak?</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Peace, you mumbling fool!<br>
Utter your gravity o&#8217;er a gossip&#8217;s bowl;<br>
For here we need it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">You are too hot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">God&#8217;s bread! it makes me mad:<br>
Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,<br>
Alone, in company, still my care hath been<br>
To have her match&#8217;d: and having now provided<br>
A gentleman of noble parentage,<br>
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train&#8217;d,<br>
Stuff&#8217;d, as they say, with honourable parts,<br>
Proportion&#8217;d as one&#8217;s thought would wish a man;<br>
And then to have a wretched puling fool,<br>
A whining mammet, in her fortune&#8217;s tender,<br>
To answer &#8216;I&#8217;ll not wed; I cannot love,<br>
I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.&#8217;<br>
But, as you will not wed, I&#8217;ll pardon you:<br>
Graze where you will you shall not house with me:<br>
Look to&#8217;t, think on&#8217;t, I do not use to jest.<br>
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:<br>
An you be mine, I&#8217;ll give you to my friend;<br>
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
the streets,<br>
For, by my soul, I&#8217;ll ne&#8217;er acknowledge thee,<br>
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:<br>
Trust to&#8217;t, bethink you; I&#8217;ll not be forsworn.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,<br>
That sees into the bottom of my grief?<br>
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!<br>
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;<br>
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed<br>
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Capulet</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not to me, for I&#8217;ll not speak a
word:<br>
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">O God!&#8212;O nurse, how shall this be
prevented?<br>
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;<br>
How shall that faith return again to earth,<br>
Unless that husband send it me from heaven<br>
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.<br>
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems<br>
Upon so soft a subject as myself!<br>
What say&#8217;st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?<br>
Some comfort, nurse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Faith, here it is.<br>
Romeo is banish&#8217;d; and all the world to nothing,<br>
That he dares ne&#8217;er come back to challenge you;<br>
Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.<br>
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,<br>
I think it best you married with the county.<br>
O, he&#8217;s a lovely gentleman!<br>
Romeo&#8217;s a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,<br>
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye<br>
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,<br>
I think you are happy in this second match,<br>
For it excels your first: or if it did not,<br>
Your first is dead; or &#8217;twere as good he were,<br>
As living here and you no use of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Speakest thou from thy heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">And from my soul too;<br>
Or else beshrew them both.</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">What?</p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.<br>
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,<br>
Having displeased my father, to Laurence&#8217; cell,<br>
To make confession and to be absolved.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nurse</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Juliet</p>
<p class="speech">Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!<br>
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,<br>
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue<br>
Which she hath praised him with above compare<br>
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;<br>
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.<br>
I&#8217;ll to the friar, to know his remedy:<br>
If all else fail, myself have power to die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
