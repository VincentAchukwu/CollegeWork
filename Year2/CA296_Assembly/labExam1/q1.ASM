;Good code, but you didn't need to check each letter. Once it fell within the range, thats all you needed. Well commented.

IN 00			; GET LETTER, THEN IT STORES INTO AL
MOV BL,61		; LOWERCASE ALPHABET
LOOP:
	CMP AL,BL	; COMPARE CURRENT LETTER TO LOWERCASE LETTERS
	JZ UPDATE	; IF IT MATHCES WITH A LOWERCASE LETTER, WE JUMP TO UPDATE
	INC BL		; ELSE WE KEEP GOING BY INCREMENTING BL
	CMP BL,7B	; KEEP GOING WHILE WE HAVEN'T PASSED LOWERCASE ALPHABET
	JNZ LOOP

UPDATE:

	SUB AL,20	; CONVERT TO UPPERCASE LETTER
	MOV [CL],AL	; DISPLAY IN VDU
