<h3>ACT I</h3>
<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title="Act I, Scene I. Venice. A street.">
<h4>Scene I. Venice. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antonio, Salarino, and
Salanio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br>
It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br>
But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br>
What stuff &#8217;tis made of, whereof it is born,<br>
I am to learn;<br>
And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br>
That I have much ado to know myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br>
There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br>
Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br>
Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br>
Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br>
That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br>
As they fly by them with their woven wings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br>
The better part of my affections would<br>
Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br>
Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br>
Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br>
And every object that might make me fear<br>
Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br>
Would make me sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My wind cooling my broth<br>
Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br>
What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br>
I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br>
But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br>
And see my wealthy Andrew dock&#8217;d in sand,<br>
Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br>
To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br>
And see the holy edifice of stone,<br>
And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br>
Which touching but my gentle vessel&#8217;s side,<br>
Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br>
Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br>
And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br>
And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br>
To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br>
That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br>
But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br>
Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br>
My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br>
Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br>
Upon the fortune of this present year:<br>
Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then you are in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, fie!</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Not in love neither? Then let us say you are
sad,<br>
Because you are not merry: and &#8217;twere as easy<br>
For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,<br>
Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,<br>
Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:<br>
Some that will evermore peep through their eyes<br>
And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,<br>
And other of such vinegar aspect<br>
That they&#8217;ll not show their teeth in way of smile,<br>
Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Bassanio, Lorenzo, and
Gratiano</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,<br>
Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:<br>
We leave you now with better company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">I would have stay&#8217;d till I had made you
merry,<br>
If worthier friends had not prevented me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Your worth is very dear in my regard.<br>
I take it, your own business calls on you<br>
And you embrace the occasion to depart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Good morrow, my good lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say,
when?<br>
You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll make our leisures to attend on
yours.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Salarino and
Salanio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Bassanio, since you have found
Antonio,<br>
We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,<br>
I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">I will not fail you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">You look not well, Signior Antonio;<br>
You have too much respect upon the world:<br>
They lose it that do buy it with much care:<br>
Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;<br>
A stage where every man must play a part,<br>
And mine a sad one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Let me play the fool:<br>
With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,<br>
And let my liver rather heat with wine<br>
Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.<br>
Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,<br>
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?<br>
Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice<br>
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio&#8212;<br>
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks&#8212;<br>
There are a sort of men whose visages<br>
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,<br>
And do a wilful stillness entertain,<br>
With purpose to be dress&#8217;d in an opinion<br>
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,<br>
As who should say &#8216;I am Sir Oracle,<br>
And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!&#8217;<br>
O my Antonio, I do know of these<br>
That therefore only are reputed wise<br>
For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,<br>
If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,<br>
Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee more of this another time:<br>
But fish not, with this melancholy bait,<br>
For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.<br>
Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:<br>
I&#8217;ll end my exhortation after dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Well, we will leave you then till
dinner-time:<br>
I must be one of these same dumb wise men,<br>
For Gratiano never lets me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Well, keep me company but two years moe,<br>
Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Farewell: I&#8217;ll grow a talker for this
gear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, i&#8217; faith, for silence is only
commendable<br>
In a neat&#8217;s tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Gratiano and
Lorenzo</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Is that any thing now?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing,
more
than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
have them, they are not worth the search.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, tell me now what lady is the same<br>
To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,<br>
That you to-day promised to tell me of?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,<br>
How much I have disabled mine estate,<br>
By something showing a more swelling port<br>
Than my faint means would grant continuance:<br>
Nor do I now make moan to be abridged<br>
From such a noble rate; but my chief care<br>
Is to come fairly off from the great debts<br>
Wherein my time something too prodigal<br>
Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,<br>
I owe the most, in money and in love,<br>
And from your love I have a warranty<br>
To unburden all my plots and purposes<br>
How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;<br>
And if it stand, as you yourself still do,<br>
Within the eye of honour, be assured,<br>
My purse, my person, my extremest means,<br>
Lie all unlock&#8217;d to your occasions.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,<br>
I shot his fellow of the self-same flight<br>
The self-same way with more advised watch,<br>
To find the other forth, and by adventuring both<br>
I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,<br>
Because what follows is pure innocence.<br>
I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,<br>
That which I owe is lost; but if you please<br>
To shoot another arrow that self way<br>
Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,<br>
As I will watch the aim, or to find both<br>
Or bring your latter hazard back again<br>
And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">You know me well, and herein spend but time<br>
To wind about my love with circumstance;<br>
And out of doubt you do me now more wrong<br>
In making question of my uttermost<br>
Than if you had made waste of all I have:<br>
Then do but say to me what I should do<br>
That in your knowledge may by me be done,<br>
And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">In Belmont is a lady richly left;<br>
And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,<br>
Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes<br>
I did receive fair speechless messages:<br>
Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued<br>
To Cato&#8217;s daughter, Brutus&#8217; Portia:<br>
Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,<br>
For the four winds blow in from every coast<br>
Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks<br>
Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;<br>
Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos&#8217; strand,<br>
And many Jasons come in quest of her.<br>
O my Antonio, had I but the means<br>
To hold a rival place with one of them,<br>
I have a mind presages me such thrift,<br>
That I should questionless be fortunate!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st that all my fortunes are at
sea;<br>
Neither have I money nor commodity<br>
To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;<br>
Try what my credit can in Venice do:<br>
That shall be rack&#8217;d, even to the uttermost,<br>
To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.<br>
Go, presently inquire, and so will I,<br>
Where money is, and I no question make<br>
To have it of my trust or for my sake.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>

<h4>Scene II: Belmont. A room in Portia&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Portia and
Nerissa</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary
of
this great world.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were
in
the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
competency lives longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Good sentences and well pronounced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">They would be better, if well followed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If to do were as easy as to know what were good
to
do, chapels had been churches and poor men&#8217;s
cottages princes&#8217; palaces. It is a good divine that
follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
o&#8217;er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
youth, to skip o&#8217;er the meshes of good counsel the
cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
choose me a husband. O me, the word &#8216;choose!&#8217; I may
neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at
their
death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
warmth is there in your affection towards any of
these princely suitors that are already come?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou
namest
them, I will describe them; and, according to my
description, level at my affection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">First, there is the Neapolitan prince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that&#8217;s a colt indeed, for he doth
nothing but
talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
mother played false with a smith.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Then there is the County Palatine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">He doth nothing but frown, as who should say
&#8216;If you
will not have me, choose:&#8217; he hears merry tales and
smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
married to a death&#8217;s-head with a bone in his mouth
than to either of these. God defend me from these
two!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le
Bon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">God made him, and therefore let him pass for a
man.
In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
he! why, he hath a horse better than the
Neapolitan&#8217;s, a better bad habit of frowning than
the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
shall never requite him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young
baron
of England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You know I say nothing to him, for he
understands
not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
He is a proper man&#8217;s picture, but, alas, who can
converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
behavior every where.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">What think you of the Scottish lord, his
neighbour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for
he
borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
under for another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">How like you the young German, the Duke of
Saxony&#8217;s nephew?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober,
and
most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
make shift to go without him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">If he should offer to choose, and choose the
right
casket, you should refuse to perform your father&#8217;s
will, if you should refuse to accept him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee,
set a
deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
for if the devil be within and that temptation
without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
thing, Nerissa, ere I&#8217;ll be married to a sponge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">You need not fear, lady, the having any of
these
lords: they have acquainted me with their
determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father&#8217;s
imposition depending on the caskets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die
as
chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
of my father&#8217;s will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
them a fair departure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not remember, lady, in your father&#8217;s
time, a
Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so
called.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my
foolish
eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I remember him well, and I remember him worthy
of
thy praise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a
Serving-man</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! what news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">The four strangers seek for you, madam, to
take
their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
prince his master will be here to-night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good
a
heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should

of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,

Shylock</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Three thousand ducats; well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, for three months.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">For three months; well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be
bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Antonio shall become bound; well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall
I
know your answer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Three thousand ducats for three months and
Antonio bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Your answer to that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Antonio is a good man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Have you heard any imputation to the
contrary?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is
a
good man is to have you understand me that he is
sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
take his bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Be assured you may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I will be assured I may; and, that I may be
assured,<br>
I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">If it please you to dine with us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation
which
your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">This is Signior Antonio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How like a
fawning publican he looks!<br>
I hate him for he is a Christian,<br>
But more for that in low simplicity<br>
He lends out money gratis and brings down<br>
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.<br>
If I can catch him once upon the hip,<br>
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.<br>
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,<br>
Even there where merchants most do congregate,<br>
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,<br>
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,<br>
If I forgive him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Shylock, do you hear?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I am debating of my present store,<br>
And, by the near guess of my memory,<br>
I cannot instantly raise up the gross<br>
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?<br>
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,<br>
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months<br>
Do you desire?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Antonio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Rest you fair, good signior;<br>
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow<br>
By taking nor by giving of excess,<br>
Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,<br>
I&#8217;ll break a custom. Is he yet possess&#8217;d<br>
How much ye would?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And for three months.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I had forgot; three months; you told me so.<br>
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;<br>
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow<br>
Upon advantage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I do never use it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban&#8217;s
sheep&#8212;<br>
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,<br>
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,<br>
The third possessor; ay, he was the third&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">And what of him? did he take interest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">No, not take interest, not, as you would say,<br>
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.<br>
When Laban and himself were compromised<br>
That all the eanlings which were streak&#8217;d and pied<br>
Should fall as Jacob&#8217;s hire, the ewes, being rank,<br>
In the end of autumn turned to the rams,<br>
And, when the work of generation was<br>
Between these woolly breeders in the act,<br>
The skilful shepherd peel&#8217;d me certain wands,<br>
And, in the doing of the deed of kind,<br>
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,<br>
Who then conceiving did in eaning time<br>
Fall parti-colour&#8217;d lambs, and those were Jacob&#8217;s.<br>
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:<br>
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served
for;<br>
A thing not in his power to bring to pass,<br>
But sway&#8217;d and fashion&#8217;d by the hand of heaven.<br>
Was this inserted to make interest good?<br>
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:<br>
But note me, signior.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Mark you this, Bassanio,<br>
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.<br>
An evil soul producing holy witness<br>
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,<br>
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:<br>
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Three thousand ducats; &#8217;tis a good round
sum.<br>
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Signior Antonio, many a time and oft<br>
In the Rialto you have rated me<br>
About my moneys and my usances:<br>
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,<br>
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.<br>
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,<br>
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,<br>
And all for use of that which is mine own.<br>
Well then, it now appears you need my help:<br>
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say<br>
&#8217;shylock, we would have moneys:&#8217; you say so;<br>
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard<br>
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur<br>
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit<br>
What should I say to you? Should I not say<br>
&#8216;Hath a dog money? is it possible<br>
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?&#8217; Or<br>
Shall I bend low and in a bondman&#8217;s key,<br>
With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;<br>
&#8216;Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;<br>
You spurn&#8217;d me such a day; another time<br>
You call&#8217;d me dog; and for these courtesies<br>
I&#8217;ll lend you thus much moneys&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am as like to call thee so again,<br>
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.<br>
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not<br>
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take<br>
A breed for barren metal of his friend?<br>
But lend it rather to thine enemy,<br>
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face<br>
Exact the penalty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, look you, how you storm!<br>
I would be friends with you and have your love,<br>
Forget the shames that you have stain&#8217;d me with,<br>
Supply your present wants and take no doit<br>
Of usance for my moneys, and you&#8217;ll not hear me:<br>
This is kind I offer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">This were kindness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">This kindness will I show.<br>
Go with me to a notary, seal me there<br>
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,<br>
If you repay me not on such a day,<br>
In such a place, such sum or sums as are<br>
Express&#8217;d in the condition, let the forfeit<br>
Be nominated for an equal pound<br>
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken<br>
In what part of your body pleaseth me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Content, i&#8217; faith: I&#8217;ll seal to such
a bond<br>
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">You shall not seal to such a bond for me:<br>
I&#8217;ll rather dwell in my necessity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:<br>
Within these two months, that&#8217;s a month before<br>
This bond expires, I do expect return<br>
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">O father Abram, what these Christians are,<br>
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect<br>
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;<br>
If he should break his day, what should I gain<br>
By the exaction of the forfeiture?<br>
A pound of man&#8217;s flesh taken from a man<br>
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,<br>
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,<br>
To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:<br>
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;<br>
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Then meet me forthwith at the notary&#8217;s;<br>
Give him direction for this merry bond,<br>
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,<br>
See to my house, left in the fearful guard<br>
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently<br>
I will be with you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Hie thee, gentle Jew.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Shylock</span></p>

fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is

me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more

up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
have run some ground. My master&#8217;s a very Jew: give
him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
his service; you may tell every finger I have with
my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I

have
ne&#8217;er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
here&#8217;s a simple line of life: here&#8217;s a small trifle
of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
man: and then to &#8217;scape drowning thrice, and to be
in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
woman, she&#8217;s a good wench for this gear. Father,
come; I&#8217;ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an
eye.</p>

Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;<br>
Parts that become thee happily enough<br>
And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;<br>
But where thou art not known, why, there they show<br>
Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain<br>
To allay with some cold drops of modesty<br>
Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior<br>
I be misconstrued in the place I go to,<br>
And lose my hopes.</p>

Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes<br>
Thus with my hat, and sigh and say &#8216;amen,&#8217;<br>
Use all the observance of civility,<br>
Like one well studied in a sad ostent<br>
To please his grandam, never trust me more.</p>

May not extend so far as to the lady:<br>
And yet to be afeard of my deserving<br>
Were but a weak disabling of myself.<br>
As much as I deserve! Why, that&#8217;s the lady:<br>
I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,<br>
In graces and in qualities of breeding;<br>
But more than these, in love I do deserve.<br>
What if I stray&#8217;d no further, but chose here?<br>

To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.<br>
Or shall I think in silver she&#8217;s immured,<br>
Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?<br>
O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem<br>
Was set in worse than gold. They have in England<br>
A coin that bears the figure of an angel<br>
Stamped in gold, but that&#8217;s insculp&#8217;d upon;<br>

<p class="speech">Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:<br>
With him is Gratiano gone along;<br>
And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">The villain Jew with outcries raised the
duke,<br>
Who went with him to search Bassanio&#8217;s ship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">He came too late, the ship was under sail:<br>
But there the duke was given to understand<br>
That in a gondola were seen together<br>
Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:<br>
Besides, Antonio certified the duke<br>
They were not with Bassanio in his ship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">I never heard a passion so confused,<br>
So strange, outrageous, and so variable,<br>
As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:<br>
&#8216;My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!<br>
Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!<br>
Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!<br>
A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,<br>
Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!<br>
And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,<br>
Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;<br>
She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,<br>
Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Let good Antonio look he keep his day,<br>
Or he shall pay for this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, well remember&#8217;d.<br>
I reason&#8217;d with a Frenchman yesterday,<br>
Who told me, in the narrow seas that part<br>
The French and English, there miscarried<br>
A vessel of our country richly fraught:<br>
I thought upon Antonio when he told me;<br>
And wish&#8217;d in silence that it were not his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;<br>
Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.<br>
I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:<br>
Bassanio told him he would make some speed<br>
Of his return: he answer&#8217;d, &#8216;Do not so;<br>
Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio<br>
But stay the very riping of the time;<br>
And for the Jew&#8217;s bond which he hath of me,<br>
Let it not enter in your mind of love:<br>
Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts<br>
To courtship and such fair ostents of love<br>
As shall conveniently become you there:&#8217;<br>
And even there, his eye being big with tears,<br>
Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,<br>
And with affection wondrous sensible<br>
He wrung Bassanio&#8217;s hand; and so they parted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">I think he only loves the world for him.<br>
I pray thee, let us go and find him out<br>
And quicken his embraced heaviness<br>
With some delight or other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Do we so.</p>

Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume<br>

O, that estates, degrees and offices<br>
Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour<br>

How many then should cover that stand bare!<br>

How much low peasantry would then be glean&#8217;d<br>
From the true seed of honour! and how much honour<br>

<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Why, yet it lives there uncheck&#8217;d that
Antonio hath
a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
Report be an honest woman of her word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">I would she were as lying a gossip in that as
ever
knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
honest Antonio,&#8212;O that I had a title good enough
to keep his name company!&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Come, the full stop.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he

<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>

<p class="speech">How now, Shylock! what news among the

<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">You know, none so well, none so well as you, of
my
daughter&#8217;s flight.</p>

<p class="speech">That&#8217;s certain: I, for my part, knew the
tailor
that made the wings she flew withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird
was
fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
to leave the dam.</p>

<p class="speech">She is damned for it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s certain, if the devil may be her

<p class="speech">My own flesh and blood to rebel!</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these
years?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">There is more difference between thy flesh and
hers
than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
loss at sea or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
look to his bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salarino</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not
take
his flesh: what&#8217;s that good for?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing
else,
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
enemies; and what&#8217;s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
will better the instruction.</p>

<p class="speech">I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot
find her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond
gone,
cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
not what&#8217;s spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
but of my shedding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tubal</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as
I
heard in Genoa,&#8212;</p>

<p class="speech">I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the
wreck.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good
news!
ha, ha! where? in Genoa?</p>
<p class="speaker">Tubal</p>
<p class="speech">Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in
one
night fourscore ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see
my
gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
fourscore ducats!</p>
<p class="speaker">Tubal</p>
<p class="speech">There came divers of Antonio&#8217;s creditors in
my
company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I am very glad of it: I&#8217;ll plague him;
I&#8217;ll torture
him: I am glad of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tubal</p>
<p class="speech">One of them showed me a ring that he had of
your
daughter for a monkey.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was
my
turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Tubal</p>
<p class="speech">But Antonio is certainly undone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s true, that&#8217;s very true.
Go, Tubal, fee
me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.</p>

Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,<br>
I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.<br>
There&#8217;s something tells me, but it is not love,<br>
I would not lose you; and you know yourself,<br>
Hate counsels not in such a quality.<br>
But lest you should not understand me well,&#8212;<br>
And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,&#8212;<br>
I would detain you here some month or two<br>
Before you venture for me. I could teach you<br>
How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;<br>
So will I never be: so may you miss me;<br>
But if you do, you&#8217;ll make me wish a sin,<br>
That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,<br>
They have o&#8217;erlook&#8217;d me and divided me;<br>
One half of me is yours, the other half yours,<br>
Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,<br>
And so all yours. O, these naughty times<br>
Put bars between the owners and their rights!<br>
And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,<br>
Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.<br>
I speak too long; but &#8217;tis to peize the time,<br>

For as I am, I live upon the rack.</p>

Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,<br>
Fading in music: that the comparison<br>
May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream<br>
And watery death-bed for him. He may win;<br>
And what is music then? Then music is<br>
Even as the flourish when true subjects bow<br>
To a new-crowned monarch: such it is<br>
As are those dulcet sounds in break of day<br>
That creep into the dreaming bridegroom&#8217;s ear,<br>
And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,<br>
With no less presence, but with much more love,<br>
Than young Alcides, when he did redeem<br>
The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy<br>
To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice<br>
The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,<br>
With bleared visages, come forth to view<br>
The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!<br>

The world is still deceived with ornament.<br>
In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,<br>
But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,<br>
Obscures the show of evil? In religion,<br>
What damned error, but some sober brow<br>
Will bless it and approve it with a text,<br>
Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?<br>
There is no vice so simple but assumes<br>
Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:<br>
How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false<br>
As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins<br>
The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;<br>
Who, inward search&#8217;d, have livers white as milk;<br>
And these assume but valour&#8217;s excrement<br>
To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,<br>
And you shall see &#8217;tis purchased by the weight;<br>
Which therein works a miracle in nature,<br>
Making them lightest that wear most of it:<br>
So are those crisped snaky golden locks<br>
Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,<br>
Upon supposed fairness, often known<br>
To be the dowry of a second head,<br>
The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.<br>
Thus ornament is but the guiled shore<br>
To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf<br>
Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,<br>
The seeming truth which cunning times put on<br>
To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,<br>
Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;<br>
Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge<br>
&#8217;Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,<br>

Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;<br>
And here choose I; joy be the consequence!</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How all the
other passions fleet to air,<br>
As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,<br>

I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,<br>
For fear I surfeit.</p>

<p class="speech">What find I here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Opening the leaden
casket</span></p>
<p class="speech">Fair Portia&#8217;s counterfeit! What
demi-god<br>
Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?<br>
Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,<br>
Seem they in motion? Here are sever&#8217;d lips,<br>
Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar<br>
Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs<br>
The painter plays the spider and hath woven<br>
A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,<br>
Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,&#8212;<br>
How could he see to do them? having made one,<br>
Methinks it should have power to steal both his<br>
And leave itself unfurnish&#8217;d. Yet look, how far<br>
The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow<br>
In underprizing it, so far this shadow<br>
Doth limp behind the substance. Here&#8217;s the scroll,<br>
The continent and summary of my fortune.</p>
<p class="speech verse"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
You that choose not by the view,<br>
Chance as fair and choose as true!<br>
Since this fortune falls to you,<br>
Be content and seek no new,<br>
If you be well pleased with this<br>
And hold your fortune for your bliss,<br>
Turn you where your lady is<br>
And claim her with a loving kiss.</p>
<p class="speech">A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;<br>
I come by note, to give and to receive.<br>
Like one of two contending in a prize,<br>
That thinks he hath done well in people&#8217;s eyes,<br>
Hearing applause and universal shout,<br>
Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt<br>
Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;<br>
So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;<br>
As doubtful whether what I see be true,<br>
Until confirm&#8217;d, sign&#8217;d, ratified by you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,<br>
Such as I am: though for myself alone<br>
I would not be ambitious in my wish,<br>
To wish myself much better; yet, for you<br>
I would be trebled twenty times myself;<br>
A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;<br>
That only to stand high in your account,<br>
I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,<br>
Exceed account; but the full sum of me<br>
Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,<br>
Is an unlesson&#8217;d girl, unschool&#8217;d, unpractised;<br>
Happy in this, she is not yet so old<br>
But she may learn; happier than this,<br>
She is not bred so dull but she can learn;<br>
Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit<br>
Commits itself to yours to be directed,<br>
As from her lord, her governor, her king.<br>
Myself and what is mine to you and yours<br>
Is now converted: but now I was the lord<br>
Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,<br>
Queen o&#8217;er myself: and even now, but now,<br>
This house, these servants and this same myself<br>
Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;<br>
Which when you part from, lose, or give away,<br>
Let it presage the ruin of your love<br>
And be my vantage to exclaim on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, you have bereft me of all words,<br>
Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;<br>
And there is such confusion in my powers,<br>
As after some oration fairly spoke<br>
By a beloved prince, there doth appear<br>
Among the buzzing pleased multitude;<br>
Where every something, being blent together,<br>
Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,<br>
Express&#8217;d and not express&#8217;d. But when this ring<br>
Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:<br>
O, then be bold to say Bassanio&#8217;s dead!</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">My lord and lady, it is now our time,<br>
That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,<br>
To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,<br>
I wish you all the joy that you can wish;<br>
For I am sure you can wish none from me:<br>
And when your honours mean to solemnize<br>
The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,<br>
Even at that time I may be married too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your lordship, you have got me one.<br>
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:<br>
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;<br>
You loved, I loved for intermission.<br>
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.<br>
Your fortune stood upon the casket there,<br>
And so did mine too, as the matter falls;<br>
For wooing here until I sweat again,<br>
And sweating until my very roof was dry<br>
With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,<br>
I got a promise of this fair one here<br>
To have her love, provided that your fortune<br>
Achieved her mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Is this true, Nerissa?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, faith, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Our feast shall be much honour&#8217;d in your
marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll play with them the first boy for a
thousand ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">What, and stake down?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">No; we shall ne&#8217;er win at that sport, and
stake down.
But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
and my old Venetian friend Salanio?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lorenzo, Jessica, and
Salanio, a Messenger from Venice</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Lorenzo and Salanio, welcome hither;<br>
If that the youth of my new interest here<br>
Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,<br>
I bid my very friends and countrymen,<br>
Sweet Portia, welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">So do I, my lord:<br>
They are entirely welcome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,<br>
My purpose was not to have seen you here;<br>
But meeting with Salanio by the way,<br>
He did entreat me, past all saying nay,<br>
To come with him along.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">I did, my lord;<br>
And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio<br>
Commends him to you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gives Bassanio a
letter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Ere I ope his letter,<br>
I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;<br>
Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there<br>
Will show you his estate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.<br>
Your hand, Salanio: what&#8217;s the news from Venice?<br>
How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?<br>
I know he will be glad of our success;<br>
We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">I would you had won the fleece that he hath
lost.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">There are some shrewd contents in yon same
paper,<br>
That steals the colour from Bassanio&#8217;s cheek:<br>
Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world<br>
Could turn so much the constitution<br>
Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!<br>
With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,<br>
And I must freely have the half of anything<br>
That this same paper brings you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">O sweet Portia,<br>
Here are a few of the unpleasant&#8217;st words<br>
That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,<br>
When I did first impart my love to you,<br>
I freely told you, all the wealth I had<br>
Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;<br>
And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,<br>
Rating myself at nothing, you shall see<br>
How much I was a braggart. When I told you<br>
My state was nothing, I should then have told you<br>
That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,<br>
I have engaged myself to a dear friend,<br>
Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,<br>
To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;<br>
The paper as the body of my friend,<br>
And every word in it a gaping wound,<br>
Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salanio?<br>
Have all his ventures fail&#8217;d? What, not one hit?<br>
From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,<br>
From Lisbon, Barbary and India?<br>
And not one vessel &#8217;scape the dreadful touch<br>
Of merchant-marring rocks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">Not one, my lord.<br>
Besides, it should appear, that if he had<br>
The present money to discharge the Jew,<br>
He would not take it. Never did I know<br>
A creature, that did bear the shape of man,<br>
So keen and greedy to confound a man:<br>
He plies the duke at morning and at night,<br>
And doth impeach the freedom of the state,<br>
If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,<br>
The duke himself, and the magnificoes<br>
Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;<br>
But none can drive him from the envious plea<br>
Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">When I was with him I have heard him swear<br>
To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,<br>
That he would rather have Antonio&#8217;s flesh<br>
Than twenty times the value of the sum<br>
That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,<br>
If law, authority and power deny not,<br>
It will go hard with poor Antonio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Is it your dear friend that is thus in
trouble?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,<br>
The best-condition&#8217;d and unwearied spirit<br>
In doing courtesies, and one in whom<br>
The ancient Roman honour more appears<br>
Than any that draws breath in Italy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">What sum owes he the Jew?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">For me three thousand ducats.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">What, no more?<br>
Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;<br>
Double six thousand, and then treble that,<br>
Before a friend of this description<br>
Shall lose a hair through Bassanio&#8217;s fault.<br>
First go with me to church and call me wife,<br>
And then away to Venice to your friend;<br>
For never shall you lie by Portia&#8217;s side<br>
With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold<br>
To pay the petty debt twenty times over:<br>
When it is paid, bring your true friend along.<br>
My maid Nerissa and myself meantime<br>
Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!<br>
For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:<br>
Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:<br>
Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.<br>
But let me hear the letter of your friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span> Sweet
Bassanio, my ships have all
miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
let not my letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Since I have your good leave to go away,<br>
I will make haste: but, till I come again,<br>

No rest be interposer &#8217;twixt us twain.</p>

<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, although I speak it in your presence,<br>
You have a noble and a true conceit<br>

In bearing thus the absence of your lord.<br>
But if you knew to whom you show this honour,<br>

I know you would be prouder of the work<br>
Than customary bounty can enforce you.</p>

<p class="speech">I never did repent for doing good,<br>
Nor shall not now: for in companions<br>
That do converse and waste the time together,<br>
Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,<br>
There must be needs a like proportion<br>
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;<br>
Which makes me think that this Antonio,<br>
Being the bosom lover of my lord,<br>
Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,<br>
How little is the cost I have bestow&#8217;d<br>
In purchasing the semblance of my soul<br>
From out the state of hellish misery!<br>
This comes too near the praising of myself;<br>

promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
hope neither.</p>

you
not, that you are not the Jew&#8217;s daughter.</p>

<p class="speech">That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so
the
sins of my mother should be visited upon me.</p>

<p class="speech">Truly, the more to blame he: we were
Christians
enow before; e&#8217;en as many as could well live, one by
another. This making Christians will raise the

you thus get my wife into corners.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and
I
are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
me in heaven, because I am a Jew&#8217;s daughter: and he
says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
price of pork.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">I shall answer that better to the commonwealth
than
you can the getting up of the negro&#8217;s belly: the
Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launcelot</p>

reason:

And if on earth he do not mean it, then<br>
In reason he should never come to heaven<br>
Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match<br>
And on the wager lay two earthly women,<br>
And Portia one, there must be something else<br>
Pawn&#8217;d with the other, for the poor rude world<br>
Hath not her fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Even such a husband<br>
Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let me praise you while I have a
stomach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;<br>
&#8217; Then, howso&#8217;er thou speak&#8217;st, &#8217;mong other
things<br>
I shall digest it.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter the Duke, the
Magnificoes, Antonio, Bassanio, Gratiano, Salanio, and
others</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">What, is Antonio here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Ready, so please your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer<br>
A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch<br>
Uncapable of pity, void and empty<br>
From any dram of mercy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I have heard<br>
Your grace hath ta&#8217;en great pains to qualify<br>
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate<br>
And that no lawful means can carry me<br>
Out of his envy&#8217;s reach, I do oppose<br>
My patience to his fury, and am arm&#8217;d<br>
To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,<br>
The very tyranny and rage of his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Go one, and call the Jew into the court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Shylock</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Make room, and let him stand before our face.<br>
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,<br>
That thou but lead&#8217;st this fashion of thy malice<br>
To the last hour of act; and then &#8217;tis thought<br>
Thou&#8217;lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange<br>
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;<br>
And where thou now exact&#8217;st the penalty,<br>
Which is a pound of this poor merchant&#8217;s flesh,<br>
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,<br>
But, touch&#8217;d with human gentleness and love,<br>
Forgive a moiety of the principal;<br>
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,<br>
That have of late so huddled on his back,<br>
Enow to press a royal merchant down<br>
And pluck commiseration of his state<br>
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,<br>
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train&#8217;d<br>
To offices of tender courtesy.<br>
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I have possess&#8217;d your grace of what I
purpose;<br>
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn<br>
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:<br>
If you deny it, let the danger light<br>
Upon your charter and your city&#8217;s freedom.<br>
You&#8217;ll ask me, why I rather choose to have<br>
A weight of carrion flesh than to receive<br>
Three thousand ducats: I&#8217;ll not answer that:<br>
But, say, it is my humour: is it answer&#8217;d?<br>
What if my house be troubled with a rat<br>
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats<br>
To have it baned? What, are you answer&#8217;d yet?<br>
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;<br>
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;<br>
And others, when the bagpipe sings i&#8217; the nose,<br>
Cannot contain their urine: for affection,<br>
Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood<br>
Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:<br>
As there is no firm reason to be render&#8217;d,<br>
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;<br>
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;<br>
Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force<br>
Must yield to such inevitable shame<br>
As to offend, himself being offended;<br>
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,<br>
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing<br>
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus<br>
A losing suit against him. Are you answer&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,<br>
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I am not bound to please thee with my
answers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Do all men kill the things they do not love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Hates any man the thing he would not kill?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Every offence is not a hate at first.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, think you question with the Jew:<br>
You may as well go stand upon the beach<br>
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;<br>
You may as well use question with the wolf<br>
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;<br>
You may as well forbid the mountain pines<br>
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,<br>
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;<br>
You may as well do anything most hard,<br>
As seek to soften that&#8212;than which what&#8217;s
harder?&#8212;<br>
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,<br>
Make no more offers, use no farther means,<br>
But with all brief and plain conveniency<br>
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">For thy three thousand ducats here is six.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">What judgment shall I dread, doing<br>
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,<br>
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering
none?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?<br>
You have among you many a purchased slave,<br>
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,<br>
You use in abject and in slavish parts,<br>
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,<br>
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?<br>
Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds<br>
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates<br>
Be season&#8217;d with such viands? You will answer<br>
&#8216;The slaves are ours:&#8217; so do I answer you:<br>
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,<br>
Is dearly bought; &#8217;tis mine and I will have it.<br>
If you deny me, fie upon your law!<br>
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.<br>
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my power I may dismiss this court,<br>
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,<br>
Whom I have sent for to determine this,<br>
Come here to-day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Salanio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, here stays without<br>
A messenger with letters from the doctor,<br>
New come from Padua.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Bring us the letter; call the messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!<br>
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,<br>
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am a tainted wether of the flock,<br>
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit<br>
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me<br>
You cannot better be employ&#8217;d, Bassanio,<br>
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Nerissa, dressed like a
lawyer&#8217;s clerk</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Came you from Padua, from Bellario?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">From both, my lord. Bellario greets your
grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Presenting a
letter</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt
there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,<br>
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,<br>
No, not the hangman&#8217;s axe, bear half the keenness<br>
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">O, be thou damn&#8217;d, inexecrable dog!<br>
And for thy life let justice be accused.<br>
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith<br>
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,<br>
That souls of animals infuse themselves<br>
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit<br>
Govern&#8217;d a wolf, who, hang&#8217;d for human slaughter,<br>
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,<br>
And, whilst thou lay&#8217;st in thy unhallow&#8217;d dam,<br>
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires<br>
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Till thou canst rail the seal from off my
bond,<br>
Thou but offend&#8217;st thy lungs to speak so loud:<br>
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall<br>
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This letter from Bellario doth commend<br>
A young and learned doctor to our court.<br>
Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;He attendeth here hard by,<br>
To know your answer, whether you&#8217;ll admit him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart. Some three or four of you<br>
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.<br>
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario&#8217;s letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clerk</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o&#8217;er
many books together: he is furnished with my
opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace&#8217;s
request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
old a head. I leave him to your gracious
acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
commendation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">You hear the learn&#8217;d Bellario, what he
writes:<br>
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Portia, dressed like a
doctor of laws</span></p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand. Come you from old
Bellario?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I did, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;You are welcome: take your
place.<br>
Are you acquainted with the difference<br>
That holds this present question in the court?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I am informed thoroughly of the cause.<br>
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Is your name Shylock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Shylock is my name.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;<br>
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law<br>
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.<br>
You stand within his danger, do you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, so he says.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Do you confess the bond?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Then must the Jew be merciful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">On what compulsion must I? tell me that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">The quality of mercy is not strain&#8217;d,<br>
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br>
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;<br>
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:<br>
&#8217;Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes<br>
The throned monarch better than his crown;<br>
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br>
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br>
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br>
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;<br>
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,<br>
It is an attribute to God himself;<br>
And earthly power doth then show likest God&#8217;s<br>
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,<br>
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,<br>
That, in the course of justice, none of us<br>
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;<br>
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render<br>
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much<br>
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;<br>
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice<br>
Must needs give sentence &#8217;gainst the merchant there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,<br>
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Is he not able to discharge the money?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;<br>
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,<br>
I will be bound to pay it ten times o&#8217;er,<br>
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:<br>
If this will not suffice, it must appear<br>
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,<br>
Wrest once the law to your authority:<br>
To do a great right, do a little wrong,<br>
And curb this cruel devil of his will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">It must not be; there is no power in Venice<br>
Can alter a decree established:<br>
&#8217;Twill be recorded for a precedent,<br>
And many an error by the same example<br>
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!<br>
O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, let me look upon the bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Here &#8217;tis, most reverend doctor, here it
is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Shylock, there&#8217;s thrice thy money
offer&#8217;d thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:<br>
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?<br>
No, not for Venice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this bond is forfeit;<br>
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim<br>
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off<br>
Nearest the merchant&#8217;s heart. Be merciful:<br>
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">When it is paid according to the tenor.<br>
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;<br>
You know the law, your exposition<br>
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,<br>
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,<br>
Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear<br>
There is no power in the tongue of man<br>
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Most heartily I do beseech the court<br>
To give the judgment.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, thus it is:<br>
You must prepare your bosom for his knife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">O noble judge! O excellent young man!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">For the intent and purpose of the law<br>
Hath full relation to the penalty,<br>
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true: O wise and upright
judge!<br>
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore lay bare your bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, his breast:<br>
So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?<br>
&#8216;Nearest his heart:&#8217; those are the very words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">It is so. Are there balance here to weigh<br>
The flesh?</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I have them ready.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your
charge,<br>
To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Is it so nominated in the bond?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">It is not so express&#8217;d: but what of
that?<br>
&#8217;Twere good you do so much for charity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot find it; &#8217;tis not in the bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You, merchant, have you any thing to say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">But little: I am arm&#8217;d and well
prepared.<br>
Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!<br>
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;<br>
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind<br>
Than is her custom: it is still her use<br>
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,<br>
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow<br>
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance<br>
Of such misery doth she cut me off.<br>
Commend me to your honourable wife:<br>
Tell her the process of Antonio&#8217;s end;<br>
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;<br>
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge<br>
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.<br>
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,<br>
And he repents not that he pays your debt;<br>
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,<br>
I&#8217;ll pay it presently with all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Antonio, I am married to a wife<br>
Which is as dear to me as life itself;<br>
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,<br>
Are not with me esteem&#8217;d above thy life:<br>
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all<br>
Here to this devil, to deliver you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Your wife would give you little thanks for
that,<br>
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:<br>
I would she were in heaven, so she could<br>
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well you offer it behind her back;<br>
The wish would make else an unquiet house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">These be the Christian husbands. I have a
daughter;<br>
Would any of the stock of Barrabas<br>
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">A pound of that same merchant&#8217;s flesh is
thine:<br>
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Most rightful judge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">And you must cut this flesh from off his
breast:<br>
The law allows it, and the court awards it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Most learned judge! A sentence! Come,
prepare!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry a little; there is something else.<br>
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;<br>
The words expressly are &#8216;a pound of flesh:&#8217;<br>
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;<br>
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed<br>
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods<br>
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate<br>
Unto the state of Venice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Is that the law?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thyself shalt see the act:<br>
For, as thou urgest justice, be assured<br>
Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice<br>
And let the Christian go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Here is the money.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Soft!<br>
The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:<br>
He shall have nothing but the penalty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.<br>
Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more<br>
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut&#8217;st more<br>
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much<br>
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,<br>
Or the division of the twentieth part<br>
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn<br>
But in the estimation of a hair,<br>
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!<br>
Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Give me my principal, and let me go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">I have it ready for thee; here it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">He hath refused it in the open court:<br>
He shall have merely justice and his bond.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!<br>
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Shall I not have barely my principal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,<br>
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then the devil give him good of it!<br>
I&#8217;ll stay no longer question.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, Jew:<br>
The law hath yet another hold on you.<br>
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,<br>
If it be proved against an alien<br>
That by direct or indirect attempts<br>
He seek the life of any citizen,<br>
The party &#8217;gainst the which he doth contrive<br>
Shall seize one half his goods; the other half<br>
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;<br>
And the offender&#8217;s life lies in the mercy<br>
Of the duke only, &#8217;gainst all other voice.<br>
In which predicament, I say, thou stand&#8217;st;<br>
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,<br>
That indirectly and directly too<br>
Thou hast contrived against the very life<br>
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr&#8217;d<br>
The danger formerly by me rehearsed.<br>
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang
thyself:<br>
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,<br>
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;<br>

charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>

spirits,<br>
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:<br>

<p class="speech">Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Shylock</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:<br>
You take my house when you do take the prop<br>
That doth sustain my house; you take my life<br>
When you do take the means whereby I live.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">What mercy can you render him, Antonio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">A halter gratis; nothing else, for God&#8217;s
sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">So please my lord the duke and all the court<br>
To quit the fine for one half of his goods,<br>
I am content; so he will let me have<br>
The other half in use, to render it,<br>
Upon his death, unto the gentleman<br>
That lately stole his daughter:<br>
Two things provided more, that, for this favour,<br>
He presently become a Christian;<br>
The other, that he do record a gift,<br>
Here in the court, of all he dies possess&#8217;d,<br>
Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>

I pray you, know me when we meet again:<br>
I wish you well, and so I take my leave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Dear sir, of force I must attempt you
further:<br>
Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,<br>
Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,<br>
Not to deny me, and to pardon me.</p>

I will not shame myself to give you this.</p>

And now methinks I have a mind to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>

The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,<br>
And find it out by proclamation:<br>
Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I see, sir, you are liberal in offers<br>
You taught me first to beg; and now methinks<br>
You teach me how a beggar should be answer&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;<br>
And when she put it on, she made me vow<br>
That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">That &#8217;scuse serves many men to save their
gifts.<br>
An if your wife be not a mad-woman,<br>

She would not hold out enemy for ever,<br>
For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!</p>

Here will we sit and let the sounds of music<br>
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night<br>
Become the touches of sweet harmony.<br>
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven<br>
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:<br>
There&#8217;s not the smallest orb which thou behold&#8217;st<br>
But in his motion like an angel sings,<br>
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;<br>
Such harmony is in immortal souls;<br>
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.</p>

<p class="speaker">Jessica</p>
<p class="speech">I am never merry when I hear sweet music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">The reason is, your spirits are attentive:<br>
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,<br>
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,<br>
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,<br>
Which is the hot condition of their blood;<br>
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,<br>
Or any air of music touch their ears,<br>
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,<br>
Their savage eyes turn&#8217;d to a modest gaze<br>
By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet<br>
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;<br>
Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,<br>
But music for the time doth change his nature.<br>
The man that hath no music in himself,<br>
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,<br>
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;<br>
The motions of his spirit are dull as night<br>
And his affections dark as Erebus:<br>
Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.</p>

<p class="speech">When the moon shone, we did not see the
candle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">So doth the greater glory dim the less:<br>
A substitute shines brightly as a king<br>
Unto the king be by, and then his state<br>
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook<br>
Into the main of waters. Music! hark!</p>

<p class="speech">The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,<br>
When neither is attended, and I think<br>
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,<br>
When every goose is cackling, would be thought<br>
No better a musician than the wren.<br>
How many things by season season&#8217;d are<br>
To their right praise and true perfection!<br>

This is the man, this is Antonio,<br>
To whom I am so infinitely bound.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>

<p class="speech">No more than I am well acquitted of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, you are very welcome to our house:<br>
It must appear in other ways than words,<br>
Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Nerissa]</span> By yonder
moon I swear you do me wrong;<br>
In faith, I gave it to the judge&#8217;s clerk:<br>
Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,<br>
Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">A quarrel, ho, already! what&#8217;s the
matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring<br>
That she did give me, whose posy was<br>
For all the world like cutler&#8217;s poetry<br>
Upon a knife, &#8216;Love me, and leave me not.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">What talk you of the posy or the value?<br>
You swore to me, when I did give it you,<br>
That you would wear it till your hour of death<br>
And that it should lie with you in your grave:<br>
Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,<br>
You should have been respective and have kept it.<br>
Gave it a judge&#8217;s clerk! no, God&#8217;s my judge,<br>
The clerk will ne&#8217;er wear hair on&#8217;s face that had
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">He will, an if he live to be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if a woman live to be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,<br>
A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,<br>
No higher than thyself; the judge&#8217;s clerk,<br>
A prating boy, that begg&#8217;d it as a fee:<br>
I could not for my heart deny it him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">You were to blame, I must be plain with you,<br>
To part so slightly with your wife&#8217;s first gift:<br>
A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger<br>
And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.<br>
I gave my love a ring and made him swear<br>
Never to part with it; and here he stands;<br>
I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it<br>
Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth<br>
That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,<br>
You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:<br>
An &#8217;twere to me, I should be mad at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Why, I were
best to cut my left hand off<br>

<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away<br>
Unto the judge that begg&#8217;d it and indeed<br>
Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,<br>
That took some pains in writing, he begg&#8217;d mine;<br>
And neither man nor master would take aught<br>
But the two rings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">What ring gave you my lord?<br>
Not that, I hope, which you received of me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">If I could add a lie unto a fault,<br>
I would deny it; but you see my finger<br>
Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Even so void is your false heart of truth.<br>
By heaven, I will ne&#8217;er come in your bed<br>
Until I see the ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I in yours<br>
Till I again see mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Portia,<br>
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,<br>
If you did know for whom I gave the ring<br>
And would conceive for what I gave the ring<br>
And how unwillingly I left the ring,<br>
When nought would be accepted but the ring,<br>
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">If you had known the virtue of the ring,<br>
Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,<br>
Or your own honour to contain the ring,<br>
You would not then have parted with the ring.<br>
What man is there so much unreasonable,<br>
If you had pleased to have defended it<br>
With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty<br>
To urge the thing held as a ceremony?<br>
Nerissa teaches me what to believe:<br>
I&#8217;ll die for&#8217;t but some woman had the ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,<br>
No woman had it, but a civil doctor,<br>
Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me<br>
And begg&#8217;d the ring; the which I did deny him<br>
And suffer&#8217;d him to go displeased away;<br>
Even he that did uphold the very life<br>
Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?<br>
I was enforced to send it after him;<br>
I was beset with shame and courtesy;<br>
My honour would not let ingratitude<br>
So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;<br>
For, by these blessed candles of the night,<br>
Had you been there, I think you would have begg&#8217;d<br>
The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Let not that doctor e&#8217;er come near my
house:<br>
Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,<br>
And that which you did swear to keep for me,<br>
I will become as liberal as you;<br>
I&#8217;ll not deny him any thing I have,<br>
No, not my body nor my husband&#8217;s bed:<br>
Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:<br>
Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:<br>
If you do not, if I be left alone,<br>
Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,<br>
I&#8217;ll have that doctor for my bedfellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">And I his clerk; therefore be well advised<br>
How you do leave me to mine own protection.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;<br>
For if I do, I&#8217;ll mar the young clerk&#8217;s pen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome
notwithstanding.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;<br>
And, in the hearing of these many friends,<br>
I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,<br>
Wherein I see myself&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Mark you but that!<br>
In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;<br>
In each eye, one: swear by your double self,<br>
And there&#8217;s an oath of credit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, but hear me:<br>
Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear<br>
I never more will break an oath with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I once did lend my body for his wealth;<br>
Which, but for him that had your husband&#8217;s ring,<br>
Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,<br>
My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord<br>
Will never more break faith advisedly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Then you shall be his surety. Give him this<br>
And bid him keep it better than the other.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;<br>
For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;<br>
For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor&#8217;s clerk,<br>
In lieu of this last night did lie with me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this is like the mending of highways<br>
In summer, where the ways are fair enough:<br>
What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:<br>
Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;<br>
It comes from Padua, from Bellario:<br>
There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,<br>
Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here<br>
Shall witness I set forth as soon as you<br>
And even but now return&#8217;d; I have not yet<br>
Enter&#8217;d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;<br>
And I have better news in store for you<br>
Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;<br>
There you shall find three of your argosies<br>
Are richly come to harbour suddenly:<br>
You shall not know by what strange accident<br>
I chanced on this letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">I am dumb.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Were you the doctor and I knew you not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Were you the clerk that is to make me
cuckold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,<br>
Unless he live until he be a man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bassanio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:<br>
When I am absent, then lie with my wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antonio</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet lady, you have given me life and
living;<br>
For here I read for certain that my ships<br>
Are safely come to road.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Lorenzo!<br>
My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Nerissa</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and I&#8217;ll give them him without a
fee.<br>
There do I give to you and Jessica,<br>
From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,<br>
After his death, of all he dies possess&#8217;d of.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lorenzo</p>
<p class="speech">Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way<br>
Of starved people.</p>
<p class="speaker">Portia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It is almost morning,<br>
And yet I am sure you are not satisfied<br>
Of these events at full. Let us go in;<br>
And charge us there upon inter&#8217;gatories,<br>
And we will answer all things faithfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gratiano</p>
<p class="speech">Let it be so: the first inter&#8217;gatory<br>
That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,<br>
Whether till the next night she had rather stay,<br>
Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:<br>
But were the day come, I should wish it dark,<br>
That I were couching with the doctor&#8217;s clerk.<br>
Well, while I live I&#8217;ll fear no other thing<br>
So sore as keeping safe Nerissa&#8217;s ring.</p>
