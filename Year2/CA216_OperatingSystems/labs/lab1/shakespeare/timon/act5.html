<h4>Scene I. The woods. Before Timon&#8217;s cave.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Poet and Painter; Timon
watching them from his cave</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">As I took note of the place, it cannot be far
where
he abides.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s to be thought of him? does the
rumour hold
for true, that he&#8217;s so full of gold?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
straggling soldiers with great quantity: &#8217;tis said
he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Then this breaking of his has been but a try for
his friends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in
Athens
again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
&#8217;tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
what they travail for, if it be a just true report
that goes of his having.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">What have you now to present unto him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I
will
promise him an excellent piece.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I must serve him so too, tell him of an
intent
that&#8217;s coming toward him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Good as the best. Promising is the very air
o&#8217; the
time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
of will or testament which argues a great sickness
in his judgment that makes it.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Timon comes from his cave,
behind</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Excellent
workman! thou canst not paint a
man so bad as is thyself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">I am thinking what I shall say I have provided
for
him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Must thou
needs stand for a villain in
thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, let&#8217;s seek him:<br>
Then do we sin against our own estate,<br>
When we may profit meet, and come too late.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">True;<br>
When the day serves, before black-corner&#8217;d night,<br>
Find what thou want&#8217;st by free and offer&#8217;d light.
Come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> I&#8217;ll
meet you at the turn. What a
god&#8217;s gold,<br>
That he is worshipp&#8217;d in a baser temple<br>
Than where swine feed!<br>
&#8217;Tis thou that rigg&#8217;st the bark and plough&#8217;st the
foam,<br>
Settlest admired reverence in a slave:<br>
To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye<br>
Be crown&#8217;d with plagues that thee alone obey!<br>
Fit I meet them.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Coming forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, worthy Timon!</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">Our late noble master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Have I once lived to see two honest men?</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
Having often of your open bounty tasted,<br>
Hearing you were retired, your friends fall&#8217;n off,<br>
Whose thankless natures&#8212;O abhorred spirits!&#8212;<br>
Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:<br>
What! to you,<br>
Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence<br>
To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover<br>
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude<br>
With any size of words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Let it go naked, men may see&#8217;t the
better:<br>
You that are honest, by being what you are,<br>
Make them best seen and known.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">He and myself<br>
Have travail&#8217;d in the great shower of your gifts,<br>
And sweetly felt it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, you are honest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">We are hither come to offer you our service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite
you?<br>
Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">What we can do, we&#8217;ll do, to do you
service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ye&#8217;re honest men: ye&#8217;ve heard that I
have gold;<br>
I am sure you have: speak truth; ye&#8217;re honest men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore<br>
Came not my friend nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Good honest men! Thou draw&#8217;st a
counterfeit<br>
Best in all Athens: thou&#8217;rt, indeed, the best;<br>
Thou counterfeit&#8217;st most lively.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">So, so, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">E&#8217;en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy
fiction,<br>
Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth<br>
That thou art even natural in thine art.<br>
But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,<br>
I must needs say you have a little fault:<br>
Marry, &#8217;tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I<br>
You take much pains to mend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Beseech your honour<br>
To make it known to us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll take it ill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Most thankfully, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Will you, indeed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Doubt it not, worthy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s never a one of you but trusts a
knave,<br>
That mightily deceives you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Do we, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,<br>
Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,<br>
Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured<br>
That he&#8217;s a made-up villain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Painter</p>
<p class="speech">I know none such, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Poet</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Look you, I love you well; I&#8217;ll give you
gold,<br>
Rid me these villains from your companies:<br>
Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,<br>
Confound them by some course, and come to me,<br>
I&#8217;ll give you gold enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">Name them, my lord, let&#8217;s know them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You that way and you this, but two in
company;<br>
Each man apart, all single and alone,<br>
Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.<br>
If where thou art two villains shall not be,<br>
Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside<br>
But where one villain is, then him abandon.<br>
Hence, pack! there&#8217;s gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Painter</span></p>
<p class="speech">You have work&#8217;d for me; there&#8217;s
payment for you: hence!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Poet</span></p>
<p class="speech">You are an alchemist; make gold of that.<br>
Out, rascal dogs!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Beats them out, and then
retires to his cave</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Flavius and two
Senators</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">It is in vain that you would speak with
Timon;<br>
For he is set so only to himself<br>
That nothing but himself which looks like man<br>
Is friendly with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Bring us to his cave:<br>
It is our part and promise to the Athenians<br>
To speak with Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">At all times alike<br>
Men are not still the same: &#8217;twas time and griefs<br>
That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,<br>
Offering the fortunes of his former days,<br>
The former man may make him. Bring us to him,<br>
And chance it as it may.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Here is his cave.<br>
Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!<br>
Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,<br>
By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:<br>
Speak to them, noble Timon.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Timon comes from his
cave</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Thou sun, that comfort&#8217;st, burn! Speak,
and
be hang&#8217;d:<br>
For each true word, a blister! and each false<br>
Be as cauterizing to the root o&#8217; the tongue,<br>
Consuming it with speaking!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Worthy Timon,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I thank them; and would send them back the
plague,<br>
Could I but catch it for them.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">O, forget<br>
What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.<br>
The senators with one consent of love<br>
Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought<br>
On special dignities, which vacant lie<br>
For thy best use and wearing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">They confess<br>
Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:<br>
Which now the public body, which doth seldom<br>
Play the recanter, feeling in itself<br>
A lack of Timon&#8217;s aid, hath sense withal<br>
Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;<br>
And send forth us, to make their sorrow&#8217;d render,<br>
Together with a recompense more fruitful<br>
Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;<br>
Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth<br>
As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs<br>
And write in thee the figures of their love,<br>
Ever to read them thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">You witch me in it;<br>
Surprise me to the very brink of tears:<br>
Lend me a fool&#8217;s heart and a woman&#8217;s eyes,<br>
And I&#8217;ll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, so please thee to return with us<br>
And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take<br>
The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,<br>
Allow&#8217;d with absolute power and thy good name<br>
Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back<br>
Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,<br>
Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up<br>
His country&#8217;s peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">And shakes his threatening sword<br>
Against the walls of Athens.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, Timon,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir;
thus:<br>
If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,<br>
Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,<br>
That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,<br>
And take our goodly aged men by the beards,<br>
Giving our holy virgins to the stain<br>
Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain&#8217;d war,<br>
Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,<br>
In pity of our aged and our youth,<br>
I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,<br>
And let him take&#8217;t at worst; for their knives care not,<br>
While you have throats to answer: for myself,<br>
There&#8217;s not a whittle in the unruly camp<br>
But I do prize it at my love before<br>
The reverend&#8217;st throat in Athens. So I leave you<br>
To the protection of the prosperous gods,<br>
As thieves to keepers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Stay not, all&#8217;s in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I was writing of my epitaph;<br>
It will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness<br>
Of health and living now begins to mend,<br>
And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;<br>
Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,<br>
And last so long enough!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">We speak in vain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">But yet I love my country, and am not<br>
One that rejoices in the common wreck,<br>
As common bruit doth put it.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s well spoke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to my loving countrymen,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">These words become your lips as they pass
thorough them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">And enter in our ears like great triumphers<br>
In their applauding gates.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Commend me to them,<br>
And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,<br>
Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,<br>
Their pangs of love, with other incident throes<br>
That nature&#8217;s fragile vessel doth sustain<br>
In life&#8217;s uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:<br>
I&#8217;ll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades&#8217; wrath.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">I like this well; he will return again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">I have a tree, which grows here in my close,<br>
That mine own use invites me to cut down,<br>
And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,<br>
Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree<br>
From high to low throughout, that whoso please<br>
To stop affliction, let him take his haste,<br>
Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,<br>
And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flavius</p>
<p class="speech">Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Timon</p>
<p class="speech">Come not to me again: but say to Athens,<br>
Timon hath made his everlasting mansion<br>
Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;<br>
Who once a day with his embossed froth<br>
The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,<br>
And let my grave-stone be your oracle.<br>
Lips, let sour words go by and language end:<br>
What is amiss plague and infection mend!<br>
Graves only be men&#8217;s works and death their gain!<br>
Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Retires to his
cave</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">His discontents are unremoveably<br>
Coupled to nature.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Our hope in him is dead: let us return,<br>
And strain what other means is left unto us<br>
In our dear peril.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It requires swift foot.</p>

Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast painfully discover&#8217;d: are his

Besides, his expedition promises<br>

<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;<br>
Whom, though in general part we were opposed,<br>
Yet our old love made a particular force,<br>
And made us speak like friends: this man was riding<br>
From Alcibiades to Timon&#8217;s cave,<br>
With letters of entreaty, which imported<br>
His fellowship i&#8217; the cause against your city,<br>

Dead, sure; and this his grave. What&#8217;s on this tomb<br>

<p class="speech">Till now you have gone on and fill&#8217;d the

With all licentious measure, making your wills<br>
The scope of justice; till now myself and such<br>
As slept within the shadow of your power<br>
Hav e wander&#8217;d with our traversed arms and breathed<br>
Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,<br>
When crouching marrow in the bearer strong<br>
Cries of itself &#8216;No more:&#8217; now breathless wrong<br>
Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,<br>
And pursy insolence shall break his wind<br>
With fear and horrid flight.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Noble and young,<br>
When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,<br>
Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,<br>
We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,<br>
To wipe out our ingratitude with loves<br>
Above their quantity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">So did we woo<br>
Transformed Timon to our city&#8217;s love<br>
By humble message and by promised means:<br>
We were not all unkind, nor all deserve<br>
The common stroke of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">These walls of ours<br>
Were not erected by their hands from whom<br>
You have received your griefs; nor are they such<br>
That these great towers, trophies and schools
should fall<br>
For private faults in them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Nor are they living<br>
Who were the motives that you first went out;<br>
Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess<br>
Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,<br>
Into our city with thy banners spread:<br>
By decimation, and a tithed death&#8212;<br>
If thy revenges hunger for that food<br>
Which nature loathes&#8212;take thou the destined tenth,<br>
And by the hazard of the spotted die<br>
Let die the spotted.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">All have not offended;<br>
For those that were, it is not square to take<br>
On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,<br>
Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,<br>
Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:<br>
Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin<br>
Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall<br>
With those that have offended: like a shepherd,<br>
Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,<br>
But kill not all together.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">What thou wilt,<br>
Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile<br>
Than hew to&#8217;t with thy sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Set but thy foot<br>
Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;<br>
So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,<br>
To say thou&#8217;lt enter friendly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Senator</p>
<p class="speech">Throw thy glove,<br>
Or any token of thine honour else,<br>
That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress<br>
And not as our confusion, all thy powers<br>
Shall make their harbour in our town, till we<br>
Have seal&#8217;d thy full desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Then there&#8217;s my glove;<br>
Descend, and open your uncharged ports:<br>
Those enemies of Timon&#8217;s and mine own<br>
Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof<br>
Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears<br>
With my more noble meaning, not a man<br>
Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream<br>
Of regular justice in your city&#8217;s bounds,<br>
But shall be render&#8217;d to your public laws<br>
At heaviest answer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Both</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis most nobly spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech">Descend, and keep your words.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Senators descend, and
open the gates</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Soldier</p>
<p class="speech">My noble general, Timon is dead;<br>
Entomb&#8217;d upon the very hem o&#8217; the sea;<br>
And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which<br>
With wax I brought away, whose soft impression<br>
Interprets for my poor ignorance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Alcibiades</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads the epitaph]</span>
&#8216;Here lies a
wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:<br>
Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
caitiffs left!<br>
Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:<br>
Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
not here thy gait.&#8217;<br>
These well express in thee thy latter spirits:<br>
Though thou abhorr&#8217;dst in us our human griefs,<br>
Scorn&#8217;dst our brain&#8217;s flow and those our
droplets which<br>
From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit<br>
Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye<br>
On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead<br>
Is noble Timon: of whose memory<br>
Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,<br>
And I will use the olive with my sword,<br>
Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each<br>
Prescribe to other as each other&#8217;s leech.<br>
Let our drums strike.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
