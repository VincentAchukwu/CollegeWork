<h3>ACT I</h3>
<div id="act1.1" class="scene" title=
"Act I Scene I. Athens. The palace of Theseus.">
<h4>Scene I. Athens. The palace of Theseus.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Theseus, Hippolyta,
Philostrate, and Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour<br>
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in<br>
Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow<br>
This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,<br>
Like to a step-dame or a dowager<br>
Long withering out a young man&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Four days will quickly steep themselves in
night;<br>
Four nights will quickly dream away the time;<br>
And then the moon, like to a silver bow<br>
New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night<br>
Of our solemnities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, Philostrate,<br>
Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;<br>
Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;<br>
Turn melancholy forth to funerals;<br>
The pale companion is not for our pomp.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Philostrate</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hippolyta, I woo&#8217;d thee with my sword,<br>
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;<br>
But I will wed thee in another key,<br>
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Egeus, Hermia,
Lysander, and Demetrius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, good Egeus: what&#8217;s the news with
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Full of vexation come I, with complaint<br>
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.<br>
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,<br>
This man hath my consent to marry her.<br>
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,<br>
This man hath bewitch&#8217;d the bosom of my child;<br>
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,<br>
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:<br>
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,<br>
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,<br>
And stolen the impression of her fantasy<br>
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,<br>
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers<br>
Of strong prevailment in unharden&#8217;d youth:<br>
With cunning hast thou filch&#8217;d my daughter&#8217;s heart,<br>
Turn&#8217;d her obedience, which is due to me,<br>
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,<br>
Be it so she will not here before your grace<br>
Consent to marry with Demetrius,<br>
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,<br>
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:<br>
Which shall be either to this gentleman<br>
Or to her death, according to our law<br>
Immediately provided in that case.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:<br>
To you your father should be as a god;<br>
One that composed your beauties, yea, and one<br>
To whom you are but as a form in wax<br>
By him imprinted and within his power<br>
To leave the figure or disfigure it.<br>
Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">So is Lysander.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In himself he is;<br>
But in this kind, wanting your father&#8217;s voice,<br>
The other must be held the worthier.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I would my father look&#8217;d but with my
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I do entreat your grace to pardon me.<br>
I know not by what power I am made bold,<br>
Nor how it may concern my modesty,<br>
In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;<br>
But I beseech your grace that I may know<br>
The worst that may befall me in this case,<br>
If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Either to die the death or to abjure<br>
For ever the society of men.<br>
Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;<br>
Know of your youth, examine well your blood,<br>
Whether, if you yield not to your father&#8217;s choice,<br>
You can endure the livery of a nun,<br>
For aye to be in shady cloister mew&#8217;d,<br>
To live a barren sister all your life,<br>
Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.<br>
Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,<br>
To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;<br>
But earthlier happy is the rose distill&#8217;d,<br>
Than that which withering on the virgin thorn<br>
Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,<br>
Ere I will yield my virgin patent up<br>
Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke<br>
My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Take time to pause; and, by the next new
moon&#8212;<br>
The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,<br>
For everlasting bond of fellowship&#8212;<br>
Upon that day either prepare to die<br>
For disobedience to your father&#8217;s will,<br>
Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;<br>
Or on Diana&#8217;s altar to protest<br>
For aye austerity and single life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield<br>
Thy crazed title to my certain right.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">You have her father&#8217;s love, Demetrius;<br>
Let me have Hermia&#8217;s: do you marry him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,<br>
And what is mine my love shall render him.<br>
And she is mine, and all my right of her<br>
I do estate unto Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">I am, my lord, as well derived as he,<br>
As well possess&#8217;d; my love is more than his;<br>
My fortunes every way as fairly rank&#8217;d,<br>
If not with vantage, as Demetrius&#8217;;<br>
And, which is more than all these boasts can be,<br>
I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:<br>
Why should not I then prosecute my right?<br>
Demetrius, I&#8217;ll avouch it to his head,<br>
Made love to Nedar&#8217;s daughter, Helena,<br>
And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,<br>
Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,<br>
Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">I must confess that I have heard so much,<br>
And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;<br>
But, being over-full of self-affairs,<br>
My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;<br>
And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,<br>
I have some private schooling for you both.<br>
For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself<br>
To fit your fancies to your father&#8217;s will;<br>
Or else the law of Athens yields you up&#8212;<br>
Which by no means we may extenuate&#8212;<br>
To death, or to a vow of single life.<br>
Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?<br>
Demetrius and Egeus, go along:<br>
I must employ you in some business<br>
Against our nuptial and confer with you<br>
Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">With duty and desire we follow you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Lysander and
Hermia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?<br>
How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Belike for want of rain, which I could well<br>
Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,<br>
Could ever hear by tale or history,<br>
The course of true love never did run smooth;<br>
But, either it was different in blood,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O cross! too high to be enthrall&#8217;d to
low.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or else misgraffed in respect of
years,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O spite! too old to be engaged to young.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or else it stood upon the choice of
friends,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O hell! to choose love by another&#8217;s
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,<br>
War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,<br>
Making it momentary as a sound,<br>
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;<br>
Brief as the lightning in the collied night,<br>
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,<br>
And ere a man hath power to say &#8216;Behold!&#8217;<br>
The jaws of darkness do devour it up:<br>
So quick bright things come to confusion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">If then true lovers have been ever
cross&#8217;d,<br>
It stands as an edict in destiny:<br>
Then let us teach our trial patience,<br>
Because it is a customary cross,<br>
As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,<br>
Wishes and tears, poor fancy&#8217;s followers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">A good persuasion: therefore, hear me,
Hermia.<br>
I have a widow aunt, a dowager<br>
Of great revenue, and she hath no child:<br>
From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;<br>
And she respects me as her only son.<br>
There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;<br>
And to that place the sharp Athenian law<br>
Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,<br>
Steal forth thy father&#8217;s house to-morrow night;<br>
And in the wood, a league without the town,<br>
Where I did meet thee once with Helena,<br>
To do observance to a morn of May,<br>
There will I stay for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">My good Lysander!<br>
I swear to thee, by Cupid&#8217;s strongest bow,<br>
By his best arrow with the golden head,<br>
By the simplicity of Venus&#8217; doves,<br>
By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,<br>
And by that fire which burn&#8217;d the Carthage queen,<br>
When the false Troyan under sail was seen,<br>
By all the vows that ever men have broke,<br>
In number more than ever women spoke,<br>
In that same place thou hast appointed me,<br>
To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Helena</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">God speed fair Helena! whither away?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.<br>
Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!<br>
Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue&#8217;s sweet air<br>
More tuneable than lark to shepherd&#8217;s ear,<br>
When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.<br>
Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,<br>
Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;<br>
My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,<br>
My tongue should catch your tongue&#8217;s sweet melody.<br>
Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,<br>
The rest I&#8217;d give to be to you translated.<br>
O, teach me how you look, and with what art<br>
You sway the motion of Demetrius&#8217; heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O that your frowns would teach my smiles such
skill!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O that my prayers could such affection move!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">The more I hate, the more he follows me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">The more I love, the more he hateth me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">None, but your beauty: would that fault were
mine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;<br>
Lysander and myself will fly this place.<br>
Before the time I did Lysander see,<br>
Seem&#8217;d Athens as a paradise to me:<br>
O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,<br>
That he hath turn&#8217;d a heaven unto a hell!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:<br>
To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold<br>
Her silver visage in the watery glass,<br>
Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,<br>
A time that lovers&#8217; flights doth still conceal,<br>
Through Athens&#8217; gates have we devised to steal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">And in the wood, where often you and I<br>
Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,<br>
Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,<br>
There my Lysander and myself shall meet;<br>
And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,<br>
To seek new friends and stranger companies.<br>
Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;<br>
And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!<br>
Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight<br>
From lovers&#8217; food till morrow deep midnight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">I will, my Hermia.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Hermia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Helena, adieu:<br>
As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">How happy some o&#8217;er other some can be!<br>
Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.<br>
But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;<br>
He will not know what all but he do know:<br>
And as he errs, doting on Hermia&#8217;s eyes,<br>
So I, admiring of his qualities:<br>
Things base and vile, holding no quantity,<br>
Love can transpose to form and dignity:<br>
Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;<br>
And therefore is wing&#8217;d Cupid painted blind:<br>
Nor hath Love&#8217;s mind of any judgement taste;<br>
Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:<br>
And therefore is Love said to be a child,<br>
Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.<br>
As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,<br>
So the boy Love is perjured every where:<br>
For ere Demetrius look&#8217;d on Hermia&#8217;s eyne,<br>
He hail&#8217;d down oaths that he was only mine;<br>
And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,<br>
So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.<br>
I will go tell him of fair Hermia&#8217;s flight:<br>
Then to the wood will he to-morrow night<br>
Pursue her; and for this intelligence<br>
If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:<br>
But herein mean I to enrich my pain,<br>
To have his sight thither and back again.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Athens. Quince&#8217;s house.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Quince, Snug, Bottom,
Flute, Snout, and Starveling</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Is all our company here?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">You were best to call them generally, man by
man,
according to the scrip.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Here is the scroll of every man&#8217;s name,
which is
thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
wedding-day at night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">First, good Peter Quince, say what the play
treats
on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
to a point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy,
and
most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">A very good piece of work, I assure you, and
a
merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the
weaver.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">A lover, that kills himself most gallant for
love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">That will ask some tears in the true performing
of
it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
tear a cat in, to make all split.</p>
<p class="speech">
The raging rocks<br>
And shivering shocks<br>
Shall break the locks<br>
Of prison gates;<br>
And Phibbus&#8217; car<br>
Shall shine from far<br>
And make and mar<br>
The foolish Fates.</p>
<p class="speech">
This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
This is Ercles&#8217; vein, a tyrant&#8217;s vein; a lover is
more condoling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Flute, you must take Thisby on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">What is Thisby? a wandering knight?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">It is the lady that Pyramus must love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Flute</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a
beard coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s all one: you shall play it in a
mask, and
you may speak as small as you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too,
I&#8217;ll
speak in a monstrous little voice. &#8216;Thisne,
Thisne;&#8217; &#8216;Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
and lady dear!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you
Thisby.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Well, proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Robin Starveling, the tailor.</p>
<p class="speaker">Starveling</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby&#8217;s
mother.
Tom Snout, the tinker.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">Here, Peter Quince.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You, Pyramus&#8217; father: myself,
Thisby&#8217;s father:
Snug, the joiner; you, the lion&#8217;s part: and, I
hope, here is a play fitted.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snug</p>
<p class="speech">Have you the lion&#8217;s part written? pray you,
if it
be, give it me, for I am slow of study.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but
roaring.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I
will
do any man&#8217;s heart good to hear me; I will roar,
that I will make the duke say &#8216;Let him roar again,
let him roar again.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">An you should do it too terribly, you would
fright
the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
and that were enough to hang us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">That would hang us, every mother&#8217;s son.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">I grant you, friends, if that you should fright
the
ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
sucking dove; I will roar you an &#8217;twere any
nightingale.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is
a
sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
summer&#8217;s day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I
best
to play it in?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what you will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">I will discharge it in either your
straw-colour
beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
perfect yellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Some of your French crowns have no hair at all,
and
then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
wants. I pray you, fail me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">At the duke&#8217;s oak we meet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.</p>

Fairy, and Puck</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">How now, spirit! whither wander you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fairy</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Over hill, over dale,<br>
Thorough bush, thorough brier,<br>
Over park, over pale,<br>
Thorough flood, thorough fire,<br>
I do wander everywhere,<br>
Swifter than the moon&#8217;s sphere;<br>
And I serve the fairy queen,<br>
To dew her orbs upon the green.<br>
The cowslips tall her pensioners be:<br>
In their gold coats spots you see;<br>
Those be rubies, fairy favours,<br>
In those freckles live their savours:<br>
I must go seek some dewdrops here<br>
And hang a pearl in every cowslip&#8217;s ear.<br>
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I&#8217;ll be gone:<br>
Our queen and all our elves come here anon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">The king doth keep his revels here to-night:<br>
Take heed the queen come not within his sight;<br>
For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,<br>
Because that she as her attendant hath<br>
A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;<br>
She never had so sweet a changeling;<br>
And jealous Oberon would have the child<br>
Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;<br>
But she perforce withholds the loved boy,<br>
Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:<br>
And now they never meet in grove or green,<br>
By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,<br>
But, they do square, that all their elves for fear<br>
Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fairy</p>
<p class="speech">Either I mistake your shape and making quite,<br>
Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite<br>
Call&#8217;d Robin Goodfellow: are not you he<br>
That frights the maidens of the villagery;<br>
Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern<br>
And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;<br>
And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;<br>
Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?<br>
Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,<br>
You do their work, and they shall have good luck:<br>
Are not you he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Thou speak&#8217;st aright;<br>
I am that merry wanderer of the night.<br>
I jest to Oberon and make him smile<br>
When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,<br>
Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:<br>
And sometime lurk I in a gossip&#8217;s bowl,<br>
In very likeness of a roasted crab,<br>
And when she drinks, against her lips I bob<br>
And on her wither&#8217;d dewlap pour the ale.<br>
The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,<br>
Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;<br>
Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,<br>
And &#8216;tailor&#8217; cries, and falls into a cough;<br>
And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,<br>
And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear<br>
A merrier hour was never wasted there.<br>
But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fairy</p>
<p class="speech">And here my mistress. Would that he were
gone!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, from one side, Oberon,
with his train; from the other, Titania, with hers</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:<br>
I have forsworn his bed and company.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">Then I must be thy lady: but I know<br>
When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,<br>
And in the shape of Corin sat all day,<br>
Playing on pipes of corn and versing love<br>
To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,<br>
Come from the farthest Steppe of India?<br>
But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,<br>
Your buskin&#8217;d mistress and your warrior love,<br>
To Theseus must be wedded, and you come<br>
To give their bed joy and prosperity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,<br>
Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,<br>
Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?<br>
Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night<br>
From Perigenia, whom he ravished?<br>
And make him with fair Aegle break his faith,<br>
With Ariadne and Antiopa?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">These are the forgeries of jealousy:<br>
And never, since the middle summer&#8217;s spring,<br>
Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,<br>
By paved fountain or by rushy brook,<br>
Or in the beached margent of the sea,<br>
To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,<br>
But with thy brawls thou hast disturb&#8217;d our sport.<br>
Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,<br>
As in revenge, have suck&#8217;d up from the sea<br>
Contagious fogs; which falling in the land<br>
Have every pelting river made so proud<br>
That they have overborne their continents:<br>
The ox hath therefore stretch&#8217;d his yoke in vain,<br>
The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn<br>
Hath rotted ere his youth attain&#8217;d a beard;<br>
The fold stands empty in the drowned field,<br>
And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;<br>
The nine men&#8217;s morris is fill&#8217;d up with mud,<br>
And the quaint mazes in the wanton green<br>
For lack of tread are undistinguishable:<br>
The human mortals want their winter here;<br>
No night is now with hymn or carol blest:<br>
Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,<br>
Pale in her anger, washes all the air,<br>
That rheumatic diseases do abound:<br>
And thorough this distemperature we see<br>
The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts<br>
Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,<br>
And on old Hiems&#8217; thin and icy crown<br>
An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds<br>
Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,<br>
The childing autumn, angry winter, change<br>
Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,<br>
By their increase, now knows not which is which:<br>
And this same progeny of evils comes<br>
From our debate, from our dissension;<br>
We are their parents and original.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Do you amend it then; it lies in you:<br>
Why should Titania cross her Oberon?<br>
I do but beg a little changeling boy,<br>
To be my henchman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Set your heart at rest:<br>
The fairy land buys not the child of me.<br>
His mother was a votaress of my order:<br>
And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,<br>
Full often hath she gossip&#8217;d by my side,<br>
And sat with me on Neptune&#8217;s yellow sands,<br>
Marking the embarked traders on the flood,<br>
When we have laugh&#8217;d to see the sails conceive<br>
And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;<br>
Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait<br>
Following,&#8212;her womb then rich with my young
squire,&#8212;<br>
Would imitate, and sail upon the land,<br>
To fetch me trifles, and return again,<br>
As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.<br>
But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;<br>
And for her sake do I rear up her boy,<br>
And for her sake I will not part with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">How long within this wood intend you stay?</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance till after Theseus&#8217;
wedding-day.<br>
If you will patiently dance in our round<br>
And see our moonlight revels, go with us;<br>
If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Titania</p>
<p class="speech">Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!<br>
We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Titania with her
train</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this
grove<br>
Till I torment thee for this injury.<br>
My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest<br>
Since once I sat upon a promontory,<br>
And heard a mermaid on a dolphin&#8217;s back<br>
Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath<br>
That the rude sea grew civil at her song<br>
And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,<br>
To hear the sea-maid&#8217;s music.</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">I remember.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,<br>
Flying between the cold moon and the earth,<br>
Cupid all arm&#8217;d: a certain aim he took<br>
At a fair vestal throned by the west,<br>
And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,<br>
As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;<br>
But I might see young Cupid&#8217;s fiery shaft<br>
Quench&#8217;d in the chaste beams of the watery moon,<br>
And the imperial votaress passed on,<br>
In maiden meditation, fancy-free.<br>
Yet mark&#8217;d I where the bolt of Cupid fell:<br>
It fell upon a little western flower,<br>
Before milk-white, now purple with love&#8217;s wound,<br>
And maidens call it love-in-idleness.<br>
Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew&#8217;d thee once:<br>
The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid<br>
Will make or man or woman madly dote<br>
Upon the next live creature that it sees.<br>
Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again<br>
Ere the leviathan can swim a league.</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll put a girdle round about the earth<br>
In forty minutes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Having once this juice,<br>
I&#8217;ll watch Titania when she is asleep,<br>
And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.<br>
The next thing then she waking looks upon,<br>
Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,<br>
On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,<br>
She shall pursue it with the soul of love:<br>
And ere I take this charm from off her sight,<br>
As I can take it with another herb,<br>
I&#8217;ll make her render up her page to me.<br>
But who comes here? I am invisible;<br>
And I will overhear their conference.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Demetrius, Helena,
following him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.<br>
Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?<br>
The one I&#8217;ll slay, the other slayeth me.<br>
Thou told&#8217;st me they were stolen unto this wood;<br>
And here am I, and wode within this wood,<br>
Because I cannot meet my Hermia.<br>
Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;<br>
But yet you draw not iron, for my heart<br>
Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,<br>
And I shall have no power to follow you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?<br>
Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth<br>
Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">And even for that do I love you the more.<br>
I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,<br>
The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:<br>
Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,<br>
Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,<br>
Unworthy as I am, to follow you.<br>
What worser place can I beg in your love,&#8212;<br>
And yet a place of high respect with me,&#8212;<br>
Than to be used as you use your dog?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;<br>
For I am sick when I do look on thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">And I am sick when I look not on you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">You do impeach your modesty too much,<br>
To leave the city and commit yourself<br>
Into the hands of one that loves you not;<br>
To trust the opportunity of night<br>
And the ill counsel of a desert place<br>
With the rich worth of your virginity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Your virtue is my privilege: for that<br>
It is not night when I do see your face,<br>
Therefore I think I am not in the night;<br>
Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,<br>
For you in my respect are all the world:<br>
Then how can it be said I am alone,<br>
When all the world is here to look on me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll run from thee and hide me in the
brakes,<br>
And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">The wildest hath not such a heart as you.<br>
Run when you will, the story shall be changed:<br>
Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;<br>
The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind<br>
Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,<br>
When cowardice pursues and valour flies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I will not stay thy questions; let me go:<br>
Or, if thou follow me, do not believe<br>
But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,<br>
You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!<br>
Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:<br>
We cannot fight for love, as men may do;<br>
We should be woo&#8217;d and were not made to woo.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Demetrius</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll follow thee and make a heaven of
hell,<br>
To die upon the hand I love so well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this

<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, there it is.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, give it me.<br>
I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,<br>
Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,<br>
Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,<br>
With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:<br>
There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,<br>
Lull&#8217;d in these flowers with dances and delight;<br>
And there the snake throws her enamell&#8217;d skin,<br>
Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:<br>
And with the juice of this I&#8217;ll streak her eyes,<br>
And make her full of hateful fantasies.<br>
Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:<br>
A sweet Athenian lady is in love<br>
With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;<br>
But do it when the next thing he espies<br>
May be the lady: thou shalt know the man<br>
By the Athenian garments he hath on.<br>
Effect it with some care, that he may prove<br>
More fond on her than she upon her love:<br>
And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.</p>

<p class="speech">O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!<br>
The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.<br>
Happy is Hermia, wheresoe&#8217;er she lies;<br>
For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.<br>
How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:<br>
If so, my eyes are oftener wash&#8217;d than hers.<br>
No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;<br>
For beasts that meet me run away for fear:<br>
Therefore no marvel though Demetrius<br>
Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.<br>
What wicked and dissembling glass of mine<br>
Made me compare with Hermia&#8217;s sphery eyne?<br>
But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!<br>
Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.<br>
Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Awaking]</span> And run
through fire I will for thy sweet sake.<br>
Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,<br>
That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.<br>
Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word<br>
Is that vile name to perish on my sword!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Do not say so, Lysander; say not so<br>
What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?<br>
Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Content with Hermia! No; I do repent<br>
The tedious minutes I with her have spent.<br>
Not Hermia but Helena I love:<br>
Who will not change a raven for a dove?<br>
The will of man is by his reason sway&#8217;d;<br>
And reason says you are the worthier maid.<br>
Things growing are not ripe until their season<br>
So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;<br>
And touching now the point of human skill,<br>
Reason becomes the marshal to my will<br>
And leads me to your eyes, where I o&#8217;erlook<br>
Love&#8217;s stories written in love&#8217;s richest book.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?<br>
When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?<br>
Is&#8217;t not enough, is&#8217;t not enough, young man,<br>
That I did never, no, nor never can,<br>
Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius&#8217; eye,<br>
But you must flout my insufficiency?<br>
Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,<br>
In such disdainful manner me to woo.<br>
But fare you well: perforce I must confess<br>
I thought you lord of more true gentleness.<br>
O, that a lady, of one man refused.<br>
Should of another therefore be abused!</p>

And never mayst thou come Lysander near!<br>
For as a surfeit of the sweetest things<br>
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,<br>
Or as the heresies that men do leave<br>
Are hated most of those they did deceive,<br>
So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,<br>
Of all be hated, but the most of me!<br>
And, all my powers, address your love and might<br>
To honour Helen and to be her knight!</p>

And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.<br>
Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!<br>

Flute, Snout, and Starveling</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Are we all met?</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Pat, pat; and here&#8217;s a marvellous
convenient place
for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Peter Quince,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">What sayest thou, bully Bottom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">There are things in this comedy of Pyramus
and
Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
cannot abide. How answer you that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">By&#8217;r lakin, a parlous fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Starveling</p>
<p class="speech">I believe we must leave the killing out, when all
is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
out of fear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall
be
written in eight and six.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">No, make it two more; let it be written in eight
and eight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?</p>
<p class="speaker">Starveling</p>
<p class="speech">I fear it, I promise you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves:
to
bring in&#8212;God shield us!&#8212;a lion among ladies, is a
most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
look to &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a
lion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, you must name his name, and half his face
must
be seen through the lion&#8217;s neck: and he himself
must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
defect,&#8212;&#8216;Ladies,&#8217;&#8212;or
&#8216;Fair-ladies&#8212;I would wish
you,&#8217;&#8212;or &#8216;I would request you,&#8217;&#8212;or
&#8216;I would
entreat you,&#8212;not to fear, not to tremble: my life
for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
man as other men are;&#8217; and there indeed let him name
his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Well it shall be so. But there is two hard
things;
that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">Doth the moon shine that night we play our
play?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac;
find
out moonshine, find out moonshine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, it doth shine that night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then may you leave a casement of the
great
chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
may shine in at the casement.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of
thorns
and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
another thing: we must have a wall in the great
chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
talk through the chink of a wall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Snout</p>
<p class="speech">You can never bring in a wall. What say you,
Bottom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech">Some man or other must present Wall: and let
him
have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
and Thisby whisper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Quince</p>
<p class="speech">If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit
down,
every mother&#8217;s son, and rehearse your parts.
Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
according to his cue.</p>

Near to her close and consecrated bower,<br>
While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,<br>
A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,<br>
That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,<br>
Were met together to rehearse a play<br>
Intended for great Theseus&#8217; nuptial-day.<br>
The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,<br>
Who Pyramus presented, in their sport<br>
Forsook his scene and enter&#8217;d in a brake<br>
When I did him at this advantage take,<br>

Anon his Thisbe must be answered,<br>
And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,<br>
As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,<br>
Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,<br>
Rising and cawing at the gun&#8217;s report,<br>
Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,<br>
So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;<br>
And, at our stamp, here o&#8217;er and o&#8217;er one falls;<br>
He murder cries and help from Athens calls.<br>
Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
thus strong,<br>
Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;<br>
For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;<br>
Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
things catch.<br>
I led them on in this distracted fear,<br>

And kill me too.<br>
The sun was not so true unto the day<br>
As he to me: would he have stolen away<br>
From sleeping Hermia? I&#8217;ll believe as soon<br>
This whole earth may be bored and that the moon<br>
May through the centre creep and so displease<br>
Her brother&#8217;s noontide with Antipodes.<br>

Some true love turn&#8217;d and not a false turn&#8217;d true.</p>

Helena is here at hand;<br>

Shall we their fond pageant see?<br>
Lord, what fools these mortals be!</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lysander and
Helena</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Why should you think that I should woo in
scorn?<br>
Scorn and derision never come in tears:<br>
Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,<br>
In their nativity all truth appears.<br>
How can these things in me seem scorn to you,<br>
Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">You do advance your cunning more and more.<br>
When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!<br>
These vows are Hermia&#8217;s: will you give her o&#8217;er?<br>
Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:<br>
Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,<br>
Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">I had no judgment when to her I swore.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Nor none, in my mind, now you give her
o&#8217;er.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Awaking]</span> O Helena,
goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!<br>
To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?<br>
Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show<br>
Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!<br>
That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,<br>
Fann&#8217;d with the eastern wind, turns to a crow<br>
When thou hold&#8217;st up thy hand: O, let me kiss<br>
This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent<br>
To set against me for your merriment:<br>
If you were civil and knew courtesy,<br>
You would not do me thus much injury.<br>
Can you not hate me, as I know you do,<br>
But you must join in souls to mock me too?<br>
If you were men, as men you are in show,<br>
You would not use a gentle lady so;<br>
To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,<br>
When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.<br>
You both are rivals, and love Hermia;<br>
And now both rivals, to mock Helena:<br>
A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,<br>
To conjure tears up in a poor maid&#8217;s eyes<br>
With your derision! none of noble sort<br>
Would so offend a virgin, and extort<br>
A poor soul&#8217;s patience, all to make you sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;<br>
For you love Hermia; this you know I know:<br>
And here, with all good will, with all my heart,<br>
In Hermia&#8217;s love I yield you up my part;<br>
And yours of Helena to me bequeath,<br>
Whom I do love and will do till my death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Never did mockers waste more idle breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:<br>
If e&#8217;er I loved her, all that love is gone.<br>
My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn&#8217;d,<br>
And now to Helen is it home return&#8217;d,<br>

<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Dark night, that from the eye his function
takes,<br>
The ear more quick of apprehension makes;<br>
Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,<br>
It pays the hearing double recompense.<br>
Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;<br>
Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound<br>
But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Why should he stay, whom love doth press to
go?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">What love could press Lysander from my side?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Lysander&#8217;s love, that would not let him
bide,<br>
Fair Helena, who more engilds the night<br>
Than all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.<br>
Why seek&#8217;st thou me? could not this make thee know,<br>
The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">You speak not as you think: it cannot be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Lo, she is one of this confederacy!<br>
Now I perceive they have conjoin&#8217;d all three<br>
To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.<br>
Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!<br>
Have you conspired, have you with these contrived<br>
To bait me with this foul derision?<br>
Is all the counsel that we two have shared,<br>
The sisters&#8217; vows, the hours that we have spent,<br>
When we have chid the hasty-footed time<br>
For parting us,&#8212;O, is it all forgot?<br>
All school-days&#8217; friendship, childhood innocence?<br>
We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,<br>
Have with our needles created both one flower,<br>
Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,<br>
Both warbling of one song, both in one key,<br>
As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,<br>
Had been incorporate. So we grow together,<br>
Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,<br>
But yet an union in partition;<br>
Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;<br>
So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;<br>
Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,<br>
Due but to one and crowned with one crest.<br>
And will you rent our ancient love asunder,<br>
To join with men in scorning your poor friend?<br>
It is not friendly, &#8217;tis not maidenly:<br>
Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,<br>
Though I alone do feel the injury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I am amazed at your passionate words.<br>
I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,<br>
To follow me and praise my eyes and face?<br>
And made your other love, Demetrius,<br>
Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,<br>
To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,<br>
Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this<br>
To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander<br>
Deny your love, so rich within his soul,<br>
And tender me, forsooth, affection,<br>
But by your setting on, by your consent?<br>
What though I be not so in grace as you,<br>
So hung upon with love, so fortunate,<br>
But miserable most, to love unloved?<br>
This you should pity rather than despise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">I understand not what you mean by this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,<br>
Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;<br>
Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:<br>
This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.<br>
If you have any pity, grace, or manners,<br>
You would not make me such an argument.<br>
But fare ye well: &#8217;tis partly my own fault;<br>
Which death or absence soon shall remedy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:<br>
My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O excellent!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Sweet, do not scorn her so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">If she cannot entreat, I can compel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:<br>
Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.<br>
Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:<br>
I swear by that which I will lose for thee,<br>
To prove him false that says I love thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I say I love thee more than he can do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Quick, come!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Lysander, whereto tends all this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Away, you Ethiope!</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No, no; he&#8217;ll<br>
Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,<br>
But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let
loose,<br>
Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Why are you grown so rude? what change is
this?<br>
Sweet love,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!<br>
Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Do you not jest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sooth; and so do you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">I would I had your bond, for I perceive<br>
A weak bond holds you: I&#8217;ll not trust your word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her
dead?<br>
Although I hate her, I&#8217;ll not harm her so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">What, can you do me greater harm than hate?<br>
Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!<br>
Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?<br>
I am as fair now as I was erewhile.<br>
Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
me:<br>
Why, then you left me&#8212;O, the gods forbid!&#8212;<br>
In earnest, shall I say?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, by my life;<br>
And never did desire to see thee more.<br>
Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;<br>
Be certain, nothing truer; &#8217;tis no jest<br>
That I do hate thee and love Helena.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!<br>
You thief of love! what, have you come by night<br>
And stolen my love&#8217;s heart from him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Fine, i&#8217;faith!<br>
Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,<br>
No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear<br>
Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?<br>
Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.<br>
Now I perceive that she hath made compare<br>
Between our statures; she hath urged her height;<br>
And with her personage, her tall personage,<br>
Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail&#8217;d with him.<br>
And are you grown so high in his esteem;<br>
Because I am so dwarfish and so low?<br>
How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;<br>
How low am I? I am not yet so low<br>
But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,<br>
Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;<br>
I have no gift at all in shrewishness;<br>
I am a right maid for my cowardice:<br>
Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,<br>
Because she is something lower than myself,<br>
That I can match her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Lower! hark, again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.<br>
I evermore did love you, Hermia,<br>
Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong&#8217;d you;<br>
Save that, in love unto Demetrius,<br>
I told him of your stealth unto this wood.<br>
He follow&#8217;d you; for love I follow&#8217;d him;<br>
But he hath chid me hence and threaten&#8217;d me<br>
To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:<br>
And now, so you will let me quiet go,<br>
To Athens will I bear my folly back<br>
And follow you no further: let me go:<br>
You see how simple and how fond I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, get you gone: who is&#8217;t that hinders
you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">What, with Lysander?</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">With Demetrius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee,
Helena.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">No, sir, she shall not, though you take her
part.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">O, when she&#8217;s angry, she is keen and
shrewd!<br>
She was a vixen when she went to school;<br>
And though she be but little, she is fierce.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hermia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Little&#8217; again! nothing but
&#8216;low&#8217; and &#8216;little&#8217;!<br>
Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?<br>
Let me come to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Get you gone, you dwarf;<br>
You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;<br>
You bead, you acorn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">You are too officious<br>
In her behalf that scorns your services.<br>
Let her alone: speak not of Helena;<br>
Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend<br>
Never so little show of love to her,<br>
Thou shalt aby it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Now she holds me not;<br>
Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,<br>
Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Follow! nay, I&#8217;ll go with thee, cheek by
jole.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Lysander and
Demetrius</span></p>

Nay, go not back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Helena</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will not trust you, I,<br>
Nor longer stay in your curst company.<br>
Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,<br>
My legs are longer though, to run away.</p>

Or else committ&#8217;st thy knaveries wilfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.<br>
Did not you tell me I should know the man<br>
By the Athenian garment he had on?<br>
And so far blameless proves my enterprise,<br>
That I have &#8217;nointed an Athenian&#8217;s eyes;<br>
And so far am I glad it so did sort<br>
As this their jangling I esteem a sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>

fight:<br>
Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;<br>
The starry welkin cover thou anon<br>
With drooping fog as black as Acheron,<br>
And lead these testy rivals so astray<br>
As one come not within another&#8217;s way.<br>
Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,<br>
Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;<br>
And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;<br>
And from each other look thou lead them thus,<br>
Till o&#8217;er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep<br>
With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:<br>
Then crush this herb into Lysander&#8217;s eye;<br>
Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,<br>
To take from thence all error with his might,<br>
And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.<br>
When they next wake, all this derision<br>
Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,<br>
And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,<br>
With league whose date till death shall never end.<br>
Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,<br>
I&#8217;ll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;<br>
And then I will her charmed eye release<br>
From monster&#8217;s view, and all things shall be peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Puck</p>
<p class="speech">My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,<br>
For night&#8217;s swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,<br>
And yonder shines Aurora&#8217;s harbinger;<br>
At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,<br>
Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,<br>
That in crossways and floods have burial,<br>
Already to their wormy beds are gone;<br>
For fear lest day should look their shames upon,<br>
They willfully themselves exile from light<br>
And must for aye consort with black-brow&#8217;d night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oberon</p>

I with the morning&#8217;s love have oft made sport,<br>
And, like a forester, the groves may tread,<br>
Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,<br>
Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,<br>
Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.<br>

For, meeting her of late behind the wood,<br>
Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,<br>
I did upbraid her and fall out with her;<br>
For she his hairy temples then had rounded<br>
With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;<br>
And that same dew, which sometime on the buds<br>
Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,<br>
Stood now within the pretty flowerets&#8217; eyes<br>
Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.<br>
When I had at my pleasure taunted her<br>
And she in mild terms begg&#8217;d my patience,<br>
I then did ask of her her changeling child;<br>
Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent<br>
To bear him to my bower in fairy land.<br>
And now I have the boy, I will undo<br>
This hateful imperfection of her eyes:<br>
And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp<br>
From off the head of this Athenian swain;<br>
That, he awaking when the other do,<br>
May all to Athens back again repair<br>
And think no more of this night&#8217;s accidents<br>

The skies, the fountains, every region near<br>

So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>

Crook-knee&#8217;d, and dew-lapp&#8217;d like Thessalian bulls;<br>
Slow in pursuit, but match&#8217;d in mouth like bells,<br>
Each under each. A cry more tuneable<br>
Was never holla&#8217;d to, nor cheer&#8217;d with horn,<br>

How comes this gentle concord in the world,<br>
That hatred is so far from jealousy,<br>
To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I shall reply amazedly,<br>
Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,<br>
I cannot truly say how I came here;<br>
But, as I think,&#8212;for truly would I speak,<br>
And now do I bethink me, so it is,&#8212;<br>
I came with Hermia hither: our intent<br>
Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,<br>
Without the peril of the Athenian law.</p>
<p class="speaker">Egeus</p>
<p class="speech">Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:<br>
I beg the law, the law, upon his head.<br>
They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,<br>
Thereby to have defeated you and me,<br>
You of your wife and me of my consent,<br>
Of my consent that she should be your wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,<br>
Of this their purpose hither to this wood;<br>
And I in fury hither follow&#8217;d them,<br>
Fair Helena in fancy following me.<br>
But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,&#8212;<br>
But by some power it is,&#8212;my love to Hermia,<br>
Melted as the snow, seems to me now<br>
As the remembrance of an idle gaud<br>
Which in my childhood I did dote upon;<br>
And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,<br>
The object and the pleasure of mine eye,<br>
Is only Helena. To her, my lord,<br>
Was I betroth&#8217;d ere I saw Hermia:<br>
But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;<br>
But, as in health, come to my natural taste,<br>
Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,<br>
And will for evermore be true to it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:<br>
Of this discourse we more will hear anon.<br>
Egeus, I will overbear your will;<br>
For in the temple by and by with us<br>
These couples shall eternally be knit:<br>
And, for the morning now is something worn,<br>
Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.<br>
Away with us to Athens; three and three,<br>

Mine own, and not mine own.</p>

of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
seen, man&#8217;s hand is not able to taste, his tongue
to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
this dream: it shall be called Bottom&#8217;s Dream,
because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
latter end of a play, before the duke:
peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
sing it at her death.</p>

<p class="speech">He says they can do nothing in this kind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">The kinder we, to give them thanks for
nothing.<br>
Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:<br>
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect<br>
Takes it in might, not merit.<br>
Where I have come, great clerks have purposed<br>
To greet me with premeditated welcomes;<br>
Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,<br>
Make periods in the midst of sentences,<br>
Throttle their practised accent in their fears<br>
And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,<br>
Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,<br>
Out of this silence yet I pick&#8217;d a welcome;<br>
And in the modesty of fearful duty<br>
I read as much as from the rattling tongue<br>
Of saucy and audacious eloquence.<br>
Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity<br>
In least speak most, to my capacity.</p>

<p class="speech">So please your grace, the Prologue is

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Quince for the
Prologue</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prologue</p>
<p class="speech">If we offend, it is with our good will.<br>
That you should think, we come not to offend,<br>
But with good will. To show our simple skill,<br>
That is the true beginning of our end.<br>
Consider then we come but in despite.<br>
We do not come as minding to contest you,<br>
Our true intent is. All for your delight<br>
We are not here. That you should here repent you,<br>
The actors are at hand and by their show<br>
You shall know all that you are like to know.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">This fellow doth not stand upon points.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he
knows
not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
enough to speak, but to speak true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a
child
on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pyramus and Thisbe,
Wall, Moonshine, and Lion</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Prologue</p>
<p class="speech">Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;<br>
But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.<br>
This man is Pyramus, if you would know;<br>
This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.<br>
This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present<br>
Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;<br>
And through Wall&#8217;s chink, poor souls, they are content<br>
To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.<br>
This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,<br>
Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,<br>
By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn<br>
To meet at Ninus&#8217; tomb, there, there to woo.<br>
This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,<br>
The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,<br>
Did scare away, or rather did affright;<br>
And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,<br>
Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.<br>
Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,<br>
And finds his trusty Thisby&#8217;s mantle slain:<br>
Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,<br>
He bravely broach&#8217;d his boiling bloody breast;<br>
And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,<br>
His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,<br>
Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain<br>
At large discourse, while here they do remain.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe,
Lion, and Moonshine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">I wonder if the lion be to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses
do.</p>
<p class="speaker">Wall</p>
<p class="speech">In this same interlude it doth befall<br>
That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;<br>
And such a wall, as I would have you think,<br>
That had in it a crannied hole or chink,<br>
Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,<br>
Did whisper often very secretly.<br>
This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show<br>
That I am that same wall; the truth is so:<br>
And this the cranny is, right and sinister,<br>
Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Would you desire lime and hair to speak
better?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">It is the wittiest partition that ever I
heard
discourse, my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pyramus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">O grim-look&#8217;d night! O night with hue so
black!<br>
O night, which ever art when day is not!<br>
O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,<br>
I fear my Thisby&#8217;s promise is forgot!<br>
And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,<br>
That stand&#8217;st between her father&#8217;s ground and mine!<br>
Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,<br>
Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Wall holds up his
fingers</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for
this!<br>
But what see I? No Thisby do I see.<br>
O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!<br>
Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse
again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">No, in truth, sir, he should not.
&#8216;Deceiving me&#8217;
is Thisby&#8217;s cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thisbe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,<br>
For parting my fair Pyramus and me!<br>
My cherry lips have often kiss&#8217;d thy stones,<br>
Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">I see a voice: now will I to the chink,<br>
To spy an I can hear my Thisby&#8217;s face. Thisby!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">My love thou art, my love I think.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover&#8217;s
grace;<br>
And, like Limander, am I trusty still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">I kiss the wall&#8217;s hole, not your lips at
all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt thou at Ninny&#8217;s tomb meet me
straightway?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tide life, &#8217;tide death, I come
without delay.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Pyramus and
Thisbe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Wall</p>
<p class="speech">Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;<br>
And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Now is the mural down between the two
neighbours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to
hear
without warning.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">The best in this kind are but shadows; and the
worst
are no worse, if imagination amend them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">It must be your imagination then, and not
theirs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">If we imagine no worse of them than they of
themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Lion and
Moonshine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Lion</p>
<p class="speech">You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear<br>
The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,<br>
May now perchance both quake and tremble here,<br>
When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.<br>
Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am<br>
A lion-fell, nor else no lion&#8217;s dam;<br>
For, if I should as lion come in strife<br>
Into this place, &#8217;twere pity on my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">The very best at a beast, my lord, that
e&#8217;er I saw.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">This lion is a very fox for his valour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">True; and a goose for his discretion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry
his
discretion; and the fox carries the goose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his
valour;
for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moonshine</p>
<p class="speech">This lanthorn doth the horned moon
present;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">He should have worn the horns on his head.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">He is no crescent, and his horns are
invisible within the circumference.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moonshine</p>
<p class="speech">This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;<br>
Myself the man i&#8217; the moon do seem to be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">This is the greatest error of all the rest: the
man
should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
man i&#8217; the moon?</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">He dares not come there for the candle; for,
you
see, it is already in snuff.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">I am aweary of this moon: would he would
change!</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">It appears, by his small light of discretion,
that
he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
reason, we must stay the time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Proceed, Moon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Moonshine</p>
<p class="speech">All that I have to say, is, to tell you that
the
lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for
all
these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thisbe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">This is old Ninny&#8217;s tomb. Where is my
love?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Enter Lion, Roaring]</span>
<p class="speech">Oh&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Thisbe runs off]</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Well roared, Lion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Well run, Thisbe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with
a
good grace.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">The Lion shakes
Thisbe&#8217;s mantle, and exits</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Well moused, Lion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">And so the lion vanished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">And then came Pyramus.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Pyramus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;<br>
I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;<br>
For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,<br>
I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.<br>
But stay, O spite!<br>
But mark, poor knight,<br>
&emsp;What dreadful dole is here!<br>
Eyes, do you see?<br>
How can it be?<br>
&emsp;O dainty duck! O dear!<br>
Thy mantle good,<br>
What, stain&#8217;d with blood!<br>
&emsp;Approach, ye Furies fell!<br>
O Fates, come, come,<br>
Cut thread and thrum;<br>
&emsp;Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">This passion, and the death of a dear friend,
would
go near to make a man look sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Pyramus</p>
<p class="speech">O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?<br>
Since lion vile hath here deflower&#8217;d my dear:<br>
Which is&#8212;no, no&#8212;which was the fairest dame<br>
That lived, that loved, that liked, that look&#8217;d
with cheer.<br>
Come, tears, confound;<br>
Out, sword, and wound<br>
The pap of Pyramus;<br>
Ay, that left pap,<br>
Where heart doth hop:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stabs himself</span></p>
<p class="speech">Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.<br>
Now am I dead,<br>
Now am I fled;<br>
My soul is in the sky:<br>
Tongue, lose thy light;<br>
Moon take thy flight:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Moonshine</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now die, die, die, die, die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is
nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover,
and
prove an ass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe
comes
back and finds her lover?</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">She will find him by starlight. Here she comes;
and
her passion ends the play.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Thisbe</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hippolyta</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks she should not use a long one for such
a<br>
Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus,
which
Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
she for a woman, God bless us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lysander</p>
<p class="speech">She hath spied him already with those sweet
eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">And thus she means, videlicet:&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Thisbe</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Asleep, my love?<br>
What, dead, my dove?<br>
&emsp;O Pyramus, arise!<br>
Speak, speak. Quite dumb?<br>
Dead, dead? A tomb<br>
&emsp;Must cover thy sweet eyes.<br>
These lily lips,<br>
This cherry nose,<br>
&emsp;These yellow cowslip cheeks,<br>
Are gone, are gone:<br>
Lovers, make moan:<br>
&emsp;His eyes were green as leeks.<br>
O Sisters Three,<br>
Come, come to me,<br>
&emsp;With hands as pale as milk;<br>
Lay them in gore,<br>
Since you have shore<br>
&emsp;With shears his thread of silk.<br>
Tongue, not a word:<br>
Come, trusty sword;<br>
&emsp;Come, blade, my breast imbrue:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Stabs herself]</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, farewell, friends;<br>
Thus Thisby ends:<br>
&emsp;Adieu, adieu, adieu.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Dies]</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Demetrius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and Wall too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bottom</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Starting up]</span> No
assure you; the wall is down that
parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
of our company?</p>
<p class="speaker">Theseus</p>
<p class="speech">No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs
no
excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
in Thisbe&#8217;s garter, it would have been a fine
tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
epilogue alone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">A dance</span></p>
<p class="speech">The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:<br>
Lovers, to bed; &#8217;tis almost fairy time.<br>
