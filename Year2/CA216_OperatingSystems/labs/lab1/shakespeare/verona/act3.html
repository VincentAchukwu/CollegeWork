<h4>Scene I. Milan. The Duke&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke, Thurio, and
Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;<br>
We have some secrets to confer about.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, tell me, Proteus, what&#8217;s your will
with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, that which I would discover<br>
The law of friendship bids me to conceal;<br>
But when I call to mind your gracious favours<br>
Done to me, undeserving as I am,<br>
My duty pricks me on to utter that<br>
Which else no worldly good should draw from me.<br>
Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,<br>
This night intends to steal away your daughter:<br>
Myself am one made privy to the plot.<br>
I know you have determined to bestow her<br>
On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;<br>
And should she thus be stol&#8217;n away from you,<br>
It would be much vexation to your age.<br>
Thus, for my duty&#8217;s sake, I rather chose<br>
To cross my friend in his intended drift<br>
Than, by concealing it, heap on your head<br>
A pack of sorrows which would press you down,<br>
Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;<br>
Which to requite, command me while I live.<br>
This love of theirs myself have often seen,<br>
Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,<br>
And oftentimes have purposed to forbid<br>
Sir Valentine her company and my court:<br>
But fearing lest my jealous aim might err<br>
And so unworthily disgrace the man,<br>
A rashness that I ever yet have shunn&#8217;d,<br>
I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find<br>
That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.<br>
And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,<br>
Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,<br>
I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,<br>
The key whereof myself have ever kept;<br>
And thence she cannot be convey&#8217;d away.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean<br>
How he her chamber-window will ascend<br>
And with a corded ladder fetch her down;<br>
For which the youthful lover now is gone<br>
And this way comes he with it presently;<br>
Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.<br>
But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly<br>
That my discovery be not aimed at;<br>
For love of you, not hate unto my friend,<br>
Hath made me publisher of this pretence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Upon mine honour, he shall never know<br>
That I had any light from thee of this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Please it your grace, there is a messenger<br>
That stays to bear my letters to my friends,<br>
And I am going to deliver them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Be they of much import?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">The tenor of them doth but signify<br>
My health and happy being at your court.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;<br>
I am to break with thee of some affairs<br>
That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.<br>
&#8217;Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought<br>
To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match<br>
Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman<br>
Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities<br>
Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:<br>
Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen,
froward,<br>
Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,<br>
Neither regarding that she is my child<br>
Nor fearing me as if I were her father;<br>
And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,<br>
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;<br>
And, where I thought the remnant of mine age<br>
Should have been cherish&#8217;d by her child-like duty,<br>
I now am full resolved to take a wife<br>
And turn her out to who will take her in:<br>
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;<br>
For me and my possessions she esteems not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What would your Grace have me to do in this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">There is a lady in Verona here<br>
Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy<br>
And nought esteems my aged eloquence:<br>
Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor&#8212;<br>
For long agone I have forgot to court;<br>
Besides, the fashion of the time is changed&#8212;<br>
How and which way I may bestow myself<br>
To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:<br>
Dumb jewels often in their silent kind<br>
More than quick words do move a woman&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But she did scorn a present that I sent her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">A woman sometimes scorns what best contents
her.<br>
Send her another; never give her o&#8217;er;<br>
For scorn at first makes after-love the more.<br>
If she do frown, &#8217;tis not in hate of you,<br>
But rather to beget more love in you:<br>
If she do chide, &#8217;tis not to have you gone;<br>
For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.<br>
Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;<br>
For &#8216;get you gone,&#8217; she doth not mean
&#8216;away!&#8217;<br>
Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;<br>
Though ne&#8217;er so black, say they have angels&#8217; faces.<br>
That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,<br>
If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But she I mean is promised by her friends<br>
Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,<br>
And kept severely from resort of men,<br>
That no man hath access by day to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I would resort to her by night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but the doors be lock&#8217;d and keys kept
safe,<br>
That no man hath recourse to her by night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What lets but one may enter at her window?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,<br>
And built so shelving that one cannot climb it<br>
Without apparent hazard of his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,<br>
To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,<br>
Would serve to scale another Hero&#8217;s tower,<br>
So bold Leander would adventure it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,<br>
Advise me where I may have such a ladder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me
that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This very night; for Love is like a child,<br>
That longs for every thing that he can come by.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">By seven o&#8217;clock I&#8217;ll get you such a
ladder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:<br>
How shall I best convey the ladder thither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">It will be light, my lord, that you may bear
it<br>
Under a cloak that is of any length.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Then let me see thy cloak:<br>
I&#8217;ll get me one of such another length.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?<br>
I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.<br>
What letter is this same? What&#8217;s here? &#8216;To
Silvia&#8217;!<br>
And here an engine fit for my proceeding.<br>
I&#8217;ll be so bold to break the seal for once.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Reads</span></p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia
nightly,<br>
And slaves they are to me that send them flying:<br>
O, could their master come and go as lightly,<br>
Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!<br>
My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:<br>
While I, their king, that hither them importune,<br>
Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless&#8217;d
them,<br>
Because myself do want my servants&#8217; fortune:<br>
I curse myself, for they are sent by me,<br>
That they should harbour where their lord would be.&#8217;<br>
What&#8217;s here?<br>
&#8216;Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.&#8217;<br>
&#8217;Tis so; and here&#8217;s the ladder for the purpose.<br>
Why, Phaeton,&#8212;for thou art Merops&#8217; son,&#8212;<br>
Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car<br>
And with thy daring folly burn the world?<br>
Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?<br>
Go, base intruder! overweening slave!<br>
Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,<br>
And think my patience, more than thy desert,<br>
Is privilege for thy departure hence:<br>
Thank me for this more than for all the favours<br>
Which all too much I have bestow&#8217;d on thee.<br>
But if thou linger in my territories<br>
Longer than swiftest expedition<br>
Will give thee time to leave our royal court,<br>
By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love<br>
I ever bore my daughter or thyself.<br>
Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;<br>
But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And why not death rather than living torment?<br>
To die is to be banish&#8217;d from myself;<br>
And Silvia is myself: banish&#8217;d from her<br>
Is self from self: a deadly banishment!<br>
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?<br>
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?<br>
Unless it be to think that she is by<br>
And feed upon the shadow of perfection<br>
Except I be by Silvia in the night,<br>
There is no music in the nightingale;<br>
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,<br>
There is no day for me to look upon;<br>
She is my essence, and I leave to be,<br>
If I be not by her fair influence<br>
Foster&#8217;d, illumined, cherish&#8217;d, kept alive.<br>
I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:<br>
Tarry I here, I but attend on death:<br>
But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus and
Launce</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Soho, soho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What seest thou?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Him we go to find: there&#8217;s not a hair
on&#8217;s head
but &#8217;tis a Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Valentine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Who then? his spirit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Who wouldst thou strike?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Villain, forbear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I&#8217;ll strike nothing: I pray
you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a
word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,<br>
So much of bad already hath possess&#8217;d them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,<br>
For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Is Silvia dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.<br>
Hath she forsworn me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.<br>
What is your news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, there is a proclamation that you are
vanished.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That thou art banished&#8212;O, that&#8217;s the
news!&#8212;<br>
From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">O, I have fed upon this woe already,<br>
And now excess of it will make me surfeit.<br>
Doth Silvia know that I am banished?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay; and she hath offer&#8217;d to the
doom&#8212;<br>
Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force&#8212;<br>
A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:<br>
Those at her father&#8217;s churlish feet she tender&#8217;d;<br>
With them, upon her knees, her humble self;<br>
Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them<br>
As if but now they waxed pale for woe:<br>
But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,<br>
Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,<br>
Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;<br>
But Valentine, if he be ta&#8217;en, must die.<br>
Besides, her intercession chafed him so,<br>
When she for thy repeal was suppliant,<br>
That to close prison he commanded her,<br>
With many bitter threats of biding there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No more; unless the next word that thou
speak&#8217;st<br>
Have some malignant power upon my life:<br>
If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,<br>
As ending anthem of my endless dolour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,<br>
And study help for that which thou lament&#8217;st.<br>
Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.<br>
Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;<br>
Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.<br>
Hope is a lover&#8217;s staff; walk hence with that<br>
And manage it against despairing thoughts.<br>
Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;<br>
Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver&#8217;d<br>
Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.<br>
The time now serves not to expostulate:<br>
Come, I&#8217;ll convey thee through the city-gate;<br>
And, ere I part with thee, confer at large<br>
Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.<br>
As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,<br>
Regard thy danger, and along with me!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,<br>
Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Valentine and
Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit
to
think my master is a kind of a knave: but that&#8217;s
all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
&#8217;tis I love; and yet &#8217;tis a woman; but what woman,
I
will not tell myself; and yet &#8217;tis a milkmaid; yet
&#8217;tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet &#8217;tis
a maid, for she is her master&#8217;s maid, and serves for
wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
which is much in a bare Christian.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pulling out a
paper</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here is the cate-log of her condition.
&#8216;Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.&#8217; Why, a horse
can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
carry; therefore is she better than a jade. &#8216;Item:
She can milk;&#8217; look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
with clean hands.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Speed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
mastership?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">With my master&#8217;s ship? why, it is at
sea.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Well, your old vice still; mistake the word.
What
news, then, in your paper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">The blackest news that ever thou heardest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, man, how black?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, as black as ink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Let me read them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Thou liest; I can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot
thee?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, the son of my grandfather.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Reads]</span>
&#8216;Imprimis: She can milk.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, that she can.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She brews good ale.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">And thereof comes the proverb: &#8216;Blessing of
your
heart, you brew good ale.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She can sew.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as much as to say, Can she so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She can knit.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">What need a man care for a stock with a wench,
when
she can knit him a stock?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She can wash and scour.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">A special virtue: for then she need not be
washed
and scoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She can spin.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Then may I set the world on wheels, when she
can
spin for her living.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She hath many nameless
virtues.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s as much as to say, bastard virtues;
that,
indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Here follow her vices.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Close at the heels of her virtues.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in
respect
of her breath.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast.
Read on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She hath a sweet mouth.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">That makes amends for her sour breath.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She doth talk in her
sleep.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">It&#8217;s no matter for that, so she sleep not
in her talk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She is slow in words.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">O villain, that set this down among her vices!
To
be slow in words is a woman&#8217;s only virtue: I pray
thee, out with&#8217;t, and place it for her chief virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She is proud.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Out with that too; it was Eve&#8217;s legacy, and
cannot
be ta&#8217;en from her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She hath no teeth.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">I care not for that neither, because I love
crusts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She is curst.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She will often praise her
liquor.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will
not, I
will; for good things should be praised.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She is too liberal.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Of her tongue she cannot, for that&#8217;s writ
down she
is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
I&#8217;ll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
that cannot I help. Well, proceed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She hath more hair than wit, and
more faults
than hairs, and more wealth than faults.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Stop there; I&#8217;ll have her: she was mine,
and not
mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
Rehearse that once more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Item: She hath more hair than
wit,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">More hair than wit? It may be; I&#8217;ll prove
it. The
cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
less. What&#8217;s next?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;And more faults than
hairs,&#8217;&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s monstrous: O, that that were
out!</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;And more wealth than faults.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, that word makes the faults gracious.
Well,
I&#8217;ll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
impossible,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">What then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then will I tell thee&#8212;that thy master
stays
for thee at the North-gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">For me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for
a
better man than thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And must I go to him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so
long
that going will scarce serve the turn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love
letters!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Now will he be swinged for reading my letter;
an
unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
secrets! I&#8217;ll after, to rejoice in the boy&#8217;s
correction.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<h4>Scene II. The same. The Duke&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke and
Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love
you,<br>
Now Valentine is banish&#8217;d from her sight.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Since his exile she hath despised me most,<br>
Forsworn my company and rail&#8217;d at me,<br>
That I am desperate of obtaining her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This weak impress of love is as a figure<br>
Trenched in ice, which with an hour&#8217;s heat<br>
Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.<br>
A little time will melt her frozen thoughts<br>
And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman<br>
According to our proclamation gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Gone, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">My daughter takes his going grievously.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.<br>
Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee&#8212;<br>
For thou hast shown some sign of good desert&#8212;<br>
Makes me the better to confer with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Longer than I prove loyal to your grace<br>
Let me not live to look upon your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Thou know&#8217;st how willingly I would
effect<br>
The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I do, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">And also, I think, thou art not ignorant<br>
How she opposes her against my will</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and perversely she persevers so.<br>
What might we do to make the girl forget<br>
The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">The best way is to slander Valentine<br>
With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,<br>
Three things that women highly hold in hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but she&#8217;ll think that it is spoke in
hate.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if his enemy deliver it:<br>
Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken<br>
By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Then you must undertake to slander him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:<br>
&#8217;Tis an ill office for a gentleman,<br>
Especially against his very friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Where your good word cannot advantage him,<br>
Your slander never can endamage him;<br>
Therefore the office is indifferent,<br>
Being entreated to it by your friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">You have prevail&#8217;d, my lord; if I can do
it<br>
By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,<br>
She shall not long continue love to him.<br>
But say this weed her love from Valentine,<br>
It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,<br>
Lest it should ravel and be good to none,<br>
You must provide to bottom it on me;<br>
Which must be done by praising me as much<br>
As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,<br>
Because we know, on Valentine&#8217;s report,<br>
You are already Love&#8217;s firm votary<br>
And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.<br>
Upon this warrant shall you have access<br>
Where you with Silvia may confer at large;<br>
For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,<br>
And, for your friend&#8217;s sake, will be glad of you;<br>
Where you may temper her by your persuasion<br>
To hate young Valentine and love my friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">As much as I can do, I will effect:<br>
But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;<br>
You must lay lime to tangle her desires<br>
By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes<br>
Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Ay,<br>
Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Say that upon the altar of her beauty<br>
You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:<br>
Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears<br>
Moist it again, and frame some feeling line<br>
That may discover such integrity:<br>
For Orpheus&#8217; lute was strung with poets&#8217; sinews,<br>
Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,<br>
Make tigers tame and huge leviathans<br>
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.<br>
After your dire-lamenting elegies,<br>
Visit by night your lady&#8217;s chamber-window<br>
With some sweet concert; to their instruments<br>
Tune a deploring dump: the night&#8217;s dead silence<br>
Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.<br>
This, or else nothing, will inherit her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">This discipline shows thou hast been in love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">And thy advice this night I&#8217;ll put in
practise.<br>
Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,<br>
Let us into the city presently<br>
To sort some gentlemen well skill&#8217;d in music.<br>
I have a sonnet that will serve the turn<br>
To give the onset to thy good advice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">About it, gentlemen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll wait upon your grace till after
supper,<br>
And afterward determine our proceedings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Even now about it! I will pardon you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
