<h4>Scene I. Gloucester&#8217;s castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edmund, and Curan meets
him</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Save thee, Curan.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curan</p>
<p class="speech">And you, sir. I have been with your father,
and
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
his duchess will be here with him this night.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">How comes that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curan</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news
abroad;
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
ear-kissing arguments?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Not I pray you, what are they?</p>
<p class="speaker">Curan</p>
<p class="speech">Have you heard of no likely wars toward,
&#8217;twixt the<br>
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Not a word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Curan</p>
<p class="speech">You may do, then, in time. Fare you well,
sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">The duke be here to-night? The better! best!<br>
This weaves itself perforce into my business.<br>
My father hath set guard to take my brother;<br>
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,<br>
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!<br>
Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speech">My father watches: O sir, fly this place;<br>
Intelligence is given where you are hid;<br>
You have now the good advantage of the night:<br>
Have you not spoken &#8217;gainst the Duke of Cornwall?<br>
He&#8217;s coming hither: now, i&#8217; the night, i&#8217; the
haste,<br>
And Regan with him: have you nothing said<br>
Upon his party &#8217;gainst the Duke of Albany?<br>
Advise yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I am sure on&#8217;t, not a
word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I hear my father coming: pardon me:<br>
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you<br>
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.<br>
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!<br>
Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speech">Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Wounds his arm</span></p>
<p class="speech">Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen
drunkards<br>
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!<br>
Stop, stop! No help?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester, and
Servants with torches</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Edmund, where&#8217;s the villain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword
out,<br>
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon<br>
To stand auspicious mistress,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Look, sir, I bleed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the villain, Edmund?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Fled this way, sir. When by no means he
could&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Pursue him, ho! Go after.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt some
Servants</span></p>
<p class="speech">By no means what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;<br>
But that I told him, the revenging gods<br>
&#8217;Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;<br>
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond<br>
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,<br>
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood<br>
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,<br>
With his prepared sword, he charges home<br>
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:<br>
But when he saw my best alarum&#8217;d spirits,<br>
Bold in the quarrel&#8217;s right, roused to the encounter,<br>
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,<br>
Full suddenly he fled.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let him fly far:<br>
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;<br>
And found&#8212;dispatch. The noble duke my master,<br>
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:<br>
By his authority I will proclaim it,<br>
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,<br>
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;<br>
He that conceals him, death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">When I dissuaded him from his intent,<br>
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech<br>
I threaten&#8217;d to discover him: he replied,<br>
&#8216;Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,<br>
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal<br>
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee<br>
Make thy words faith&#8217;d? No: what I should deny,&#8212;<br>
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce<br>
My very character,&#8212;I&#8217;ld turn it all<br>
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:<br>
And thou must make a dullard of the world,<br>
If they not thought the profits of my death<br>
Were very pregnant and potential spurs<br>
To make thee seek it.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Strong and fasten&#8217;d villain<br>
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Tucket within</span></p>
<p class="speech">Hark, the duke&#8217;s trumpets! I know not why
he comes.<br>
All ports I&#8217;ll bar; the villain shall not &#8217;scape;<br>
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture<br>
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom<br>
May have the due note of him; and of my land,<br>
Loyal and natural boy, I&#8217;ll work the means<br>
To make thee capable.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cornwall, Regan, and
Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">How now, my noble friend! since I came
hither,<br>
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">If it be true, all vengeance comes too short<br>
Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, madam, my old heart is crack&#8217;d,
it&#8217;s crack&#8217;d!</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">What, did my father&#8217;s godson seek your
life?<br>
He whom my father named? your Edgar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Was he not companion with the riotous knights<br>
That tend upon my father?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know not, madam: &#8217;tis too bad, too
bad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, madam, he was of that consort.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:<br>
&#8217;Tis they have put him on the old man&#8217;s death,<br>
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.<br>
I have this present evening from my sister<br>
Been well inform&#8217;d of them; and with such cautions,<br>
That if they come to sojourn at my house,<br>
I&#8217;ll not be there.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Nor I, assure thee, Regan.<br>
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father<br>
A child-like office.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twas my duty, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He did bewray his practise; and received<br>
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Is he pursued?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Ay, my good lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">If he be taken, he shall never more<br>
Be fear&#8217;d of doing harm: make your own purpose,<br>
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,<br>
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant<br>
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:<br>
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;<br>
You we first seize on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">I shall serve you, sir,<br>
Truly, however else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">For him I thank your grace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">You know not why we came to visit you,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed
night:<br>
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,<br>
Wherein we must have use of your advice:<br>
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,<br>
Of differences, which I least thought it fit<br>
To answer from our home; the several messengers<br>
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,<br>
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow<br>
Your needful counsel to our business,<br>
Which craves the instant use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I serve you, madam:<br>
Your graces are right welcome.</p>

severally</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this
house?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Ay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Where may we set our horses?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217; the mire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">I love thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, I care not for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make
thee
care for me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow, I know thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou know me for?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats;
a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
the least syllable of thy addition.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to
rail
on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny
thou
knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
shines; I&#8217;ll make a sop o&#8217; the moonshine of you:
draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Drawing his sword</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Away! I have nothing to do with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against
the
king; and take vanity the puppet&#8217;s part against the
royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I&#8217;ll so
carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Help, ho! murder! help!</p>

neat
slave, strike.</p>

<p class="speech">Help, ho! murder! murder!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edmund, with his rapier
drawn, Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, and Servants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">How now! What&#8217;s the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">With you, goodman boy, an you please: come,
I&#8217;ll
flesh ye; come on, young master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Weapons! arms! What &#8217;s the matter here?</p>

He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">The messengers from our sister and the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">What is your difference? speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">I am scarce in breath, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour.
You
cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
tailor made thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a
man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter
could
not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
hours at the trade.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have
spared
at suit of his gray beard,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter!
My
lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, sirrah!<br>
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Why art thou angry?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">That such a slave as this should wear a
sword,<br>
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,<br>
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain<br>
Which are too intrinse t&#8217; unloose; smooth every passion<br>
That in the natures of their lords rebel;<br>
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;<br>
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks<br>
With every gale and vary of their masters,<br>
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.<br>
A plague upon your epileptic visage!<br>
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?<br>
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,<br>
I&#8217;ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Why, art thou mad, old fellow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">How fell you out? say that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">No contraries hold more antipathy<br>
Than I and such a knave.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Why dost thou call him a knave? What&#8217;s his
offence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">His countenance likes me not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor
hers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, &#8217;tis my occupation to be plain:<br>
I have seen better faces in my time<br>
Than stands on any shoulder that I see<br>
Before me at this instant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">This is some fellow,<br>
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect<br>
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb<br>
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,<br>
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!<br>
An they will take it, so; if not, he&#8217;s plain.<br>
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness<br>
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends<br>
Than twenty silly ducking observants<br>
That stretch their duties nicely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,<br>
Under the allowance of your great aspect,<br>
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire<br>
On flickering Phoebus&#8217; front,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">What mean&#8217;st by this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">To go out of my dialect, which you
discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
to entreat me to &#8217;t.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">What was the offence you gave him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">I never gave him any:<br>
It pleased the king his master very late<br>
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;<br>
When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,<br>
Tripp&#8217;d me behind; being down, insulted, rail&#8217;d,<br>
And put upon him such a deal of man,<br>
That worthied him, got praises of the king<br>
For him attempting who was self-subdued;<br>
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,<br>
Drew on me here again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">None of these rogues and cowards<br>
But Ajax is their fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch forth the stocks!<br>
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,<br>
We&#8217;ll teach you&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Sir, I am too old to learn:<br>
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;<br>
On whose employment I was sent to you:<br>
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice<br>
Against the grace and person of my master,<br>
Stocking his messenger.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and
honour,<br>
There shall he sit till noon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night
too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Why, madam, if I were your father&#8217;s
dog,<br>
You should not use me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, being his knave, I will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">This is a fellow of the self-same colour<br>
Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Stocks brought out</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let me beseech your grace not to do so:<br>
His fault is much, and the good king his master<br>
Will cheque him for &#8217;t: your purposed low correction<br>
Is such as basest and contemned&#8217;st wretches<br>
For pilferings and most common trespasses<br>
Are punish&#8217;d with: the king must take it ill,<br>
That he&#8217;s so slightly valued in his messenger,<br>
Should have him thus restrain&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll answer that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">My sister may receive it much more worse,<br>
To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,<br>
For following her affairs. Put in his legs.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kent is put in the
stocks</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, my good lord, away.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Gloucester and
Kent</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I am sorry for thee, friend; &#8217;tis the

Whose disposition, all the world well knows,<br>
Will not be rubb&#8217;d nor stopp&#8217;d: I&#8217;ll entreat for
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and
travell&#8217;d hard;<br>
Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I&#8217;ll whistle.<br>
A good man&#8217;s fortune may grow out at heels:<br>
Give you good morrow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>

be ill taken.</p>

<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Good king, that must approve the common saw,<br>
Thou out of heaven&#8217;s benediction comest<br>
To the warm sun!<br>
Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,<br>
That by thy comfortable beams I may<br>
Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles<br>
But misery: I know &#8217;tis from Cordelia,<br>
Who hath most fortunately been inform&#8217;d<br>
Of my obscured course; and shall find time<br>
From this enormous state, seeking to give<br>
Losses their remedies. All weary and o&#8217;erwatch&#8217;d,<br>
Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold<br>
This shameful lodging.<br>
Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!</p>

Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may &#8217;scape,<br>
I will preserve myself: and am bethought<br>
To take the basest and most poorest shape<br>
That ever penury, in contempt of man,<br>
Brought near to beast: my face I&#8217;ll grime with filth;<br>
Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;<br>
And with presented nakedness out-face<br>
The winds and persecutions of the sky.<br>
The country gives me proof and precedent<br>
Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,<br>
Strike in their numb&#8217;d and mortified bare arms<br>
Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;<br>
And with this horrible object, from low farms,<br>
Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,<br>
Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,<br>
Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!<br>
That&#8217;s something yet: Edgar I nothing am.</p>

<p class="speech">No, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are
tied
by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by

I did commend your highness&#8217; letters to them,<br>
Ere I was risen from the place that show&#8217;d<br>
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,<br>
Stew&#8217;d in his haste, half breathless, panting forth<br>
From Goneril his mistress salutations;<br>
Deliver&#8217;d letters, spite of intermission,<br>
Which presently they read: on whose contents,<br>
They summon&#8217;d up their meiny, straight took horse;<br>
Commanded me to follow, and attend<br>
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:<br>
And meeting here the other messenger,<br>
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison&#8217;d mine,&#8212;<br>
Being the very fellow that of late<br>
Display&#8217;d so saucily against your highness,&#8212;<br>
Having more man than wit about me, drew:<br>
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.<br>
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth<br>
The shame which here it suffers.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">Winter&#8217;s not gone yet, if the wild-geese
fly that way.<br>
Fathers that wear rags<br>
Do make their children blind;<br>
But fathers that bear bags<br>
Shall see their children kind.<br>
Fortune, that arrant whore,<br>
Ne&#8217;er turns the key to the poor.<br>
But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>

<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">And thou hadst been set i&#8217; the stocks for

<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Why, fool?</p>
<p class="speaker">Fool</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll set thee to school to an ant, to
teach thee
there&#8217;s no labouring i&#8217; the winter. All that follow
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
there&#8217;s not a nose among twenty but can smell him
that&#8217;s stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
following it: but the great one that goes up the
hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.<br>
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,<br>
And follows but for form,<br>
Will pack when it begins to rain,<br>
And leave thee in the storm,<br>
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,<br>
And let the wise man fly:<br>
The knave turns fool that runs away;<br>
The fool no knave, perdy.</p>

<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!<br>
Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,<br>
I&#8217;ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Well, my good lord, I have inform&#8217;d them
so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>

<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord.</p>

Are they inform&#8217;d of this? My breath and blood!<br>
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that&#8212;<br>
No, but not yet: may be he is not well:<br>
Infirmity doth still neglect all office<br>
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves<br>
When nature, being oppress&#8217;d, commands the mind<br>
To suffer with the body: I&#8217;ll forbear;<br>
And am fall&#8217;n out with my more headier will,<br>

Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,<br>
Or at their chamber-door I&#8217;ll beat the drum<br>

I would divorce me from thy mother&#8217;s tomb,<br>
Sepulchring an adultress.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Kent</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, are you free?<br>
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,<br>
Thy sister&#8217;s naught: O Regan, she hath tied<br>
Sharp-tooth&#8217;d unkindness, like a vulture, here:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Points to his
heart</span></p>
<p class="speech">I can scarce speak to thee; thou&#8217;lt not

With how depraved a quality&#8212;O Regan!</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.<br>
You less know how to value her desert<br>
Than she to scant her duty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Say, how is that?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I cannot think my sister in the least<br>
Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance<br>
She have restrain&#8217;d the riots of your followers,<br>
&#8217;Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,<br>
As clears her from all blame.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">My curses on her!</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, sir, you are old.<br>
Nature in you stands on the very verge<br>
Of her confine: you should be ruled and led<br>
By some discretion, that discerns your state<br>
Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,<br>
That to our sister you do make return;<br>
Say you have wrong&#8217;d her, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Ask her forgiveness?<br>

&#8216;Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneeling</span></p>

Regan:<br>
She hath abated me of half my train;<br>

All the stored vengeances of heaven fall<br>
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,<br>
You taking airs, with lameness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">Fie, sir, fie!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding

<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,<br>

<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:<br>
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give<br>
Thee o&#8217;er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine<br>
Do comfort and not burn. &#8217;Tis not in thee<br>
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,<br>
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,<br>
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt<br>
Against my coming in: thou better know&#8217;st<br>
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,<br>
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;<br>
Thy half o&#8217; the kingdom hast thou not forgot,<br>

<p class="speech">What means your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Who stock&#8217;d my servant? Regan, I have good

Thou didst not know on&#8217;t. Who comes here? O heavens,</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">If you do love old men, if your sweet sway<br>
Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,<br>
Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?<br>
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Why not by the hand, sir? How have I
offended?<br>
All&#8217;s not offence that indiscretion finds<br>
And dotage terms so.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O sides, you are too tough;<br>
Will you yet hold? How came my man i&#8217; the stocks?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cornwall</p>
<p class="speech">I set him there, sir: but his own disorders<br>
Deserved much less advancement.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You! did you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.<br>
If, till the expiration of your month,<br>
You will return and sojourn with my sister,<br>
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:<br>
I am now from home, and out of that provision<br>
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Return to her, and fifty men dismiss&#8217;d?<br>
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose<br>
To wage against the enmity o&#8217; the air;<br>
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,&#8212;<br>
Necessity&#8217;s sharp pinch! Return with her?<br>
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took<br>
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought<br>
To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg<br>
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?<br>
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter<br>
To this detested groom.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Pointing at Oswald</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">At your choice, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:<br>
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:<br>
We&#8217;ll no more meet, no more see one another:<br>
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;<br>
Or rather a disease that&#8217;s in my flesh,<br>
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,<br>
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,<br>
In my corrupted blood. But I&#8217;ll not chide thee;<br>
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:<br>
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,<br>
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:<br>
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:<br>
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,<br>
I and my hundred knights.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Not altogether so:<br>
I look&#8217;d not for you yet, nor am provided<br>
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;<br>
For those that mingle reason with your passion<br>
Must be content to think you old, and so&#8212;<br>
But she knows what she does.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Is this well spoken?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?<br>
Is it not well? What should you need of more?<br>
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger<br>
Speak &#8217;gainst so great a number? How, in one house,<br>
Should many people, under two commands,<br>
Hold amity? &#8217;Tis hard; almost impossible.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Why might not you, my lord, receive
attendance<br>
From those that she calls servants or from mine?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack
you,<br>
We could control them. If you will come to me,&#8212;<br>
For now I spy a danger,&#8212;I entreat you<br>
To bring but five and twenty: to no more<br>
Will I give place or notice.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I gave you all&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;And in good time you gave it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Made you my guardians, my depositaries;<br>
But kept a reservation to be follow&#8217;d<br>
With such a number. What, must I come to you<br>
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">And speak&#8217;t again, my lord; no more with
me.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Those wicked creatures yet do look
well-favour&#8217;d,<br>
When others are more wicked: not being the worst<br>
Stands in some rank of praise.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Goneril</span></p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll go with thee:<br>
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,<br>
And thou art twice her love.</p>

<p class="speech">Hear me, my lord;<br>
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,<br>
To follow in a house where twice so many<br>
Have a command to tend you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">What need one?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O, reason not the need: our basest beggars<br>
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:<br>
Allow not nature more than nature needs,<br>
Man&#8217;s life&#8217;s as cheap as beast&#8217;s: thou art a
lady;<br>
If only to go warm were gorgeous,<br>
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear&#8217;st,<br>
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,&#8212;<br>
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!<br>
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,<br>
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!<br>
If it be you that stir these daughters&#8217; hearts<br>
Against their father, fool me not so much<br>
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,<br>
And let not women&#8217;s weapons, water-drops,<br>
Stain my man&#8217;s cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,<br>
I will have such revenges on you both,<br>
That all the world shall&#8212;I will do such things,&#8212;<br>
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be<br>
The terrors of the earth. You think I&#8217;ll weep<br>
No, I&#8217;ll not weep:<br>
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart<br>
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,<br>
Or ere I&#8217;ll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!</p>
