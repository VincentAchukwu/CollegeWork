<h4>Scene I. Milan. The Duke&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine and
Speed</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, your glove.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Not mine; my gloves are on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it&#8217;s
mine:<br>
Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!<br>
Ah, Silvia, Silvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How now, sirrah?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She is not within hearing, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, who bade you call her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Well, you&#8217;ll still be too forward.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And yet I was last chidden for being too
slow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam
Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She that your worship loves?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, how know you that I am in love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, by these special marks: first, you
have
learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
on you, I can hardly think you my master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Are all these things perceived in me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">They are all perceived without ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Without me? they cannot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Without you? nay, that&#8217;s certain, for,
without you
were so simple, none else would: but you are so
without these follies, that these follies are within
you and shine through you like the water in an
urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
physician to comment on your malady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">She that you gaze on so as she sits at
supper?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, sir, I know her not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and
yet
knowest her not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Is she not hard-favoured, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, I know that well enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What dost thou know?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">That she is not so fair as, of you,
well-favoured.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her
favour infinite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s because the one is painted and the
other out
of all count.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How painted? and how out of count?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that
no
man counts of her beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How esteemest thou me? I account of her
beauty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">You never saw her since she was deformed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How long hath she been deformed?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Ever since you loved her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still
I
see her beautiful.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">If you love her, you cannot see her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine
eyes;
or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
ungartered!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What should I see then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Your own present folly and her passing
deformity:
for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank
you,
you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
bolder to chide you for yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">In conclusion, I stand affected to her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">I would you were set, so your affection would
cease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Last night she enjoined me to write some lines
to
one she loves.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And have you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I have.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Are they not lamely writ?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
here she comes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O excellent
motion! O exceeding puppet!<br>
Now will he interpret to her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Silvia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O, give ye
good even! here&#8217;s a million of manners.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Valentine and servant, to you two
thousand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> He should give
her interest and she gives it him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">As you enjoin&#8217;d me, I have writ your
letter<br>
Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;<br>
Which I was much unwilling to proceed in<br>
But for my duty to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I thank you gentle servant: &#8217;tis very
clerkly done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;<br>
For being ignorant to whom it goes<br>
I writ at random, very doubtfully.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Perchance you think too much of so much
pains?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, madam; so it stead you, I will write<br>
Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;<br>
And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;<br>
And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,<br>
Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And yet you
will; and yet another &#8216;yet.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What means your ladyship? do you not like it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;<br>
But since unwillingly, take them again.<br>
Nay, take them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, they are for you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;<br>
But I will none of them; they are for you;<br>
I would have had them writ more movingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, I&#8217;ll write your ladyship
another.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">And when it&#8217;s writ, for my sake read it
over,<br>
And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">If it please me, madam, what then?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Why, if it please you, take it for your
labour:<br>
And so, good morrow, servant.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,<br>
As a nose on a man&#8217;s face, or a weathercock on a steeple!<br>
My master sues to her, and she hath
taught her suitor,<br>
He being her pupil, to become her tutor.<br>
O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,<br>
That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
the letter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How now, sir? what are you reasoning with
yourself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, I was rhyming: &#8217;tis you that have the
reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To do what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To whom?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">What figure?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">By a letter, I should say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she hath not writ to me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">What need she, when she hath made you write
to
yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">No, believe me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you
perceive
her earnest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">She gave me none, except an angry word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, she hath given you a letter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s the letter I writ to her friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">And that letter hath she delivered, and there an
end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I would it were no worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll warrant you, &#8217;tis as well:<br>
For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,<br>
Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;<br>
Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,<br>
Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.<br>
All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.<br>
Why muse you, sir? &#8217;tis dinner-time.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I have dined.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love
can
feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
your mistress; be moved, be moved.</p>

The next ensuing hour some foul mischance<br>
Torment me for my love&#8217;s forgetfulness!<br>
My father stays my coming; answer not;<br>
The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;<br>
That tide will stay me longer than I should.<br>
Julia, farewell!</p>

<h4>Scene III. The same. A street.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Launce, leading a
dog</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, &#8217;twill be this hour ere I have done
weeping;
all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
have received my proportion, like the prodigious
son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial&#8217;s
court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
parting. Nay, I&#8217;ll show you the manner of it. This
shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
on&#8217;t! there &#8217;tis: now, sit, this staff is my
sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
dog&#8212;Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
&#8217;tis; here&#8217;s my mother&#8217;s breath up and down.
Now
come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Panthino</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is
shipped
and thou art to post after with oars. What&#8217;s the
matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You&#8217;ll
lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is
the
unkindest tied that ever any man tied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s the unkindest tide?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he that&#8217;s tied here, Crab, my dog.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Tut, man, I mean thou&#8217;lt lose the flood,
and, in
losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
service,&#8212;Why dost thou stop my mouth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Panthino</p>
<p class="speech">Where should I lose my tongue?</p>

<p class="speech">In thy tail!</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,
and
the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.</p>

thee.</p>

<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire.
Sir
Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship&#8217;s looks,
and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.</p>

make your wit bankrupt.</p>

words,

What say you to a letter from your friends<br>
Of much good news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lord, I will be thankful.<br>
To any happy messenger from thence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman<br>
To be of worth and worthy estimation<br>
And not without desert so well reputed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Hath he not a son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves<br>
The honour and regard of such a father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">You know him well?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I know him as myself; for from our infancy<br>
We have conversed and spent our hours together:<br>
And though myself have been an idle truant,<br>
Omitting the sweet benefit of time<br>
To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,<br>
Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that&#8217;s his name,<br>
Made use and fair advantage of his days;<br>
His years but young, but his experience old;<br>
His head unmellow&#8217;d, but his judgment ripe;<br>
And, in a word, for far behind his worth<br>
Comes all the praises that I now bestow,<br>
He is complete in feature and in mind<br>
With all good grace to grace a gentleman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,<br>
He is as worthy for an empress&#8217; love<br>
As meet to be an emperor&#8217;s counsellor.<br>
Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,<br>
With commendation from great potentates;<br>
And here he means to spend his time awhile:<br>
I think &#8217;tis no unwelcome news to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Should I have wish&#8217;d a thing, it had been
he.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome him then according to his worth.<br>
Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;<br>
For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:<br>
I will send him hither to you presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">This is the gentleman I told your ladyship<br>
Had come along with me, but that his mistress<br>
Did hold his eyes lock&#8217;d in her crystal looks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Belike that now she hath enfranchised them<br>
Upon some other pawn for fealty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners
still.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, then he should be blind; and, being
blind<br>
How could he see his way to seek out you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">They say that Love hath not an eye at all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:<br>
Upon a homely object Love can wink.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Have done, have done; here comes the
gentleman.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech
you,<br>
Confirm his welcome with some special favour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,<br>
If this be he you oft have wish&#8217;d to hear from.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him<br>
To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Too low a mistress for so high a servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant<br>
To have a look of such a worthy mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Leave off discourse of disability:<br>
Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My duty will I boast of; nothing else.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">And duty never yet did want his meed:<br>
Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll die on him that says so but
yourself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">That you are welcome?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That you are worthless.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, my lord your father would speak with
you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,<br>
Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:<br>
I&#8217;ll leave you to confer of home affairs;<br>
When you have done, we look to hear from you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll both attend upon your ladyship.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Silvia and
Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Now, tell me, how do all from whence you
came?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Your friends are well and have them much
commended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And how do yours?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I left them all in health.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How does your lady? and how thrives your
love?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My tales of love were wont to weary you;<br>
I know you joy not in a love discourse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter&#8217;d
now:<br>
I have done penance for contemning Love,<br>
Whose high imperious thoughts have punish&#8217;d me<br>
With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,<br>
With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;<br>
For in revenge of my contempt of love,<br>
Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes<br>
And made them watchers of mine own heart&#8217;s sorrow.<br>
O gentle Proteus, Love&#8217;s a mighty lord,<br>
And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,<br>
There is no woe to his correction,<br>
Nor to his service no such joy on earth.<br>
Now no discourse, except it be of love;<br>
Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,<br>
Upon the very naked name of love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.<br>
Was this the idol that you worship so?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No; but she is an earthly paragon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Call her divine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will not flatter her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,<br>
And I must minister the like to you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,<br>
Yet let her be a principality,<br>
Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Except my mistress.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet, except not any;<br>
Except thou wilt except against my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not reason to prefer mine own?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And I will help thee to prefer her too:<br>
She shall be dignified with this high honour&#8212;<br>
To bear my lady&#8217;s train, lest the base earth<br>
Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss<br>
And, of so great a favour growing proud,<br>
Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower<br>
And make rough winter everlastingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing<br>
To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;<br>
She is alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Then let her alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,<br>
And I as rich in having such a jewel<br>
As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,<br>
The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.<br>
Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,<br>
Because thou see&#8217;st me dote upon my love.<br>
My foolish rival, that her father likes<br>
Only for his possessions are so huge,<br>
Is gone with her along, and I must after,<br>
For love, thou know&#8217;st, is full of jealousy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But she loves you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and we are betroth&#8217;d: nay, more,
our,
marriage-hour,<br>
With all the cunning manner of our flight,<br>
Determined of; how I must climb her window,<br>
The ladder made of cords, and all the means<br>
Plotted and &#8216;greed on for my happiness.<br>
Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,<br>
In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:<br>
I must unto the road, to disembark<br>
Some necessaries that I needs must use,<br>
And then I&#8217;ll presently attend you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Will you make haste?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">I will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Valentine</span></p>
<p class="speech">Even as one heat another heat expels,<br>
Or as one nail by strength drives out another,<br>
So the remembrance of my former love<br>
Is by a newer object quite forgotten.<br>
Is it mine, or Valentine&#8217;s praise,<br>
Her true perfection, or my false transgression,<br>
That makes me reasonless to reason thus?<br>
She is fair; and so is Julia that I love&#8212;<br>
That I did love, for now my love is thaw&#8217;d;<br>
Which, like a waxen image, &#8217;gainst a fire,<br>
Bears no impression of the thing it was.<br>
Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,<br>
And that I love him not as I was wont.<br>
O, but I love his lady too too much,<br>
And that&#8217;s the reason I love him so little.<br>
How shall I dote on her with more advice,<br>
That thus without advice begin to love her!<br>
&#8217;Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,<br>
And that hath dazzled my reason&#8217;s light;<br>
But when I look on her perfections,<br>
There is no reason but I shall be blind.<br>
If I can cheque my erring love, I will;<br>
If not, to compass her I&#8217;ll use my skill.</p>

<p class="speech">Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am
not
welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
say &#8216;Welcome!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, you madcap, I&#8217;ll to the alehouse
with you
presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou
shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
did thy master part with Madam Julia?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted
very
fairly in jest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">But shall she marry him?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">How then? shall he marry her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">No, neither.</p>

<p class="speech">Why, then, how stands the matter with them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
stands well with her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">What a block art thou, that thou canst not!
My
staff understands me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">What thou sayest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I&#8217;ll but
lean,
and my staff understands me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">It stands under thee, indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">But tell me true, will&#8217;t be a match?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say
no,
it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">The conclusion is then that it will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by
a parable.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce,

thou, that my master is become a notable lover?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">I never knew him otherwise.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Than how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to
be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy

<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>
<p class="speech">Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn
himself
in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
name of a Christian.</p>
<p class="speaker">Speed</p>
<p class="speech">Why?</p>
<p class="speaker">Launce</p>

To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;<br>
And even that power which gave me first my oath<br>
Provokes me to this threefold perjury;<br>
Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.<br>
O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,<br>
Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!<br>
At first I did adore a twinkling star,<br>
But now I worship a celestial sun.<br>
Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,<br>
And he wants wit that wants resolved will<br>
To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.<br>
Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,<br>
Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr&#8217;d<br>
With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.<br>
I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;<br>
But there I leave to love where I should love.<br>
Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:<br>
If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;<br>
If I lose them, thus find I by their loss<br>
For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.<br>
I to myself am dearer than a friend,<br>
For love is still most precious in itself;<br>
And Silvia&#8212;witness Heaven, that made her fair!&#8212;<br>
Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.<br>
I will forget that Julia is alive,<br>
Remembering that my love to her is dead;<br>
And Valentine I&#8217;ll hold an enemy,<br>
Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.<br>
I cannot now prove constant to myself,<br>
Without some treachery used to Valentine.<br>
This night he meaneth with a corded ladder<br>
To climb celestial Silvia&#8217;s chamber-window,<br>
Myself in counsel, his competitor.<br>
Now presently I&#8217;ll give her father notice<br>
Of their disguising and pretended flight;<br>
Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;<br>
For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;<br>
But, Valentine being gone, I&#8217;ll quickly cross<br>

And even in kind love I do conjure thee,<br>
Who art the table wherein all my thoughts<br>
Are visibly character&#8217;d and engraved,<br>
To lesson me and tell me some good mean<br>
How, with my honour, I may undertake<br>
A journey to my loving Proteus.</p>

To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;<br>
Much less shall she that hath Love&#8217;s wings to fly,<br>
And when the flight is made to one so dear,<br>
Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Better forbear till Proteus make return.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">O, know&#8217;st thou not his looks are my
soul&#8217;s food?<br>
Pity the dearth that I have pined in,<br>
By longing for that food so long a time.<br>
Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,<br>
Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow<br>
As seek to quench the fire of love with words.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">I do not seek to quench your love&#8217;s hot
fire,<br>
But qualify the fire&#8217;s extreme rage,<br>
Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">The more thou damm&#8217;st it up, the more it
burns.<br>
The current that with gentle murmur glides,<br>
Thou know&#8217;st, being stopp&#8217;d, impatiently doth rage;<br>
But when his fair course is not hindered,<br>
He makes sweet music with the enamell&#8217;ed stones,<br>
Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge<br>
He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,<br>
And so by many winding nooks he strays<br>
With willing sport to the wild ocean.<br>
Then let me go and hinder not my course<br>
I&#8217;ll be as patient as a gentle stream<br>
And make a pastime of each weary step,<br>
Till the last step have brought me to my love;<br>
And there I&#8217;ll rest, as after much turmoil<br>
A blessed soul doth in Elysium.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">But in what habit will you go along?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Not like a woman; for I would prevent<br>
The loose encounters of lascivious men:<br>
Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds<br>
As may beseem some well-reputed page.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">No, girl, I&#8217;ll knit it up in silken
strings<br>
With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.<br>
To be fantastic may become a youth<br>
Of greater time than I shall show to be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">What fashion, madam shall I make your
breeches?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That fits as well as &#8216;Tell me, good my
lord,<br>
What compass will you wear your farthingale?&#8217;<br>
Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">You must needs have them with a codpiece,
madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Out, out, Lucetta! that would be
ill-favour&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">A round hose, madam, now&#8217;s not worth a
pin,<br>
Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have<br>
What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.<br>
But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me<br>
For undertaking so unstaid a journey?<br>
I fear me, it will make me scandalized.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">If you think so, then stay at home and go
not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that I will not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Then never dream on infamy, but go.<br>
If Proteus like your journey when you come,<br>
No matter who&#8217;s displeased when you are gone:<br>
I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:<br>
A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears<br>
And instances of infinite of love<br>
Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">All these are servants to deceitful men.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Base men, that use them to so base effect!<br>
But truer stars did govern Proteus&#8217; birth<br>
His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,<br>
His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,<br>
His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,<br>
His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lucetta</p>
<p class="speech">Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to
him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong<br>
To bear a hard opinion of his truth:<br>
Only deserve my love by loving him;<br>
And presently go with me to my chamber,<br>
To take a note of what I stand in need of,<br>
To furnish me upon my longing journey.<br>
All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,<br>
My goods, my lands, my reputation;<br>
Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.<br>
Come, answer not, but to it presently!<br>
I am impatient of my tarriance.</p>
