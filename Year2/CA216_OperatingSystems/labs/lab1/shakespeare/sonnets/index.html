<h4>I</h4>
<p>From fairest creatures we desire increase,<br>
That thereby beauty&#8217;s rose might never die,<br>
But as the riper should by time decease,<br>
His tender heir might bear his memory:<br>
But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,<br>
Feed&#8217;st thy light&#8217;s flame with self-substantial
fuel,<br>
Making a famine where abundance lies,<br>
Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:<br>
Thou that art now the world&#8217;s fresh ornament,<br>
And only herald to the gaudy spring,<br>
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,<br>
And tender churl mak&#8217;st waste in niggarding:<br>
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,<br>
To eat the world&#8217;s due, by the grave and thee.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet2" class="poem" title="II">
<h4>II</h4>
<p>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,<br>
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty&#8217;s field,<br>
Thy youth&#8217;s proud livery so gazed on now,<br>
Will be a tatter&#8217;d weed of small worth held:<br>
Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,<br>
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;<br>
To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,<br>
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.<br>
How much more praise deserv&#8217;d thy beauty&#8217;s use,<br>
If thou couldst answer &#8216;This fair child of mine<br>
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,&#8217;<br>
Proving his beauty by succession thine!<br>
This were to be new made when thou art old,<br>
And see thy blood warm when thou feel&#8217;st it cold.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet3" class="poem" title="III">
<h4>III</h4>
<p>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest<br>
Now is the time that face should form another;<br>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br>
For where is she so fair whose unear&#8217;d womb<br>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,<br>
Of his self-love to stop posterity?<br>
Thou art thy mother&#8217;s glass and she in thee<br>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;<br>
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,<br>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br>
But if thou live, remember&#8217;d not to be,<br>
Die single and thine image dies with thee.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet4" class="poem" title="IV">
<h4>IV</h4>
<p>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend<br>
Upon thy self thy beauty&#8217;s legacy?<br>
Nature&#8217;s bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,<br>
And being frank she lends to those are free:<br>
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse<br>
The bounteous largess given thee to give?<br>
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use<br>
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?<br>
For having traffic with thy self alone,<br>
Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:<br>
Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,<br>
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?<br>
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,<br>
Which, used, lives th&#8217; executor to be.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet5" class="poem" title="V">
<h4>V</h4>
<p>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame<br>
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,<br>
Will play the tyrants to the very same<br>
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;<br>
For never-resting time leads summer on<br>
To hideous winter, and confounds him there;<br>
Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,<br>
Beauty o&#8217;er-snowed and bareness every where:<br>
Then were not summer&#8217;s distillation left,<br>
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,<br>
Beauty&#8217;s effect with beauty were bereft,<br>
Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:<br>
But flowers distill&#8217;d, though they with winter meet,<br>
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet6" class="poem" title="VI">
<h4>VI</h4>
<p>Then let not winter&#8217;s ragged hand deface,<br>
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill&#8217;d:<br>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place<br>
With beauty&#8217;s treasure ere it be self-kill&#8217;d.<br>
That use is not forbidden usury,<br>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br>
That&#8217;s for thy self to breed another thee,<br>
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;<br>
Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,<br>
If ten of thine ten times refigur&#8217;d thee:<br>
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,<br>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br>
Be not self-will&#8217;d, for thou art much too fair<br>
To be death&#8217;s conquest and make worms thine heir.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet7" class="poem" title="VII">
<h4>VII</h4>
<p>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light<br>
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye<br>
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,<br>
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;<br>
And having climb&#8217;d the steep-up heavenly hill,<br>
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,<br>
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,<br>
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:<br>
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,<br>
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,<br>
The eyes, &#8216;fore duteous, now converted are<br>
From his low tract, and look another way:<br>
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon:<br>
Unlook&#8217;d, on diest unless thou get a son.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet8" class="poem" title="VIII">
<h4>VIII</h4>
<p>Music to hear, why hear&#8217;st thou music sadly?<br>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:<br>
Why lov&#8217;st thou that which thou receiv&#8217;st not
gladly,<br>
Or else receiv&#8217;st with pleasure thine annoy?<br>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br>
By unions married, do offend thine ear,<br>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.<br>
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<br>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;<br>
Resembling sire and child and happy mother,<br>
Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br>
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,<br>
Sings this to thee: &#8216;Thou single wilt prove none.&#8217;</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet9" class="poem" title="IX">
<h4>IX</h4>
<p>Is it for fear to wet a widow&#8217;s eye,<br>
That thou consum&#8217;st thy self in single life?<br>
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,<br>
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;<br>
The world will be thy widow and still weep<br>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br>
When every private widow well may keep<br>
By children&#8217;s eyes, her husband&#8217;s shape in mind:<br>
Look! what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br>
But beauty&#8217;s waste hath in the world an end,<br>
And kept unused the user so destroys it.<br>
No love toward others in that bosom sits<br>
That on himself such murd&#8217;rous shame commits.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet10" class="poem" title="X">
<h4>X</h4>
<p>For shame! deny that thou bear&#8217;st love to any,<br>
Who for thy self art so unprovident.<br>
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art belov&#8217;d of many,<br>
But that thou none lov&#8217;st is most evident:<br>
For thou art so possess&#8217;d with murderous hate,<br>
That &#8216;gainst thy self thou stick&#8217;st not to
conspire,<br>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.<br>
O! change thy thought, that I may change my mind:<br>
Shall hate be fairer lodg&#8217;d than gentle love?<br>
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,<br>
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:<br>
Make thee another self for love of me,<br>
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet11" class="poem" title="XI">
<h4>XI</h4>
<p>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow&#8217;st,<br>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<br>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow&#8217;st,<br>
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest,<br>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase;<br>
Without this folly, age, and cold decay:<br>
If all were minded so, the times should cease<br>
And threescore year would make the world away.<br>
Let those whom nature hath not made for store,<br>
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:<br>
Look, whom she best endow&#8217;d, she gave thee more;<br>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br>
She carv&#8217;d thee for her seal, and meant thereby,<br>
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet12" class="poem" title="XII">
<h4>XII</h4>
<p>When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br>
And sable curls, all silvered o&#8217;er with white;<br>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,<br>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br>
And summer&#8217;s green all girded up in sheaves,<br>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br>
Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br>
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br>
And die as fast as they see others grow;<br>
And nothing &#8216;gainst Time&#8217;s scythe can make defence<br>
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet13" class="poem" title="XIII">
<h4>XIII</h4>
<p>O! that you were your self; but, love you are<br>
No longer yours, than you your self here live:<br>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br>
And your sweet semblance to some other give:<br>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br>
Find no determination; then you were<br>
Yourself again, after yourself&#8217;s decease,<br>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold,<br>
Against the stormy gusts of winter&#8217;s day<br>
And barren rage of death&#8217;s eternal cold?<br>
O! none but unthrifts. Dear my love, you know,<br>
You had a father: let your son say so.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet14" class="poem" title="XIV">
<h4>XIV</h4>
<p>Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;<br>
And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br>
But not to tell of good or evil luck,<br>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons&#8217; quality;<br>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<br>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br>
Or say with princes if it shall go well<br>
By oft predict that I in heaven find:<br>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br>
And constant stars in them I read such art<br>
As &#8216;Truth and beauty shall together thrive,<br>
If from thyself, to store thou wouldst convert&#8217;;<br>
Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<br>
&#8216;Thy end is truth&#8217;s and beauty&#8217;s doom and
date.&#8217;</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet15" class="poem" title="XV">
<h4>XV</h4>
<p>When I consider every thing that grows<br>
Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br>
Cheered and checked even by the self-same sky,<br>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br>
And wear their brave state out of memory;<br>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br>
Where wasteful Time debateth with decay<br>
To change your day of youth to sullied night,<br>
And all in war with Time for love of you,<br>
As he takes from you, I engraft you new.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet16" class="poem" title="XVI">
<h4>XVI</h4>
<p>But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br>
And fortify your self in your decay<br>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br>
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,<br>
With virtuous wish would bear you living flowers,<br>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br>
So should the lines of life that life repair,<br>
Which this, Time&#8217;s pencil, or my pupil pen,<br>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br>
Can make you live your self in eyes of men.<br>
To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,<br>
And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet17" class="poem" title="XVII">
<h4>XVII</h4>
<p>Who will believe my verse in time to come,<br>
If it were fill&#8217;d with your most high deserts?<br>
Though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb<br>
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.<br>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,<br>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br>
The age to come would say &#8216;This poet lies;<br>
Such heavenly touches ne&#8217;er touch&#8217;d earthly
faces.&#8217;<br>
So should my papers, yellow&#8217;d with their age,<br>
Be scorn&#8217;d, like old men of less truth than tongue,<br>
And your true rights be term&#8217;d a poet&#8217;s rage<br>
And stretched metre of an antique song:<br>
But were some child of yours alive that time,<br>
You should live twice,&#8212;in it, and in my rhyme.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet18" class="poem" title="XVIII">
<h4>XVIII</h4>
<p>Shall I compare thee to a summer&#8217;s day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
And summer&#8217;s lease hath all too short a date:<br>
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimm&#8217;d,<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
By chance, or nature&#8217;s changing course untrimm&#8217;d:<br>
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow&#8217;st,<br>
Nor shall death brag thou wander&#8217;st in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to time thou grow&#8217;st,<br>
So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet19" class="poem" title="XIX">
<h4>XIX</h4>
<p>Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion&#8217;s paws,<br>
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;<br>
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger&#8217;s jaws,<br>
And burn the long-liv&#8217;d phoenix, in her blood;<br>
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,<br>
And do whate&#8217;er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,<br>
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;<br>
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:<br>
O! carve not with thy hours my love&#8217;s fair brow,<br>
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;<br>
Him in thy course untainted do allow<br>
For beauty&#8217;s pattern to succeeding men.<br>
Yet, do thy worst old Time: despite thy wrong,<br>
My love shall in my verse ever live young.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet20" class="poem" title="XX">
<h4>XX</h4>
<p>A woman&#8217;s face with nature&#8217;s own hand painted,<br>
Hast thou, the master mistress of my passion;<br>
A woman&#8217;s gentle heart, but not acquainted<br>
With shifting change, as is false women&#8217;s fashion:<br>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br>
A man in hue all &#8216;hues&#8217; in his controlling,<br>
Which steals men&#8217;s eyes and women&#8217;s souls amazeth.<br>
And for a woman wert thou first created;<br>
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br>
But since she prick&#8217;d thee out for women&#8217;s
pleasure,<br>
Mine be thy love and thy love&#8217;s use their treasure.</p>

<div id="sonnet21" class="poem" title="XXI">
<h4>XXI</h4>
<p>So is it not with me as with that Muse,<br>
Stirr&#8217;d by a painted beauty to his verse,<br>
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use<br>
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,<br>
Making a couplement of proud compare&#8217;<br>
With sun and moon, with earth and sea&#8217;s rich gems,<br>
With April&#8217;s first-born flowers, and all things rare,<br>
That heaven&#8217;s air in this huge rondure hems.<br>
O! let me, true in love, but truly write,<br>
And then believe me, my love is as fair<br>
As any mother&#8217;s child, though not so bright<br>
As those gold candles fix&#8217;d in heaven&#8217;s air:<br>
Let them say more that like of hearsay well;<br>
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet22" class="poem" title="XXII">
<h4>XXII</h4>
<p>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br>
So long as youth and thou are of one date;<br>
But when in thee time&#8217;s furrows I behold,<br>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<br>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee,<br>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<br>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br>
O! therefore love, be of thyself so wary<br>
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<br>
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<br>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br>
Presume not on th;heart when mine is slain,<br>
Thou gav&#8217;st me thine not to give back again.</p>
</div>
<div id="sonnet23" class="poem" title="XXIII">
<h4>XXIII</h4>
<p>As an unperfect actor on the stage,<br>
Who with his fear is put beside his part,<br>
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,<br>
Whose strength&#8217;s abundance weakens his own heart;<br>
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say<br>
The perfect ceremony of love&#8217;s rite,<br>
And in mine own love&#8217;s strength seem to decay,<br>
O&#8217;ercharg&#8217;d with burthen of mine own love&#8217;s
might.<br>
O! let my looks be then the eloquence<br>
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,<br>
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,<br>
More than that tongue that more hath more express&#8217;d.<br>
O! learn to read what silent love hath writ:<br>
To hear with eyes belongs to love&#8217;s fine wit.</p>

<div id="sonnet24" class="poem" title="XXIV">
<h4>XXIV</h4>
<p>Mine eye hath play&#8217;d the painter and hath
stell&#8217;d,<br>
Thy beauty&#8217;s form in table of my heart;<br>
My body is the frame wherein &#8217;tis held,<br>
And perspective it is best painter&#8217;s art.<br>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br>
To find where your true image pictur&#8217;d lies,<br>
Which in my bosom&#8217;s shop is hanging still,<br>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<br>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<br>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br>
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,<br>
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.</p>

<p>Let those who are in favour with their stars<br>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br>
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars<br>
Unlook&#8217;d for joy in that I honour most.<br>
Great princes&#8217; favourites their fair leaves spread<br>
But as the marigold at the sun&#8217;s eye,<br>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br>
After a thousand victories once foil&#8217;d,<br>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br>
And all the rest forgot for which he toil&#8217;d:<br>
Then happy I, that love and am belov&#8217;d,<br>
Where I may not remove nor be remov&#8217;d.</p>

<p>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<br>
To thee I send this written embassage,<br>
To witness duty, not to show my wit:<br>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<br>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br>
In thy soul&#8217;s thought, all naked, will bestow it:<br>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving,<br>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect,<br>
And puts apparel on my tatter&#8217;d loving,<br>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<br>
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<br>
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.</p>

<p>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br>
The dear respose for limbs with travel tir&#8217;d;<br>
But then begins a journey in my head<br>
To work my mind, when body&#8217;s work&#8217;s expired:<br>
For then my thoughts&#8212;from far where I abide&#8212;<br>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see:<br>
Save that my soul&#8217;s imaginary sight<br>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br>
Which, like a jewel (hung in ghastly night,<br>
Makes black night beauteous, and her old face new.<br>
Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br>
For thee, and for myself, no quiet find.</p>

<p>How can I then return in happy plight,<br>
That am debarre&#8217;d the benefit of rest?<br>
When day&#8217;s oppression is not eas&#8217;d by night,<br>
But day by night and night by day oppress&#8217;d,<br>
And each, though enemies to either&#8217;s reign,<br>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me,<br>

Which from Love&#8217;s fire took heat perpetual,<br>
Growing a bath and healthful remedy,<br>
For men diseas&#8217;d; but I, my mistress&#8217; thrall,<br>
Came there for cure and this by that I prove,<br>
Love&#8217;s fire heats water, water cools not love.</p>
