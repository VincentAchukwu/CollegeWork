<h4>Scene I. Milan. An abbey.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Eglamour</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Eglamour</p>
<p class="speech">The sun begins to gild the western sky;<br>
And now it is about the very hour<br>
That Silvia, at Friar Patrick&#8217;s cell, should meet me.<br>
She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,<br>
Unless it be to come before their time;<br>
So much they spur their expedition.<br>
See where she comes.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Silvia</span></p>
<p class="speech">Lady, a happy evening!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,<br>
Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:<br>
I fear I am attended by some spies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Eglamour</p>
<p class="speech">Fear not: the forest is not three leagues
off;<br>
If we recover that, we are sure enough.</p>

<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Thurio, Proteus, and
Julia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, I find her milder than she was;<br>
And yet she takes exceptions at your person.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">What, that my leg is too long?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">No; that it is too little.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll wear a boot, to make it somewhat
rounder.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> But love will
not be spurr&#8217;d to what
it loathes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">What says she to my face?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">She says it is a fair one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,<br>
Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> &#8217;Tis
true; such pearls as put out
ladies&#8217; eyes;
For I had rather wink than look on them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">How likes she my discourse?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Ill, when you talk of war.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">But well, when I discourse of love and peace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> But better,
indeed, when you hold your peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">What says she to my valour?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> She needs not,
when she knows it cowardice.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">What says she to my birth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That you are well derived.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> True; from a
gentleman to a fool.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Considers she my possessions?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">O, ay; and pities them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Wherefore?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> That such an
ass should owe them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">That they are out by lease.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes the duke.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!<br>
Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Not I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Nor I.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Saw you my daughter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Neither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Why then,<br>
She&#8217;s fled unto that peasant Valentine;<br>
And Eglamour is in her company.<br>
&#8217;Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,<br>
As he in penance wander&#8217;d through the forest;<br>
Him he knew well, and guess&#8217;d that it was she,<br>
But, being mask&#8217;d, he was not sure of it;<br>
Besides, she did intend confession<br>
At Patrick&#8217;s cell this even; and there she was not;<br>
These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.<br>
Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,<br>
But mount you presently and meet with me<br>
Upon the rising of the mountain-foot<br>
That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:<br>
Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,<br>
That flies her fortune when it follows her.<br>
I&#8217;ll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour<br>
Than for the love of reckless Silvia.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">And I will follow, more for Silvia&#8217;s
love<br>
Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And I will follow, more to cross that love<br>
Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.</p>

Silvia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come,<br>
Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">A thousand more mischances than this one<br>
Have learn&#8217;d me how to brook this patiently.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Come, bring her away.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Where is the gentleman that was with her?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,<br>
But Moyses and Valerius follow him.<br>
Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;<br>
There is our captain: we&#8217;ll follow him that&#8217;s fled;<br>
The thicket is beset; he cannot &#8217;scape.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Outlaw</p>
<p class="speech">Come, I must bring you to our captain&#8217;s
cave:<br>
Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,<br>
And will not use a woman lawlessly.</p>

<h4>Scene IV. Another part of the forest.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Valentine</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">How use doth breed a habit in a man!<br>
This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,<br>
I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:<br>
Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,<br>
And to the nightingale&#8217;s complaining notes<br>
Tune my distresses and record my woes.<br>
O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,<br>
Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,<br>
Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall<br>
And leave no memory of what it was!<br>
Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;<br>
Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!<br>
What halloing and what stir is this to-day?<br>
These are my mates, that make their wills their law,<br>
Have some unhappy passenger in chase.<br>
They love me well; yet I have much to do<br>
To keep them from uncivil outrages.<br>
Withdraw thee, Valentine: who&#8217;s this comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Proteus, Silvia, and
Julia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, this service I have done for you,<br>
Though you respect not aught your servant doth,<br>
To hazard life and rescue you from him<br>
That would have forced your honour and your love;<br>
Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;<br>
A smaller boon than this I cannot beg<br>
And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How like a
dream is this I see and hear!<br>
Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O miserable, unhappy that I am!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;<br>
But by my coming I have made you happy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And me, when
he approacheth to your presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">Had I been seized by a hungry lion,<br>
I would have been a breakfast to the beast,<br>
Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.<br>
O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,<br>
Whose life&#8217;s as tender to me as my soul!<br>
And full as much, for more there cannot be,<br>
I do detest false perjured Proteus.<br>
Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">What dangerous action, stood it next to
death,<br>
Would I not undergo for one calm look!<br>
O, &#8217;tis the curse in love, and still approved,<br>
When women cannot love where they&#8217;re beloved!</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">When Proteus cannot love where he&#8217;s
beloved.<br>
Read over Julia&#8217;s heart, thy first best love,<br>
For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith<br>
Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths<br>
Descended into perjury, to love me.<br>
Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou&#8217;dst two;<br>
And that&#8217;s far worse than none; better have none<br>
Than plural faith which is too much by one:<br>
Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">In love<br>
Who respects friend?</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">All men but Proteus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words<br>
Can no way change you to a milder form,<br>
I&#8217;ll woo you like a soldier, at arms&#8217; end,<br>
And love you &#8217;gainst the nature of love,&#8212;force ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Silvia</p>
<p class="speech">O heaven!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I&#8217;ll force thee yield to my
desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,<br>
Thou friend of an ill fashion!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Valentine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Thou common friend, that&#8217;s without faith or
love,<br>
For such is a friend now; treacherous man!<br>
Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye<br>
Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say<br>
I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.<br>
Who should be trusted, when one&#8217;s own right hand<br>
Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,<br>
I am sorry I must never trust thee more,<br>
But count the world a stranger for thy sake.<br>
The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,<br>
&#8217;Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">My shame and guilt confounds me.<br>
Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow<br>
Be a sufficient ransom for offence,<br>
I tender &#8217;t here; I do as truly suffer<br>
As e&#8217;er I did commit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Then I am paid;<br>
And once again I do receive thee honest.<br>
Who by repentance is not satisfied<br>
Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.<br>
By penitence the Eternal&#8217;s wrath&#8217;s appeased:<br>
And, that my love may appear plain and free,<br>
All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">O me unhappy!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Swoons</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Look to the boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what&#8217;s the
matter?<br>
Look up; speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a
ring
to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Where is that ring, boy?</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Here &#8217;tis; this is it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">How! let me see:<br>
Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:<br>
This is the ring you sent to Silvia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">But how camest thou by this ring? At my
depart<br>
I gave this unto Julia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And Julia herself did give it me;<br>
And Julia herself hath brought it hither.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">How! Julia!</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,<br>
And entertain&#8217;d &#8217;em deeply in her heart.<br>
How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!<br>
O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!<br>
Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me<br>
Such an immodest raiment, if shame live<br>
In a disguise of love:<br>
It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,<br>
Women to change their shapes than men their minds.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Than men their minds! &#8217;tis true.<br>
O heaven! were man<br>
But constant, he were perfect. That one error<br>
Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:<br>
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.<br>
What is in Silvia&#8217;s face, but I may spy<br>
More fresh in Julia&#8217;s with a constant eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Come, come, a hand from either:<br>
Let me be blest to make this happy close;<br>
&#8217;Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Proteus</p>
<p class="speech">Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for
ever.</p>
<p class="speaker">Julia</p>
<p class="speech">And I mine.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Outlaws, with Duke and
Thurio</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Outlaws</p>
<p class="speech">A prize, a prize, a prize!</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the
duke.<br>
Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,<br>
Banished Valentine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Valentine!</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia&#8217;s mine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;<br>
Come not within the measure of my wrath;<br>
Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,<br>
Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;<br>
Take but possession of her with a touch:<br>
I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Thurio</p>
<p class="speech">Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;<br>
I hold him but a fool that will endanger<br>
His body for a girl that loves him not:<br>
I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">The more degenerate and base art thou,<br>
To make such means for her as thou hast done<br>
And leave her on such slight conditions.<br>
Now, by the honour of my ancestry,<br>
I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,<br>
And think thee worthy of an empress&#8217; love:<br>
Know then, I here forget all former griefs,<br>
Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,<br>
Plead a new state in thy unrivall&#8217;d merit,<br>
To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,<br>
Thou art a gentleman and well derived;<br>
Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I thank your grace; the gift hath made me
happy.<br>
I now beseech you, for your daughter&#8217;s sake,<br>
To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">I grant it, for thine own, whate&#8217;er it
be.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">These banish&#8217;d men that I have kept
withal<br>
Are men endued with worthy qualities:<br>
Forgive them what they have committed here<br>
And let them be recall&#8217;d from their exile:<br>
They are reformed, civil, full of good<br>
And fit for great employment, worthy lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">Thou hast prevail&#8217;d; I pardon them and
thee:<br>
Dispose of them as thou know&#8217;st their deserts.<br>
Come, let us go: we will include all jars<br>
With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">And, as we walk along, I dare be bold<br>
With our discourse to make your grace to smile.<br>
What think you of this page, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">I think the boy hath grace in him; he
blushes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke</p>
<p class="speech">What mean you by that saying?</p>
<p class="speaker">Valentine</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, I&#8217;ll tell you as we pass
along,<br>
That you will wonder what hath fortuned.<br>
Come, Proteus; &#8217;tis your penance but to hear<br>
The story of your loves discovered:<br>
That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;<br>
One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.</p>
