<h4>Scene I. A room in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Claudius, Queen
Gertrude, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s matter in these sighs, these
profound heaves:<br>
You must translate: &#8217;tis fit we understand them.<br>
Where is your son?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Bestow this place on us a little while.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speech">Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend<br>
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,<br>
Behind the arras hearing something stir,<br>
Whips out his rapier, cries, &#8216;A rat, a rat!&#8217;<br>
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills<br>
The unseen good old man.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O heavy deed!<br>
It had been so with us, had we been there:<br>
His liberty is full of threats to all;<br>
To you yourself, to us, to every one.<br>
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer&#8217;d?<br>
It will be laid to us, whose providence<br>
Should have kept short, restrain&#8217;d and out of haunt,<br>
This mad young man: but so much was our love,<br>
We would not understand what was most fit;<br>
But, like the owner of a foul disease,<br>
To keep it from divulging, let it feed<br>
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">To draw apart the body he hath kill&#8217;d:<br>
O&#8217;er whom his very madness, like some ore<br>
Among a mineral of metals base,<br>
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O Gertrude, come away!<br>
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,<br>
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed<br>
We must, with all our majesty and skill,<br>
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speech">Friends both, go join you with some further
aid:<br>
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,<br>
And from his mother&#8217;s closet hath he dragg&#8217;d him:<br>
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body<br>
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speech">Come, Gertrude, we&#8217;ll call up our wisest
friends;<br>
And let them know, both what we mean to do,<br>
And what&#8217;s untimely done. O, come away!<br>
My soul is full of discord and dismay.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Another room in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hamlet</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Safely stowed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p> and
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Within]</span> Hamlet! Lord
Hamlet!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">What noise? who calls on Hamlet?<br>
O, here they come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">What have you done, my lord, with the dead
body?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Compounded it with dust, whereto &#8217;tis
kin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Tell us where &#8217;tis, that we may take it
thence<br>
And bear it to the chapel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Do not believe it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Believe what?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">That I can keep your counsel and not mine
own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Take you me for a sponge, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir, that soaks up the king&#8217;s
countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">I understand you not, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and
go
with us to the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">The body is with the king, but the king is not
with
the body. The king is a thing&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Guildenstern</p>
<p class="speech">A thing, my lord!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all
after.</p>

<h4>Scene III. Another room in the castle.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Claudius,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">I have sent to seek him, and to find the
body.<br>
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!<br>
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:<br>
He&#8217;s loved of the distracted multitude,<br>
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;<br>
And where tis so, the offender&#8217;s scourge is
weigh&#8217;d,<br>
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,<br>
This sudden sending him away must seem<br>
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown<br>
By desperate appliance are relieved,<br>
Or not at all.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Rosencrantz</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now! what hath befall&#8217;n?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Where the dead body is bestow&#8217;d, my
lord,<br>
We cannot get from him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">But where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Without, my lord; guarded, to know your
pleasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Bring him before us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Hamlet and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Now, Hamlet, where&#8217;s Polonius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">At supper.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">At supper! where?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a
certain
convocation of politic worms are e&#8217;en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that&#8217;s the end.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Alas, alas!</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of
a
king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">What dost you mean by this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Where is Polonius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">In heaven; send hither to see: if your
messenger
find him not there, seek him i&#8217; the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Go seek him there.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To some Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">He will stay till ye come.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Attendants</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial
safety,&#8212;<br>
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve<br>
For that which thou hast done,&#8212;must send thee hence<br>
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;<br>
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,<br>
The associates tend, and every thing is bent<br>
For England.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;For England!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Hamlet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Good.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">So is it, if thou knew&#8217;st our purposes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for<br>
England! Farewell, dear mother.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Thy loving father, Hamlet.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">My mother: father and mother is man and wife;
man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed
aboard;<br>
Delay it not; I&#8217;ll have him hence to-night:<br>
Away! for every thing is seal&#8217;d and done<br>
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, England, if my love thou hold&#8217;st at
aught&#8212;<br>
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,<br>
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red<br>
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe<br>
Pays homage to us&#8212;thou mayst not coldly set<br>
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,<br>
By letters congruing to that effect,<br>
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;<br>
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,<br>
And thou must cure me: till I know &#8217;tis done,<br>
Howe&#8217;er my haps, my joys were ne&#8217;er begun.</p>

Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras<br>
Craves the conveyance of a promised march<br>
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.<br>
If that his majesty would aught with us,<br>
We shall express our duty in his eye;<br>

<p class="speech">Good sir, whose powers are these?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">They are of Norway, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">How purposed, sir, I pray you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Against some part of Poland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Who commands them, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,<br>
Or for some frontier?</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Truly to speak, and with no addition,<br>
We go to gain a little patch of ground<br>
That hath in it no profit but the name.<br>
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;<br>
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole<br>
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then the Polack never will defend it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, it is already garrison&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats<br>
Will not debate the question of this straw:<br>
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,<br>
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without<br>
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Captain</p>
<p class="speech">God be wi&#8217; you, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Rosencrantz</p>
<p class="speech">Wilt please you go, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">Hamlet</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll be with you straight go a little
before.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except
Hamlet</span></p>
<p class="speech">How all occasions do inform against me,<br>
And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,<br>
If his chief good and market of his time<br>
Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.<br>
Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,<br>
Looking before and after, gave us not<br>
That capability and god-like reason<br>
To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be<br>
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple<br>
Of thinking too precisely on the event,<br>
A thought which, quarter&#8217;d, hath but one part wisdom<br>
And ever three parts coward, I do not know<br>
Why yet I live to say &#8216;This thing&#8217;s to do;&#8217;<br>
Sith I have cause and will and strength and means<br>
To do&#8217;t. Examples gross as earth exhort me:<br>
Witness this army of such mass and charge<br>
Led by a delicate and tender prince,<br>
Whose spirit with divine ambition puff&#8217;d<br>
Makes mouths at the invisible event,<br>
Exposing what is mortal and unsure<br>
To all that fortune, death and danger dare,<br>
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great<br>
Is not to stir without great argument,<br>
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw<br>
When honour&#8217;s at the stake. How stand I then,<br>
That have a father kill&#8217;d, a mother stain&#8217;d,<br>
Excitements of my reason and my blood,<br>
And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see<br>
The imminent death of twenty thousand men,<br>
That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,<br>
Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot<br>
Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,<br>
Which is not tomb enough and continent<br>
To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,<br>
My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!</p>

Her mood will needs be pitied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Gertrude</p>
<p class="speech">What would she have?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">She speaks much of her father; says she hears<br>
There&#8217;s tricks i&#8217; the world; and hems, and beats her
heart;<br>
Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,<br>
That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,<br>
Yet the unshaped use of it doth move<br>
The hearers to collection; they aim at it,<br>
And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;<br>
Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
yield them,<br>
Indeed would make one think there might be thought,<br>
Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Horatio</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere good she were spoken with; for she

Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.</p>

springs<br>
All from her father&#8217;s death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,<br>
When sorrows come, they come not single spies<br>
But in battalions. First, her father slain:<br>
Next, your son gone; and he most violent author<br>
Of his own just remove: the people muddied,<br>
Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,<br>
For good Polonius&#8217; death; and we have done but greenly,<br>
In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia<br>
Divided from herself and her fair judgment,<br>
Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:<br>
Last, and as much containing as all these,<br>
Her brother is in secret come from France;<br>
Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,<br>
And wants not buzzers to infect his ear<br>
With pestilent speeches of his father&#8217;s death;<br>
Wherein necessity, of matter beggar&#8217;d,<br>
Will nothing stick our person to arraign<br>
In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,<br>
Like to a murdering-piece, in many places<br>
Gives me superfluous death.</p>

Antiquity forgot, custom not known,<br>

&#8216;Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
this, give these fellows some means to the king:
they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
course for England: of them I have much to tell
thee. Farewell.<br></p>

&#8216;He that thou knowest thine, Hamlet.&#8217;<br>
Come, I will make you way for these your letters;<br>

<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Now must your conscience my acquaintance
seal,<br>
And you must put me in your heart for friend,<br>
Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,<br>
That he which hath your noble father slain<br>
Pursued my life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;It well appears: but tell me<br>
Why you proceeded not against these feats,<br>
So crimeful and so capital in nature,<br>
As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,<br>
You mainly were stirr&#8217;d up.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">O, for two special reasons;<br>
Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew&#8217;d,<br>
But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother<br>
Lives almost by his looks; and for myself&#8212;<br>
My virtue or my plague, be it either which&#8212;<br>
She&#8217;s so conjunctive to my life and soul,<br>
That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,<br>
I could not but by her. The other motive,<br>
Why to a public count I might not go,<br>
Is the great love the general gender bear him;<br>
Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,<br>
Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,<br>
Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,<br>
Too slightly timber&#8217;d for so loud a wind,<br>
Would have reverted to my bow again,<br>
And not where I had aim&#8217;d them.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">And so have I a noble father lost;<br>
A sister driven into desperate terms,<br>
Whose worth, if praises may go back again,<br>
Stood challenger on mount of all the age<br>
For her perfections: but my revenge will come.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Break not your sleeps for that: you must not
think<br>
That we are made of stuff so flat and dull<br>
That we can let our beard be shook with danger<br>
And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:<br>
I loved your father, and we love ourself;<br>

They were given me by Claudio; he received them<br>
Of him that brought them.</p>

&#8216;High and mighty, You shall know I am set
naked on
your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
and more strange return. &#8216;Hamlet.&#8217;<br></p>
<p class="speech">
What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?<br>
Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Know you the hand?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis Hamlets character. &#8216;Naked!<br>
And in a postscript here, he says &#8216;alone.&#8217;<br>
Can you advise me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;m lost in it, my lord. But let him
come;<br>
It warms the very sickness in my heart,<br>
That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,<br>
&#8216;Thus didest thou.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">If it be so, Laertes&#8212;<br>
As how should it be so? how otherwise?&#8212;<br>
Will you be ruled by me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord;<br>
So you will not o&#8217;errule me to a peace.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">To thine own peace. If he be now
return&#8217;d,<br>
As checking at his voyage, and that he means<br>
No more to undertake it, I will work him<br>
To an exploit, now ripe in my device,<br>
Under the which he shall not choose but fall:<br>
And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,<br>
But even his mother shall uncharge the practise<br>
And call it accident.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I will be ruled;<br>
The rather, if you could devise it so<br>
That I might be the organ.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">It falls right.<br>
You have been talk&#8217;d of since your travel much,<br>
And that in Hamlet&#8217;s hearing, for a quality<br>
Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts<br>
Did not together pluck such envy from him<br>
As did that one, and that, in my regard,<br>
Of the unworthiest siege.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">What part is that, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">A very riband in the cap of youth,<br>
Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes<br>
The light and careless livery that it wears<br>
Than settled age his sables and his weeds,<br>
Importing health and graveness. Two months since,<br>
Here was a gentleman of Normandy:&#8212;<br>
I&#8217;ve seen myself, and served against, the French,<br>
And they can well on horseback: but this gallant<br>
Had witchcraft in&#8217;t; he grew unto his seat;<br>
And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,<br>
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured<br>
With the brave beast: so far he topp&#8217;d my thought,<br>
That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,<br>
Come short of what he did.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">A Norman was&#8217;t?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">A Norman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Upon my life, Lamond.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">The very same.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I know him well: he is the brooch indeed<br>
And gem of all the nation.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">He made confession of you,<br>
And gave you such a masterly report<br>
For art and exercise in your defence<br>
And for your rapier most especially,<br>
That he cried out, &#8217;twould be a sight indeed,<br>
If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,<br>
He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,<br>
If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his<br>
Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy<br>
That he could nothing do but wish and beg<br>
Your sudden coming o&#8217;er, to play with him.<br>
Now, out of this,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">What out of this, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Laertes, was your father dear to you?<br>
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,<br>
A face without a heart?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">Why ask you this?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">Not that I think you did not love your
father;<br>
But that I know love is begun by time;<br>
And that I see, in passages of proof,<br>
Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.<br>
There lives within the very flame of love<br>
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;<br>
And nothing is at a like goodness still;<br>
For goodness, growing to a plurisy,<br>
Dies in his own too much: that we would do<br>
We should do when we would; for this &#8216;would&#8217;
changes<br>
And hath abatements and delays as many<br>
As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;<br>
And then this &#8216;should&#8217; is like a spendthrift sigh,<br>
That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o&#8217; the
ulcer:&#8212;<br>
Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,<br>
To show yourself your father&#8217;s son in deed<br>
More than in words?</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">To cut his throat i&#8217; the church.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;<br>
Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,<br>
Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.<br>
Hamlet return&#8217;d shall know you are come home:<br>
We&#8217;ll put on those shall praise your excellence<br>
And set a double varnish on the fame<br>
The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together<br>
And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,<br>
Most generous and free from all contriving,<br>
Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,<br>
Or with a little shuffling, you may choose<br>
A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise<br>
Requite him for your father.</p>
<p class="speaker">Laertes</p>
<p class="speech">I will do&#8217;t:<br>
And, for that purpose, I&#8217;ll anoint my sword.<br>
I bought an unction of a mountebank,<br>
So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,<br>
Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,<br>
Collected from all simples that have virtue<br>
Under the moon, can save the thing from death<br>
That is but scratch&#8217;d withal: I&#8217;ll touch my point<br>
With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,<br>
It may be death.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Claudius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Let&#8217;s further think of
this;<br>
Weigh what convenience both of time and means<br>
May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,<br>
And that our drift look through our bad performance,<br>
&#8217;Twere better not assay&#8217;d: therefore this project<br>
Should have a back or second, that might hold,<br>
If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:<br>
We&#8217;ll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha&#8217;t.<br>
When in your motion you are hot and dry&#8212;<br>
As make your bouts more violent to that end&#8212;<br>
And that he calls for drink, I&#8217;ll have prepared him<br>
A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,<br>
If he by chance escape your venom&#8217;d stuck,<br>
Our purpose may hold there.</p>

There with fantastic garlands did she come<br>
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br>
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br>
But our cold maids do dead men&#8217;s fingers call them:<br>
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br>
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br>
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br>
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br>
As one incapable of her own distress,<br>
Or like a creature native and indued<br>
Unto that element: but long it could not be<br>
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br>
Pull&#8217;d the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br>
To muddy death.</p>
