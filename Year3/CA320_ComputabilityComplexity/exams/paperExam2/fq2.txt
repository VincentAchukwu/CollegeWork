Below are the TM situations in order of the computations:
1. (e, q0, a, ba)
2. (e, q1, b, ba)
3. (b, q0, b, a)
4. (b, q1, a, a)
5. (ba, q0, a, e)
6. (ba, q1, b, e)
7. (bab, q0, #, e)
8. (bab, q1, #, e)

Turing Machines have no finals state(s) and therefore, they accept strings by 
halting after a finite number of moves and no rule is applicable for the last 
entered state (i.e. there is no rule for state q1 and current symbol being #, 
so it halts)
