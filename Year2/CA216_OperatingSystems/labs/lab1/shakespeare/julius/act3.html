The ides of March are come.</p>
<p class="speaker">Soothsayer</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Caesar; but not gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Artemidorus</p>
<p class="speech">Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Trebonius doth desire you to o&#8217;erread,<br>
At your best leisure, this his humble suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Artemidorus</p>
<p class="speech">O Caesar, read mine first; for mine&#8217;s a
suit<br>
That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What touches us ourself shall be last served.</p>
<p class="speaker">Artemidorus</p>
<p class="speech">Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What, is the fellow mad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Publius</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, give place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">What, urge you your petitions in the street?<br>
Come to the Capitol.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Caesar goes up to the
Senate-House, the rest following</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Popilius</p>
<p class="speech">I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">What enterprise, Popilius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Popilius</p>
<p class="speech">Fare you well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Advances to Caesar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What said Popilius Lena?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">He wish&#8217;d to-day our enterprise might
thrive.<br>
I fear our purpose is discovered.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.<br>
Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,<br>
Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,<br>
For I will slay myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Cassius, be constant:<br>
Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;<br>
For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Trebonius knows his time; for, look you,
Brutus.<br>
He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Antony and
Trebonius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,<br>
And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">He is address&#8217;d: press near and second
him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">Casca, you are the first that rears your
hand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Are we all ready? What is now amiss<br>
That Caesar and his senate must redress?</p>
<p class="speaker">Metellus Cimber</p>
<p class="speech">Most high, most mighty, and most puissant
Caesar,<br>
Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat<br>
An humble heart,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Kneeling</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I must prevent thee, Cimber.<br>
These couchings and these lowly courtesies<br>
Might fire the blood of ordinary men,<br>
And turn pre-ordinance and first decree<br>
Into the law of children. Be not fond,<br>
To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood<br>
That will be thaw&#8217;d from the true quality<br>
With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,<br>
Low-crooked court&#8217;sies and base spaniel-fawning.<br>
Thy brother by decree is banished:<br>
If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,<br>
I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.<br>
Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause<br>
Will he be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Metellus Cimber</p>
<p class="speech">Is there no voice more worthy than my own<br>
To sound more sweetly in great Caesar&#8217;s ear<br>
For the repealing of my banish&#8217;d brother?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;<br>
Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may<br>
Have an immediate freedom of repeal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">What, Brutus!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:<br>
As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,<br>
To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I could be well moved, if I were as you:<br>
If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:<br>
But I am constant as the northern star,<br>
Of whose true-fix&#8217;d and resting quality<br>
There is no fellow in the firmament.<br>
The skies are painted with unnumber&#8217;d sparks,<br>
They are all fire and every one doth shine,<br>
But there&#8217;s but one in all doth hold his place:<br>
So in the world; &#8217;tis furnish&#8217;d well with men,<br>
And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;<br>
Yet in the number I do know but one<br>
That unassailable holds on his rank,<br>
Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,<br>
Let me a little show it, even in this;<br>
That I was constant Cimber should be banish&#8217;d,<br>
And constant do remain to keep him so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">O Caesar,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Hence! wilt thou lift up
Olympus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Great Caesar,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Speak, hands for me!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Casca first, then the other
Conspirators and Brutus stab Caesar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Caesar</p>
<p class="speech">Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dies</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!<br>
Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Some to the common pulpits, and cry out<br>
&#8216;Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">People and senators, be not affrighted;<br>
Fly not; stand stiff: ambition&#8217;s debt is paid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Casca</p>
<p class="speech">Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">And Cassius too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Where&#8217;s Publius?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cinna</p>
<p class="speech">Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.</p>
<p class="speaker">Metellus Cimber</p>
<p class="speech">Stand fast together, lest some friend of
Caesar&#8217;s<br>
Should chance&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;<br>
There is no harm intended to your person,<br>
Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,<br>
Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Do so: and let no man abide this deed,<br>
But we the doers.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Trebonius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Where is Antony?</p>
<p class="speaker">Trebonius</p>
<p class="speech">Fled to his house amazed:<br>
Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run<br>
As it were doomsday.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Fates, we will know your pleasures:<br>
That we shall die, we know; &#8217;tis but the time<br>
And drawing days out, that men stand upon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life<br>
Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Grant that, and then is death a benefit:<br>
So are we Caesar&#8217;s friends, that have abridged<br>
His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,<br>
And let us bathe our hands in Caesar&#8217;s blood<br>
Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:<br>
Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,<br>
And, waving our red weapons o&#8217;er our heads,<br>
Let&#8217;s all cry &#8216;Peace, freedom and liberty!&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence<br>
Shall this our lofty scene be acted over<br>
In states unborn and accents yet unknown!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<br>
That now on Pompey&#8217;s basis lies along<br>
No worthier than the dust!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">So oft as that shall be,<br>
So often shall the knot of us be call&#8217;d<br>
The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Decius Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">What, shall we forth?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, every man away:<br>
Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels<br>
With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Soft! who comes here? A friend of
Antony&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:<br>
Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;<br>
And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:<br>
Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;<br>
Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:<br>
Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;<br>
Say I fear&#8217;d Caesar, honour&#8217;d him and loved him.<br>
If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony<br>
May safely come to him, and be resolved<br>
How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,<br>
Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead<br>
So well as Brutus living; but will follow<br>
The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus<br>
Thorough the hazards of this untrod state<br>
With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;<br>
I never thought him worse.<br>
Tell him, so please him come unto this place,<br>
He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,<br>
Depart untouch&#8217;d.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I&#8217;ll fetch him presently.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">I know that we shall have him well to friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I wish we may: but yet have I a mind<br>
That fears him much; and my misgiving still<br>
Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">But here comes Antony.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Antony</span></p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?<br>
Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,<br>
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.<br>
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,<br>
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:<br>
If I myself, there is no hour so fit<br>
As Caesar&#8217;s death hour, nor no instrument<br>
Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich<br>
With the most noble blood of all this world.<br>
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,<br>
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,<br>
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,<br>
I shall not find myself so apt to die:<br>
No place will please me so, no mean of death,<br>
As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,<br>
The choice and master spirits of this age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">O Antony, beg not your death of us.<br>
Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,<br>
As, by our hands and this our present act,<br>
You see we do, yet see you but our hands<br>
And this the bleeding business they have done:<br>
Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;<br>
And pity to the general wrong of Rome&#8212;<br>
As fire drives out fire, so pity pity&#8212;<br>
Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,<br>
To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:<br>
Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts<br>
Of brothers&#8217; temper, do receive you in<br>
With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Your voice shall be as strong as any
man&#8217;s<br>
In the disposing of new dignities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Only be patient till we have appeased<br>
The multitude, beside themselves with fear,<br>
And then we will deliver you the cause,<br>
Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,<br>
Have thus proceeded.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">I doubt not of your wisdom.<br>
Let each man render me his bloody hand:<br>
First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;<br>
Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;<br>
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;<br>
Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;<br>
Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.<br>
Gentlemen all,&#8212;alas, what shall I say?<br>
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,<br>
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,<br>
Either a coward or a flatterer.<br>
That I did love thee, Caesar, O, &#8217;tis true:<br>
If then thy spirit look upon us now,<br>
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,<br>
To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,<br>
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,<br>
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?<br>
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,<br>
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,<br>
It would become me better than to close<br>
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.<br>
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay&#8217;d, brave hart;<br>
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,<br>
Sign&#8217;d in thy spoil, and crimson&#8217;d in thy lethe.<br>
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;<br>
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.<br>
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,<br>
Dost thou here lie!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Mark Antony,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Pardon me, Caius Cassius:<br>
The enemies of Caesar shall say this;<br>
Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I blame you not for praising Caesar so;<br>
But what compact mean you to have with us?<br>
Will you be prick&#8217;d in number of our friends;<br>
Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,<br>
Sway&#8217;d from the point, by looking down on Caesar.<br>
Friends am I with you all and love you all,<br>
Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons<br>
Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Or else were this a savage spectacle:<br>
Our reasons are so full of good regard<br>
That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,<br>
You should be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s all I seek:<br>
And am moreover suitor that I may<br>
Produce his body to the market-place;<br>
And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,<br>
Speak in the order of his funeral.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">You shall, Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">Brutus, a word with you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside to Brutus</span></p>
<p class="speech">You know not what you do: do not consent<br>
That Antony speak in his funeral:<br>
Know you how much the people may be moved<br>
By that which he will utter?</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">By your pardon;<br>
I will myself into the pulpit first,<br>
And show the reason of our Caesar&#8217;s death:<br>
What Antony shall speak, I will protest<br>
He speaks by leave and by permission,<br>
And that we are contented Caesar shall<br>
Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.<br>
It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cassius</p>
<p class="speech">I know not what may fall; I like it not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar&#8217;s
body.<br>
You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,<br>
But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,<br>
And say you do&#8217;t by our permission;<br>
Else shall you not have any hand at all<br>
About his funeral: and you shall speak<br>
In the same pulpit whereto I am going,<br>
After my speech is ended.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Be it so.<br>
I do desire no more.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Prepare the body then, and follow us.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Antony</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,<br>
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!<br>
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man<br>
That ever lived in the tide of times.<br>
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!<br>
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,&#8212;<br>
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,<br>
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue&#8212;<br>
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;<br>
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife<br>
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;<br>
Blood and destruction shall be so in use<br>
And dreadful objects so familiar<br>
That mothers shall but smile when they behold<br>
Their infants quarter&#8217;d with the hands of war;<br>
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:<br>
And Caesar&#8217;s spirit, ranging for revenge,<br>
With Ate by his side come hot from hell,<br>
Shall in these confines with a monarch&#8217;s voice<br>
Cry &#8216;Havoc,&#8217; and let slip the dogs of war;<br>
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth<br>
With carrion men, groaning for burial.</p>

<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.<br>
Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,<br>

Began to water. Is thy master coming?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">He lies to-night within seven leagues of
Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Post back with speed, and tell him what hath
chanced:<br>
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,<br>
No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;<br>
Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;<br>
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse<br>
Into the market-place: there shall I try<br>
In my oration, how the people take<br>
The cruel issue of these bloody men;<br>
According to the which, thou shalt discourse<br>
To young Octavius of the state of things.<br>
Lend me your hand.</p>

Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
Caesar&#8217;s, to him I say, that Brutus&#8217; love to Caesar
was no less than his. If then that friend demand
why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
&#8212;Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">None, Brutus, none.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Then none have I offended. I have done no more
to
Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
enforced, for which he suffered death.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Antony and others, with
Caesar&#8217;s body</span></p>
<p class="speech">Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony:
who,
though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
the benefit of his dying, a place in the
commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
I depart,&#8212;that, as I slew my best lover for the
good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
when it shall please my country to need my death.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Live, Brutus! live, live!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Bring him with triumph home unto his house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Give him a statue with his ancestors.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Let him be Caesar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Caesar&#8217;s better parts<br>
Shall be crown&#8217;d in Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll bring him to his house<br>
With shouts and clamours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">My countrymen,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Brutus</p>
<p class="speech">Good countrymen, let me depart alone,<br>
And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:<br>
Do grace to Caesar&#8217;s corpse, and grace his speech<br>
Tending to Caesar&#8217;s glories; which Mark Antony,<br>
By our permission, is allow&#8217;d to make.<br>
I do entreat you, not a man depart,<br>
Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Let him go up into the public chair;<br>
We&#8217;ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">For Brutus&#8217; sake, I am beholding to
you.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Goes into the
pulpit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">What does he say of Brutus?</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">He says, for Brutus&#8217; sake,<br>
He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus
here.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, that&#8217;s certain:<br>
We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You gentle Romans,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho! let us hear him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your
ears;<br>
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.<br>
The evil that men do lives after them;<br>
The good is oft interred with their bones;<br>
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus<br>
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:<br>
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,<br>
And grievously hath Caesar answer&#8217;d it.<br>
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest&#8212;<br>
For Brutus is an honourable man;<br>
So are they all, all honourable men&#8212;<br>
Come I to speak in Caesar&#8217;s funeral.<br>
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:<br>
But Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
He hath brought many captives home to Rome<br>
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:<br>
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?<br>
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:<br>
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And Brutus is an honourable man.<br>
You all did see that on the Lupercal<br>
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,<br>
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?<br>
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;<br>
And, sure, he is an honourable man.<br>
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,<br>
But here I am to speak what I do know.<br>
You all did love him once, not without cause:<br>
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?<br>
O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,<br>
And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;<br>
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,<br>
And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If thou consider rightly of the matter,<br>
Caesar has had great wrong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Has he, masters?<br>
I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Mark&#8217;d ye his words? He would not take the
crown;<br>
Therefore &#8217;tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with
weeping.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s not a nobler man in Rome than
Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">But yesterday the word of Caesar might<br>
Have stood against the world; now lies he there.<br>
And none so poor to do him reverence.<br>
O masters, if I were disposed to stir<br>
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,<br>
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,<br>
Who, you all know, are honourable men:<br>
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose<br>
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,<br>
Than I will wrong such honourable men.<br>
But here&#8217;s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;<br>
I found it in his closet, &#8217;tis his will:<br>
Let but the commons hear this testament&#8212;<br>
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read&#8212;<br>
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar&#8217;s wounds<br>
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,<br>
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,<br>
And, dying, mention it within their wills,<br>
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy<br>
Unto their issue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll hear the will: read it, Mark
Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">The will, the will! we will hear Caesar&#8217;s
will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read
it;<br>
It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.<br>
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;<br>
And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,<br>
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:<br>
&#8217;Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;<br>
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Read the will; we&#8217;ll hear it, Antony;<br>
You shall read us the will, Caesar&#8217;s will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?<br>
I have o&#8217;ershot myself to tell you of it:<br>
I fear I wrong the honourable men<br>
Whose daggers have stabb&#8217;d Caesar; I do fear it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">They were traitors: honourable men!</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">The will! the testament!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">They were villains, murderers: the will! read the
will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">You will compel me, then, to read the will?<br>
Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,<br>
And let me show you him that made the will.<br>
Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?</p>
<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Come down.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Descend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">You shall have leave.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Antony comes down</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">A ring; stand round.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Room for Antony, most noble Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Several Citizens</p>
<p class="speech">Stand back; room; bear back.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.<br>
You all do know this mantle: I remember<br>
The first time ever Caesar put it on;<br>
&#8217;Twas on a summer&#8217;s evening, in his tent,<br>
That day he overcame the Nervii:<br>
Look, in this place ran Cassius&#8217; dagger through:<br>
See what a rent the envious Casca made:<br>
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb&#8217;d;<br>
And as he pluck&#8217;d his cursed steel away,<br>
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow&#8217;d it,<br>
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved<br>
If Brutus so unkindly knock&#8217;d, or no;<br>
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar&#8217;s angel:<br>
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!<br>
This was the most unkindest cut of all;<br>
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,<br>
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors&#8217; arms,<br>
Quite vanquish&#8217;d him: then burst his mighty heart;<br>
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,<br>
Even at the base of Pompey&#8217;s statua,<br>
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.<br>
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!<br>
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,<br>
Whilst bloody treason flourish&#8217;d over us.<br>
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel<br>
The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.<br>
Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold<br>
Our Caesar&#8217;s vesture wounded? Look you here,<br>
Here is himself, marr&#8217;d, as you see, with traitors.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O piteous spectacle!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O noble Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O woful day!</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O traitors, villains!</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O most bloody sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We will be revenged.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!<br>
Let not a traitor live!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Stay, countrymen.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Peace there! hear the noble Antony.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll hear him, we&#8217;ll follow him,
we&#8217;ll die with him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you
up<br>
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.<br>
They that have done this deed are honourable:<br>
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,<br>
That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,<br>
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.<br>
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:<br>
I am no orator, as Brutus is;<br>
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,<br>
That love my friend; and that they know full well<br>
That gave me public leave to speak of him:<br>
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,<br>
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,<br>
To stir men&#8217;s blood: I only speak right on;<br>
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;<br>
Show you sweet Caesar&#8217;s wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,<br>
And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,<br>
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony<br>
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue<br>
In every wound of Caesar that should move<br>
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll mutiny.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">We&#8217;ll burn the house of Brutus.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:<br>
Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?<br>
Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:<br>
You have forgot the will I told you of.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Most true. The will! Let&#8217;s stay and hear
the will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Here is the will, and under Caesar&#8217;s
seal.<br>
To every Roman citizen he gives,<br>
To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Most noble Caesar! We&#8217;ll revenge his
death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">O royal Caesar!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Hear me with patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">All</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, ho!</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,<br>
His private arbours and new-planted orchards,<br>
On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,<br>
And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,<br>
To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.<br>
Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Never, never. Come, away, away!<br>
We&#8217;ll burn his body in the holy place,<br>
And with the brands fire the traitors&#8217; houses.<br>
Take up the body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Go fetch fire.</p>
<p class="speaker">Third Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Pluck down benches.</p>
<p class="speaker">Fourth Citizen</p>
<p class="speech">Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt Citizens with the
body</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,<br>
Take thou what course thou wilt!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Servant</span></p>
<p class="speech">How now, fellow!</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Where is he?</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">He and Lepidus are at Caesar&#8217;s house.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">And thither will I straight to visit him:<br>
He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,<br>
And in this mood will give us any thing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Servant</p>
<p class="speech">I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius<br>
Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.</p>
<p class="speaker">Antony</p>
<p class="speech">Belike they had some notice of the people,<br>
How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.</p>
