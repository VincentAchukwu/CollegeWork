<h4>Scene I. London. Queen Katharine&#8217;s apartments.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Queen Katharine and her
Women, as at work</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with
troubles;<br>
Sing, and disperse &#8217;em, if thou canst: leave working.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Song</span></p>
<p class="speech">Orpheus with his lute made trees,<br>
And the mountain tops that freeze,<br>
Bow themselves when he did sing:<br>
To his music plants and flowers<br>
Ever sprung; as sun and showers<br>
There had made a lasting spring.<br>
Every thing that heard him play,<br>
Even the billows of the sea,<br>
Hung their heads, and then lay by.<br>
In sweet music is such art,<br>
Killing care and grief of heart<br>
Fall asleep, or hearing, die.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">How now!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">An&#8217;t please your grace, the two great
cardinals<br>
Wait in the presence.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Would they speak with me?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">They will&#8217;d me say so, madam.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Pray their graces<br>
To come near.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speech">What can be their business<br>
With me, a poor weak woman, fall&#8217;n from favour?<br>
I do not like their coming. Now I think on&#8217;t,<br>
They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:<br>
But all hoods make not monks.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cardinal Wolsey and
Cardinal Campeius</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Peace to your highness!</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Your graces find me here part of a housewife,<br>
I would be all, against the worst may happen.<br>
What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">May it please you noble madam, to withdraw<br>
Into your private chamber, we shall give you<br>
The full cause of our coming.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Speak it here:<br>
There&#8217;s nothing I have done yet, o&#8217; my conscience,<br>
Deserves a corner: would all other women<br>
Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!<br>
My lords, I care not, so much I am happy<br>
Above a number, if my actions<br>
Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw &#8217;em,<br>
Envy and base opinion set against &#8217;em,<br>
I know my life so even. If your business<br>
Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,<br>
Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina
serenissima,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">O, good my lord, no Latin;<br>
I am not such a truant since my coming,<br>
As not to know the language I have lived in:<br>
A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,
suspicious;<br>
Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,<br>
If you speak truth, for their poor mistress&#8217; sake;<br>
Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,<br>
The willing&#8217;st sin I ever yet committed<br>
May be absolved in English.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Noble lady,<br>
I am sorry my integrity should breed,<br>
And service to his majesty and you,<br>
So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.<br>
We come not by the way of accusation,<br>
To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,<br>
Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,<br>
You have too much, good lady; but to know<br>
How you stand minded in the weighty difference<br>
Between the king and you; and to deliver,<br>
Like free and honest men, our just opinions<br>
And comforts to your cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">Most honour&#8217;d madam,<br>
My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,<br>
Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,<br>
Forgetting, like a good man your late censure<br>
Both of his truth and him, which was too far,<br>
Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,<br>
His service and his counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> To betray
me.&#8212;<br>
My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;<br>
Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!<br>
But how to make ye suddenly an answer,<br>
In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,&#8212;<br>
More near my life, I fear,&#8212;with my weak wit,<br>
And to such men of gravity and learning,<br>
In truth, I know not. I was set at work<br>
Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking<br>
Either for such men or such business.<br>
For her sake that I have been,&#8212;for I feel<br>
The last fit of my greatness,&#8212;good your graces,<br>
Let me have time and counsel for my cause:<br>
Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, you wrong the king&#8217;s love with these
fears:<br>
Your hopes and friends are infinite.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">In England<br>
But little for my profit: can you think, lords,<br>
That any Englishman dare give me counsel?<br>
Or be a known friend, &#8217;gainst his highness&#8217;
pleasure,<br>
Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,<br>
And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,<br>
They that must weigh out my afflictions,<br>
They that my trust must grow to, live not here:<br>
They are, as all my other comforts, far hence<br>
In mine own country, lords.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">I would your grace<br>
Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">How, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">Put your main cause into the king&#8217;s
protection;<br>
He&#8217;s loving and most gracious: &#8217;twill be much<br>
Both for your honour better and your cause;<br>
For if the trial of the law o&#8217;ertake ye,<br>
You&#8217;ll part away disgraced.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">He tells you rightly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Ye tell me what ye wish for both,&#8212;my
ruin:<br>
Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!<br>
Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge<br>
That no king can corrupt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">Your rage mistakes us.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,<br>
Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;<br>
But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:<br>
Mend &#8217;em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?<br>
The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,<br>
A woman lost among ye, laugh&#8217;d at, scorn&#8217;d?<br>
I will not wish ye half my miseries;<br>
I have more charity: but say, I warn&#8217;d ye;<br>
Take heed, for heaven&#8217;s sake, take heed, lest at once<br>
The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, this is a mere distraction;<br>
You turn the good we offer into envy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye<br>
And all such false professors! would you have me&#8212;<br>
If you have any justice, any pity;<br>
If ye be any thing but churchmen&#8217;s habits&#8212;<br>
Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?<br>
Alas, has banish&#8217;d me his bed already,<br>
His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,<br>
And all the fellowship I hold now with him<br>
Is only my obedience. What can happen<br>
To me above this wretchedness? all your studies<br>
Make me a curse like this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">Your fears are worse.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Have I lived thus long&#8212;let me speak
myself,<br>
Since virtue finds no friends&#8212;a wife, a true one?<br>
A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,<br>
Never yet branded with suspicion?<br>
Have I with all my full affections<br>
Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
obey&#8217;d him?<br>
Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?<br>
Almost forgot my prayers to content him?<br>
And am I thus rewarded? &#8217;tis not well, lords.<br>
Bring me a constant woman to her husband,<br>
One that ne&#8217;er dream&#8217;d a joy beyond his pleasure;<br>
And to that woman, when she has done most,<br>
Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,<br>
To give up willingly that noble title<br>
Your master wed me to: nothing but death<br>
Shall e&#8217;er divorce my dignities.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, hear me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Would I had never trod this English earth,<br>
Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!<br>
Ye have angels&#8217; faces, but heaven knows your hearts.<br>
What will become of me now, wretched lady!<br>
I am the most unhappy woman living.<br>
Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!<br>
Shipwreck&#8217;d upon a kingdom, where no pity,<br>
No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;<br>
Almost no grave allow&#8217;d me: like the lily,<br>
That once was mistress of the field and flourish&#8217;d,<br>
I&#8217;ll hang my head and perish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">If your grace<br>
Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,<br>
You&#8217;ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,<br>
Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,<br>
The way of our profession is against it:<br>
We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow &#8217;em.<br>
For goodness&#8217; sake, consider what you do;<br>
How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly<br>
Grow from the king&#8217;s acquaintance, by this carriage.<br>
The hearts of princes kiss obedience,<br>
So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits<br>
They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.<br>
I know you have a gentle, noble temper,<br>
A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us<br>
Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Campeius</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, you&#8217;ll find it so. You wrong your
virtues<br>
With these weak women&#8217;s fears: a noble spirit,<br>
As yours was put into you, ever casts<br>
Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;<br>
Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please<br>
To trust us in your business, we are ready<br>
To use our utmost studies in your service.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Katharine</p>
<p class="speech">Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive
me,<br>
If I have used myself unmannerly;<br>
You know I am a woman, lacking wit<br>
To make a seemly answer to such persons.<br>
Pray, do my service to his majesty:<br>
He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers<br>
While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,<br>
Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,<br>
That little thought, when she set footing here,<br>
She should have bought her dignities so dear.</p>

Surrey, and Chamberlain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">If you will now unite in your complaints,<br>
And force them with a constancy, the cardinal<br>
Cannot stand under them: if you omit<br>
The offer of this time, I cannot promise<br>
But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,<br>
With these you bear already.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">I am joyful<br>
To meet the least occasion that may give me<br>
Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,<br>
To be revenged on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Which of the peers<br>
Have uncontemn&#8217;d gone by him, or at least<br>
Strangely neglected? when did he regard<br>
The stamp of nobleness in any person<br>
Out of himself?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;My lords, you speak your
pleasures:<br>
What he deserves of you and me I know;<br>
What we can do to him, though now the time<br>
Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot<br>
Bar his access to the king, never attempt<br>
Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft<br>
Over the king in&#8217;s tongue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">O, fear him not;<br>
His spell in that is out: the king hath found<br>
Matter against him that for ever mars<br>
The honey of his language. No, he&#8217;s settled,<br>
Not to come off, in his displeasure.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
I should be glad to hear such news as this<br>
Once every hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Believe it, this is true:<br>
In the divorce his contrary proceedings<br>
Are all unfolded wherein he appears<br>
As I would wish mine enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">How came<br>
His practises to light?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Most strangely.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">O, how, how?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">The cardinal&#8217;s letters to the pope
miscarried,<br>
And came to the eye o&#8217; the king: wherein was read,<br>
How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness<br>
To stay the judgment o&#8217; the divorce; for if<br>
It did take place, &#8216;I do,&#8217; quoth he,
&#8216;perceive<br>
My king is tangled in affection to<br>
A creature of the queen&#8217;s, Lady Anne Bullen.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Has the king this?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Believe it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Will this work?</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">The king in this perceives him, how he coasts<br>
And hedges his own way. But in this point<br>
All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic<br>
After his patient&#8217;s death: the king already<br>
Hath married the fair lady.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Would he had!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">May you be happy in your wish, my lord<br>
For, I profess, you have it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Now, all my joy<br>
Trace the conjunction!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">My amen to&#8217;t!</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">All men&#8217;s!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">There&#8217;s order given for her coronation:<br>
Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left<br>
To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,<br>
She is a gallant creature, and complete<br>
In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her<br>
Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall<br>
In it be memorised.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">But, will the king<br>
Digest this letter of the cardinal&#8217;s?<br>
The Lord forbid!</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Marry, amen!</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">No, no;<br>
There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose<br>
Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius<br>
Is stol&#8217;n away to Rome; hath ta&#8217;en no leave;<br>
Has left the cause o&#8217; the king unhandled; and<br>
Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,<br>
To second all his plot. I do assure you<br>
The king cried Ha! at this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">Now, God incense him,<br>
And let him cry Ha! louder!</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">But, my lord,<br>
When returns Cranmer?</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">He is return&#8217;d in his opinions; which<br>
Have satisfied the king for his divorce,<br>
Together with all famous colleges<br>
Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,<br>
His second marriage shall be publish&#8217;d, and<br>
Her coronation. Katharine no more<br>
Shall be call&#8217;d queen, but princess dowager<br>
And widow to Prince Arthur.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">This same Cranmer&#8217;s<br>
A worthy fellow, and hath ta&#8217;en much pain<br>
In the king&#8217;s business.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>

For it an archbishop.</p>

To come abroad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>

No, we&#8217;ll no Bullens. Speedily I wish<br>

And well deserving? yet I know her for<br>
A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to<br>
Our cause, that she should lie i&#8217; the bosom of<br>
Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up<br>

To his own portion! and what expense by the hour<br>

Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,<br>
Saw you the cardinal?</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, we have<br>
Stood here observing him: some strange commotion<br>
Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;<br>
Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,<br>
Then lays his finger on his temple, straight<br>
Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,<br>
Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts<br>
His eye against the moon: in most strange postures<br>
We have seen him set himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">It may well be;<br>
There is a mutiny in&#8217;s mind. This morning<br>
Papers of state he sent me to peruse,<br>
As I required: and wot you what I found<br>
There,&#8212;on my conscience, put unwittingly?<br>
Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;<br>
The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,<br>
Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which<br>
I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks<br>
Possession of a subject.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>

And fix&#8217;d on spiritual object, he should still<br>
Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid<br>
His thinkings are below the moon, not worth<br>
His serious considering.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">King Henry VIII takes his
seat; whispers Lovell, who goes to Cardinal Wolsey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Heaven forgive me!<br>
Ever God bless your highness!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">Good my lord,<br>
You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory<br>
Of your best graces in your mind; the which<br>
You were now running o&#8217;er: you have scarce time<br>
To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span<br>
To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that<br>
I deem you an ill husband, and am glad<br>
To have you therein my companion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Sir,<br>
For holy offices I have a time; a time<br>
To think upon the part of business which<br>
I bear i&#8217; the state; and nature does require<br>
Her times of preservation, which perforce<br>
I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,<br>
Must give my tendence to.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">You have said well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">And ever may your highness yoke together,<br>
As I will lend you cause, my doing well<br>
With my well saying!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis well said again;<br>
And &#8217;tis a kind of good deed to say well:<br>
And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:<br>
His said he did; and with his deed did crown<br>
His word upon you. Since I had my office,<br>
I have kept you next my heart; have not alone<br>
Employ&#8217;d you where high profits might come home,<br>
But pared my present havings, to bestow<br>
My bounties upon you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> What should
this mean?</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> The Lord
increase this business!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">Have I not made you,<br>
The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,<br>
If what I now pronounce you have found true:<br>
And, if you may confess it, say withal,<br>
If you are bound to us or no. What say you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,<br>
Shower&#8217;d on me daily, have been more than could<br>
My studied purposes requite; which went<br>
Beyond all man&#8217;s endeavours: my endeavours<br>
Have ever come too short of my desires,<br>
Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends<br>
Have been mine so that evermore they pointed<br>
To the good of your most sacred person and<br>
The profit of the state. For your great graces<br>
Heap&#8217;d upon me, poor undeserver, I<br>
Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,<br>
My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,<br>
Which ever has and ever shall be growing,<br>
Till death, that winter, kill it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">Fairly answer&#8217;d;<br>
A loyal and obedient subject is<br>
Therein illustrated: the honour of it<br>
Does pay the act of it; as, i&#8217; the contrary,<br>
The foulness is the punishment. I presume<br>
That, as my hand has open&#8217;d bounty to you,<br>
My heart dropp&#8217;d love, my power rain&#8217;d honour, more<br>
On you than any; so your hand and heart,<br>
Your brain, and every function of your power,<br>
Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,<br>
As &#8217;twere in love&#8217;s particular, be more<br>
To me, your friend, than any.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">I do profess<br>
That for your highness&#8217; good I ever labour&#8217;d<br>
More than mine own; that am, have, and will be&#8212;<br>
Though all the world should crack their duty to you,<br>
And throw it from their soul; though perils did<br>
Abound, as thick as thought could make &#8217;em, and<br>
Appear in forms more horrid,&#8212;yet my duty,<br>
As doth a rock against the chiding flood,<br>
Should the approach of this wild river break,<br>
And stand unshaken yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VIII</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis nobly spoken:<br>
Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,<br>
For you have seen him open&#8217;t. Read o&#8217;er this;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving him papers</span></p>
<p class="speech">And after, this: and then to breakfast with<br>
What appetite you have.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit King Henry VIII,
frowning upon Cardinal Wolsey: the Nobles throng after him, smiling
and whispering</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">What should this mean?<br>
What sudden anger&#8217;s this? how have I reap&#8217;d it?<br>
He parted frowning from me, as if ruin<br>
Leap&#8217;d from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion<br>
Upon the daring huntsman that has gall&#8217;d him;<br>
Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;<br>
I fear, the story of his anger. &#8217;Tis so;<br>
This paper has undone me: &#8217;tis the account<br>
Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together<br>
For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,<br>
And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!<br>
Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil<br>
Made me put this main secret in the packet<br>
I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?<br>
No new device to beat this from his brains?<br>
I know &#8217;twill stir him strongly; yet I know<br>
A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune<br>
Will bring me off again. What&#8217;s this? &#8216;To the
Pope!&#8217;<br>
The letter, as I live, with all the business<br>
I writ to&#8217;s holiness. Nay then, farewell!<br>
I have touch&#8217;d the highest point of all my greatness;<br>
And, from that full meridian of my glory,<br>
I haste now to my setting: I shall fall<br>
Like a bright exhalation m the evening,<br>
And no man see me more.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter to Cardinal Wolsey,
Norfolk and Suffolk, Surrey, and the Chamberlain</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Hear the king&#8217;s pleasure, cardinal: who
commands you<br>
To render up the great seal presently<br>
Into our hands; and to confine yourself<br>
To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester&#8217;s,<br>
Till you hear further from his highness.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Stay:<br>
Where&#8217;s your commission, lords? words cannot carry<br>
Authority so weighty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Who dare cross &#8217;em,<br>
Bearing the king&#8217;s will from his mouth expressly?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Till I find more than will or words to do it,<br>
I mean your malice, know, officious lords,<br>
I dare and must deny it. Now I feel<br>
Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:<br>
How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,<br>
As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton<br>
Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!<br>
Follow your envious courses, men of malice;<br>
You have Christian warrant for &#8217;em, and, no doubt,<br>
In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,<br>
You ask with such a violence, the king,<br>
Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;<br>
Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,<br>
During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,<br>
Tied it by letters-patents: now, who&#8217;ll take it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">The king, that gave it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">It must be himself, then.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Thou art a proud traitor, priest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Proud lord, thou liest:<br>
Within these forty hours Surrey durst better<br>
Have burnt that tongue than said so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Thy ambition,<br>
Thou scarlet sin, robb&#8217;d this bewailing land<br>
Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:<br>
The heads of all thy brother cardinals,<br>
With thee and all thy best parts bound together,<br>
Weigh&#8217;d not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!<br>
You sent me deputy for Ireland;<br>
Far from his succor, from the king, from all<br>
That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;<br>
Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,<br>
Absolved him with an axe.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">This, and all else<br>
This talking lord can lay upon my credit,<br>
I answer is most false. The duke by law<br>
Found his deserts: how innocent I was<br>
From any private malice in his end,<br>
His noble jury and foul cause can witness.<br>
If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you<br>
You have as little honesty as honour,<br>
That in the way of loyalty and truth<br>
Toward the king, my ever royal master,<br>
Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,<br>
And all that love his follies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">By my soul,<br>
Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou
shouldst feel<br>
My sword i&#8217; the life-blood of thee else. My lords,<br>
Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?<br>
And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,<br>
To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,<br>
Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,<br>
And dare us with his cap like larks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">All goodness<br>
Is poison to thy stomach.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, that goodness<br>
Of gleaning all the land&#8217;s wealth into one,<br>
Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;<br>
The goodness of your intercepted packets<br>
You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,<br>
Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.<br>
My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,<br>
As you respect the common good, the state<br>
Of our despised nobility, our issues,<br>
Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,<br>
Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles<br>
Collected from his life. I&#8217;ll startle you<br>
Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench<br>
Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">How much, methinks, I could despise this man,<br>
But that I am bound in charity against it!</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Those articles, my lord, are in the king&#8217;s
hand:<br>
But, thus much, they are foul ones.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">So much fairer<br>
And spotless shall mine innocence arise,<br>
When the king knows my truth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">This cannot save you:<br>
I thank my memory, I yet remember<br>
Some of these articles; and out they shall.<br>
Now, if you can blush and cry &#8216;guilty,&#8217; cardinal,<br>
You&#8217;ll show a little honesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Speak on, sir;<br>
I dare your worst objections: if I blush,<br>
It is to see a nobleman want manners.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">I had rather want those than my head. Have at
you!<br>
First, that, without the king&#8217;s assent or knowledge,<br>
You wrought to be a legate; by which power<br>
You maim&#8217;d the jurisdiction of all bishops.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else<br>
To foreign princes, &#8216;Ego et Rex meus&#8217;<br>
Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king<br>
To be your servant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Then that, without the knowledge<br>
Either of king or council, when you went<br>
Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold<br>
To carry into Flanders the great seal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Item, you sent a large commission<br>
To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,<br>
Without the king&#8217;s will or the state&#8217;s allowance,<br>
A league between his highness and Ferrara.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">That, out of mere ambition, you have caused<br>
Your holy hat to be stamp&#8217;d on the king&#8217;s coin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Then that you have sent innumerable
substance&#8212;<br>
By what means got, I leave to your own conscience&#8212;<br>
To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways<br>
You have for dignities; to the mere undoing<br>
Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;<br>
Which, since they are of you, and odious,<br>
I will not taint my mouth with.</p>
<p class="speaker">Chamberlain</p>
<p class="speech">O my lord,<br>
Press not a falling man too far! &#8217;tis virtue:<br>
His faults lie open to the laws; let them,<br>
Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him<br>
So little of his great self.</p>
<p class="speaker">Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">I forgive him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Suffolk</p>
<p class="speech">Lord cardinal, the king&#8217;s further pleasure
is,<br>
Because all those things you have done of late,<br>
By your power legatine, within this kingdom,<br>
Fall into the compass of a praemunire,<br>
That therefore such a writ be sued against you;<br>
To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,<br>
Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be<br>
Out of the king&#8217;s protection. This is my charge.</p>
<p class="speaker">Norfolk</p>
<p class="speech">And so we&#8217;ll leave you to your
meditations<br>
How to live better. For your stubborn answer<br>
About the giving back the great seal to us,<br>
The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.<br>
So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Cardinal
Wolsey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">So farewell to the little good you bear me.<br>
Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!<br>
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth<br>
The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,<br>
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;<br>
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,<br>
And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely<br>
His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,<br>
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,<br>
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,<br>
This many summers in a sea of glory,<br>
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride<br>
At length broke under me and now has left me,<br>
Weary and old with service, to the mercy<br>
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.<br>
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:<br>
I feel my heart new open&#8217;d. O, how wretched<br>
Is that poor man that hangs on princes&#8217; favours!<br>
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,<br>
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,<br>
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:<br>
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,<br>
Never to hope again.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Cromwell, and stands
amazed</span></p>
<p class="speech">Why, how now, Cromwell!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">I have no power to speak, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">What, amazed<br>
At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder<br>
A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,<br>
I am fall&#8217;n indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">How does your grace?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, well;<br>
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.<br>
I know myself now; and I feel within me<br>
A peace above all earthly dignities,<br>
A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,<br>
I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,<br>
These ruin&#8217;d pillars, out of pity, taken<br>
A load would sink a navy, too much honour:<br>
O, &#8217;tis a burthen, Cromwell, &#8217;tis a burthen<br>
Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">I am glad your grace has made that right use of
it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,<br>
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,<br>
To endure more miseries and greater far<br>
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.<br>
What news abroad?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;The heaviest and the worst<br>
Is your displeasure with the king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">God bless him!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen<br>
Lord chancellor in your place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s somewhat sudden:<br>
But he&#8217;s a learned man. May he continue<br>
Long in his highness&#8217; favour, and do justice<br>
For truth&#8217;s sake and his conscience; that his bones,<br>
When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,<br>
May have a tomb of orphans&#8217; tears wept on em! What more?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">That Cranmer is return&#8217;d with welcome,<br>
Install&#8217;d lord archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s news indeed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">Last, that the Lady Anne,<br>
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,<br>
This day was view&#8217;d in open as his queen,<br>
Going to chapel; and the voice is now<br>
Only about her coronation.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">There was the weight that pull&#8217;d me down. O
Cromwell,<br>
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories<br>
In that one woman I have lost for ever:<br>
No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,<br>
Or gild again the noble troops that waited<br>
Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;<br>
I am a poor fall&#8217;n man, unworthy now<br>
To be thy lord and master: seek the king;<br>
That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him<br>
What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;<br>
Some little memory of me will stir him&#8212;<br>
I know his noble nature&#8212;not to let<br>
Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,<br>
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide<br>
For thine own future safety.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">O my lord,<br>
Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego<br>
So good, so noble and so true a master?<br>
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,<br>
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.<br>
The king shall have my service: but my prayers<br>
For ever and for ever shall be yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear<br>
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,<br>
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.<br>
Let&#8217;s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;<br>
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,<br>
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention<br>
Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,<br>
Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,<br>
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,<br>
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;<br>
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss&#8217;d it.<br>
Mark but my fall, and that that ruin&#8217;d me.<br>
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:<br>
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,<br>
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?<br>
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;<br>
Corruption wins not more than honesty.<br>
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,<br>
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:<br>
Let all the ends thou aim&#8217;st at be thy country&#8217;s,<br>
Thy God&#8217;s, and truth&#8217;s; then if thou fall&#8217;st,<br>
O Cromwell,<br>
Thou fall&#8217;st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;<br>
And,&#8212;prithee, lead me in:<br>
There take an inventory of all I have,<br>
To the last penny; &#8217;tis the king&#8217;s: my robe,<br>
And my integrity to heaven, is all<br>
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!<br>
Had I but served my God with half the zeal<br>
I served my king, he would not in mine age<br>
Have left me naked to mine enemies.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cromwell</p>
<p class="speech">Good sir, have patience.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cardinal Wolsey</p>
<p class="speech">So I have. Farewell<br>
The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
