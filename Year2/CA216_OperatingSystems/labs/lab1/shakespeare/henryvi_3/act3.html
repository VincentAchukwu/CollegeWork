<h4>Scene I. A forest in the north of England.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter two Keepers, with
cross-bows in their hands</span></p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Under this thick-grown brake we&#8217;ll shroud
ourselves;<br>
For through this laund anon the deer will come;<br>
And in this covert will we make our stand,<br>
Culling the principal of all the deer.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll stay above the hill, so both may
shoot.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow<br>
Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.<br>
Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:<br>
And, for the time shall not seem tedious,<br>
I&#8217;ll tell thee what befell me on a day<br>
In this self-place where now we mean to stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Here comes a man; let&#8217;s stay till he be
past.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Henry VI,
disguised, with a prayerbook</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">From Scotland am I stol&#8217;n, even of pure
love,<br>
To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.<br>
No, Harry, Harry, &#8217;tis no land of thine;<br>
Thy place is fill&#8217;d, thy sceptre wrung from thee,<br>
Thy balm wash&#8217;d off wherewith thou wast anointed:<br>
No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,<br>
No humble suitors press to speak for right,<br>
No, not a man comes for redress of thee;<br>
For how can I help them, and not myself?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, here&#8217;s a deer whose skin&#8217;s a
keeper&#8217;s fee:<br>
This is the quondam king; let&#8217;s seize upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,<br>
For wise men say it is the wisest course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Forbear awhile; we&#8217;ll hear a little
more.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My queen and son are gone to France for aid;<br>
And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick<br>
Is thither gone, to crave the French king&#8217;s sister<br>
To wife for Edward: if this news be true,<br>
Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;<br>
For Warwick is a subtle orator,<br>
And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.<br>
By this account then Margaret may win him;<br>
For she&#8217;s a woman to be pitied much:<br>
Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;<br>
Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;<br>
The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;<br>
And Nero will be tainted with remorse,<br>
To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.<br>
Ay, but she&#8217;s come to beg, Warwick to give;<br>
She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,<br>
He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.<br>
She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;<br>
He smiles, and says his Edward is install&#8217;d;<br>
That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;<br>
Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,<br>
Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,<br>
And in conclusion wins the king from her,<br>
With promise of his sister, and what else,<br>
To strengthen and support King Edward&#8217;s place.<br>
O Margaret, thus &#8217;twill be; and thou, poor soul,<br>
Art then forsaken, as thou went&#8217;st forlorn!</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Say, what art thou that talk&#8217;st of kings
and queens?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">More than I seem, and less than I was born
to:<br>
A man at least, for less I should not be;<br>
And men may talk of kings, and why not I?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but thou talk&#8217;st as if thou wert a
king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, so I am, in mind; and that&#8217;s
enough.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">My crown is in my heart, not on my head;<br>
Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,<br>
Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:<br>
A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Well, if you be a king crown&#8217;d with
content,<br>
Your crown content and you must be contented<br>
To go along with us; for as we think,<br>
You are the king King Edward hath deposed;<br>
And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance<br>
Will apprehend you as his enemy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">But did you never swear, and break an oath?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">No, never such an oath; nor will not now.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Where did you dwell when I was King of
England?</p>
<p class="speaker">Second Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">Here in this country, where we now remain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">I was anointed king at nine months old;<br>
My father and my grandfather were kings,<br>
And you were sworn true subjects unto me:<br>
And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">No;<br>
For we were subjects but while you were king.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?<br>
Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!<br>
Look, as I blow this feather from my face,<br>
And as the air blows it to me again,<br>
Obeying with my wind when I do blow,<br>
And yielding to another when it blows,<br>
Commanded always by the greater gust;<br>
Such is the lightness of you common men.<br>
But do not break your oaths; for of that sin<br>
My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.<br>
Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;<br>
And be you kings, command, and I&#8217;ll obey.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">We are true subjects to the king, King
Edward.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">So would you be again to Henry,<br>
If he were seated as King Edward is.</p>
<p class="speaker">First Keeper</p>
<p class="speech">We charge you, in God&#8217;s name, and the
king&#8217;s,<br>
To go with us unto the officers.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Henry VI</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, lead; your king&#8217;s name
be obey&#8217;d:<br>
And what God will, that let your king perform;<br>
And what he will, I humbly yield unto.</p>

<h4>Scene II. London. The palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Edward IV,
Gloucester, Clarence, and Lady Grey</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban&#8217;s
field<br>
This lady&#8217;s husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,<br>
His lands then seized on by the conqueror:<br>
Her suit is now to repossess those lands;<br>
Which we in justice cannot well deny,<br>
Because in quarrel of the house of York<br>
The worthy gentleman did lose his life.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Your highness shall do well to grant her
suit;<br>
It were dishonour to deny it her.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">It were no less; but yet I&#8217;ll make a
pause.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
Yea, is it so?<br>
I see the lady hath a thing to grant,<br>
Before the king will grant her humble suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
He knows the game: how true
he keeps the wind!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
Silence!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Widow, we will consider of your suit;<br>
And come some other time to know our mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:<br>
May it please your highness to resolve me now;<br>
And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
Ay, widow? then I&#8217;ll warrant
you all your lands,<br>
An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.<br>
Fight closer, or, good faith, you&#8217;ll catch a blow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
I fear her not, unless she
chance to fall.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
God forbid that! for he&#8217;ll
take vantages.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
I think he means to beg a
child of her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
Nay, whip me then: he&#8217;ll rather
give her two.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Three, my most gracious lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
You shall have four, if you&#8217;ll
be ruled by him.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twere pity they should lose their
father&#8217;s lands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, give us leave: I&#8217;ll try this
widow&#8217;s wit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
Ay, good leave have you; for
you will have leave,<br>
Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Gloucester and Clarence
retire</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Now tell me, madam, do you love your
children?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">And would you not do much to do them good?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">To do them good, I would sustain some harm.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Then get your husband&#8217;s lands, to do them
good.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Therefore I came unto your majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll tell you how these lands are to be
got.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">So shall you bind me to your highness&#8217;
service.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">What you command, that rests in me to do.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">But you will take exceptions to my boon.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then I will do what your grace commands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span> He
plies her hard; and much rain
wears the marble.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
As red as fire! nay, then
her wax must melt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">An easy task; &#8217;tis but to love a king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s soon perform&#8217;d, because I am a
subject.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, thy husband&#8217;s lands I freely
give thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">I take my leave with many thousand thanks.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
The match is made; she seals it
with a curtsy.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">But stay thee, &#8217;tis the fruits of love I
mean.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.<br>
What love, think&#8217;st thou, I sue so much to get?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">My love till death, my humble thanks, my
prayers;<br>
That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">But now you partly may perceive my mind.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">My mind will never grant what I perceive<br>
Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">To tell you plain, I had rather lie in
prison.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband&#8217;s
lands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;<br>
For by that loss I will not purchase them.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Therein thou wrong&#8217;st thy children
mightily.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.<br>
But, mighty lord, this merry inclination<br>
Accords not with the sadness of my suit:<br>
Please you dismiss me either with &#8216;ay&#8217; or
&#8216;no.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, if thou wilt say &#8216;ay&#8217; to my
request;<br>
No if thou dost say &#8216;no&#8217; to my demand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
The widow likes him not, she
knits her brows.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
He is the bluntest wooer in<br>
Christendom.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> Her looks do
argue her replete with modesty;<br>
Her words do show her wit incomparable;<br>
All her perfections challenge sovereignty:<br>
One way or other, she is for a king;<br>
And she shall be my love, or else my queen.&#8212;<br>
Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis better said than done, my gracious
lord:<br>
I am a subject fit to jest withal,<br>
But far unfit to be a sovereign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee<br>
I speak no more than what my soul intends;<br>
And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">And that is more than I will yield unto:<br>
I know I am too mean to be your queen,<br>
And yet too good to be your concubine.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lady Grey</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Twill grieve your grace my sons should
call you father.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">No more than when my daughters call thee
mother.<br>
Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;<br>
And, by God&#8217;s mother, I, being but a bachelor,<br>
Have other some: why, &#8217;tis a happy thing<br>
To be the father unto many sons.<br>
Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Clarence]</span>
The ghostly father now hath done
his shrift.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside to Gloucester]</span>
When he was made a shriver,<br>
&#8217;twas for shift.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The widow likes it not, for she looks very
sad.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;ll think it strange if I should marry
her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">To whom, my lord?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Why, Clarence, to myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">That would be ten days&#8217; wonder at the
least.</p>
<p class="speaker">Clarence</p>
<p class="speech">That&#8217;s a day longer than a wonder
lasts.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">By so much is the wonder in extremes.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both<br>
Her suit is granted for her husband&#8217;s lands.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Nobleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Nobleman</p>
<p class="speech">My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,<br>
And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Edward IV</p>
<p class="speech">See that he be convey&#8217;d unto the Tower:<br>
And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,<br>
To question of his apprehension.<br>
Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Gloucester</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, Edward will use women honourably.<br>
Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,<br>
That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,<br>
To cross me from the golden time I look for!<br>
And yet, between my soul&#8217;s desire and me&#8212;<br>
The lustful Edward&#8217;s title buried&#8212;<br>
Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,<br>
And all the unlook&#8217;d for issue of their bodies,<br>
To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:<br>
A cold premeditation for my purpose!<br>
Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;<br>
Like one that stands upon a promontory,<br>
And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,<br>
Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,<br>
And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,<br>
Saying, he&#8217;ll lade it dry to have his way:<br>
So do I wish the crown, being so far off;<br>
And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;<br>
And so I say, I&#8217;ll cut the causes off,<br>
Flattering me with impossibilities.<br>
My eye&#8217;s too quick, my heart o&#8217;erweens too much,<br>
Unless my hand and strength could equal them.<br>
Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;<br>
What other pleasure can the world afford?<br>
I&#8217;ll make my heaven in a lady&#8217;s lap,<br>
And deck my body in gay ornaments,<br>
And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.<br>
O miserable thought! and more unlikely<br>
Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!<br>
Why, love forswore me in my mother&#8217;s womb:<br>
And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,<br>
She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,<br>
To shrink mine arm up like a wither&#8217;d shrub;<br>
To make an envious mountain on my back,<br>
Where sits deformity to mock my body;<br>
To shape my legs of an unequal size;<br>
To disproportion me in every part,<br>
Like to a chaos, or an unlick&#8217;d bear-whelp<br>
That carries no impression like the dam.<br>
And am I then a man to be beloved?<br>
O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!<br>
Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,<br>
But to command, to cheque, to o&#8217;erbear such<br>
As are of better person than myself,<br>
I&#8217;ll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,<br>
And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,<br>
Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head<br>
Be round impaled with a glorious crown.<br>
And yet I know not how to get the crown,<br>
For many lives stand between me and home:<br>
And I,&#8212;like one lost in a thorny wood,<br>
That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,<br>
Seeking a way and straying from the way;<br>
Not knowing how to find the open air,<br>
But toiling desperately to find it out,&#8212;<br>
Torment myself to catch the English crown:<br>
And from that torment I will free myself,<br>
Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.<br>
Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,<br>
And cry &#8216;Content&#8217; to that which grieves my heart,<br>
And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,<br>
And frame my face to all occasions.<br>
I&#8217;ll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;<br>
I&#8217;ll slay more gazers than the basilisk;<br>
I&#8217;ll play the orator as well as Nestor,<br>
Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,<br>
And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.<br>
I can add colours to the chameleon,<br>
Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,<br>
And set the murderous Machiavel to school.<br>
Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?<br>
Tut, were it farther off, I&#8217;ll pluck it down.</p>

<h4>Scene III. France. King Lewis XI&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Flourish. Enter King Lewis
XI, his sister Bona, his Admiral, called Bourbon, Prince Edward,
Queen Margaret, and Oxford. King Lewis XI sits, and riseth up
again</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,<br>
Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state<br>
And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">No, mighty King of France: now Margaret<br>
Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve<br>
Where kings command. I was, I must confess,<br>
Great Albion&#8217;s queen in former golden days:<br>
But now mischance hath trod my title down,<br>
And with dishonour laid me on the ground;<br>
Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,<br>
And to my humble seat conform myself.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep
despair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">From such a cause as fills mine eyes with
tears<br>
And stops my tongue, while heart is drown&#8217;d in cares.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Whate&#8217;er it be, be thou still like
thyself,<br>
And sit thee by our side:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Seats her by him</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yield not thy neck<br>
To fortune&#8217;s yoke, but let thy dauntless mind<br>
Still ride in triumph over all mischance.<br>
Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;<br>
It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Those gracious words revive my drooping
thoughts<br>
And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.<br>
Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,<br>
That Henry, sole possessor of my love,<br>
Is of a king become a banish&#8217;d man,<br>
And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;<br>
While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York<br>
Usurps the regal title and the seat<br>
Of England&#8217;s true-anointed lawful king.<br>
This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,<br>
With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry&#8217;s heir,<br>
Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;<br>
And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:<br>
Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;<br>
Our people and our peers are both misled,<br>
Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,<br>
And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,<br>
While we bethink a means to break it off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">The more I stay, the more I&#8217;ll succor
thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.<br>
And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">What&#8217;s he approacheth boldly to our
presence?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Our Earl of Warwick, Edward&#8217;s greatest
friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to
France?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He descends. She
ariseth</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;<br>
For this is he that moves both wind and tide.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">From worthy Edward, King of Albion,<br>
My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,<br>
I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,<br>
First, to do greetings to thy royal person;<br>
And then to crave a league of amity;<br>
And lastly, to confirm that amity<br>
With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant<br>
That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,<br>
To England&#8217;s king in lawful marriage.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> If that go
forward, Henry&#8217;s hope is done.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Bona]</span> And,
gracious madam, in our king&#8217;s behalf,<br>
I am commanded, with your leave and favour,<br>
Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue<br>
To tell the passion of my sovereign&#8217;s heart;<br>
Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,<br>
Hath placed thy beauty&#8217;s image and thy virtue.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,<br>
Before you answer Warwick. His demand<br>
Springs not from Edward&#8217;s well-meant honest love,<br>
But from deceit bred by necessity;<br>
For how can tyrants safely govern home,<br>
Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?<br>
To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,<br>
That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,<br>
Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry&#8217;s son.<br>
Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage<br>
Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;<br>
For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,<br>
Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Injurious Margaret!</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">And why not queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Because thy father Henry did usurp;<br>
And thou no more are prince than she is queen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,<br>
Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;<br>
And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,<br>
Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;<br>
And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,<br>
Who by his prowess conquered all France:<br>
From these our Henry lineally descends.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth
discourse,<br>
You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost<br>
All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?<br>
Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.<br>
But for the rest, you tell a pedigree<br>
Of threescore and two years; a silly time<br>
To make prescription for a kingdom&#8217;s worth.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy
liege,<br>
Whom thou obeyed&#8217;st thirty and six years,<br>
And not bewray thy treason with a blush?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,<br>
Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?<br>
For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">Call him my king by whose injurious doom<br>
My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,<br>
Was done to death? and more than so, my father,<br>
Even in the downfall of his mellow&#8217;d years,<br>
When nature brought him to the door of death?<br>
No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,<br>
This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And I the house of York.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,<br>
Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,<br>
While I use further conference with Warwick.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They stand aloof</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Heavens grant that Warwick&#8217;s words bewitch
him not!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy
conscience,<br>
Is Edward your true king? for I were loath<br>
To link with him that were not lawful chosen.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">But is he gracious in the people&#8217;s eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">The more that Henry was unfortunate.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then further, all dissembling set aside,<br>
Tell me for truth the measure of his love<br>
Unto our sister Bona.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Such it seems<br>
As may beseem a monarch like himself.<br>
Myself have often heard him say and swear<br>
That this his love was an eternal plant,<br>
Whereof the root was fix&#8217;d in virtue&#8217;s ground,<br>
The leaves and fruit maintain&#8217;d with beauty&#8217;s sun,<br>
Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,<br>
Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speech">Yet I confess that often ere this day,<br>
When I have heard your king&#8217;s desert recounted,<br>
Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be
Edward&#8217;s;<br>
And now forthwith shall articles be drawn<br>
Touching the jointure that your king must make,<br>
Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.<br>
Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness<br>
That Bona shall be wife to the English king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">To Edward, but not to the English king.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device<br>
By this alliance to make void my suit:<br>
Before thy coming Lewis was Henry&#8217;s friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">And still is friend to him and Margaret:<br>
But if your title to the crown be weak,<br>
As may appear by Edward&#8217;s good success,<br>
Then &#8217;tis but reason that I be released<br>
From giving aid which late I promised.<br>
Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand<br>
That your estate requires and mine can yield.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,<br>
Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.<br>
And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,<br>
You have a father able to maintain you;<br>
And better &#8217;twere you troubled him than France.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,<br>
Proud setter up and puller down of kings!<br>
I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,<br>
Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold<br>
Thy sly conveyance and thy lord&#8217;s false love;<br>
For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Post blows a horn
within</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Post</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Post</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Warwick]</span> My lord
ambassador, these letters are for you,<br>
Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To King Lewis XI</span></p>
<p class="speech">These from our king unto your majesty:</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">To Queen Margaret</span></p>
<p class="speech">And, madam, these for you; from whom I know
not.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">They all read their
letters</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Oxford</p>
<p class="speech">I like it well that our fair queen and
mistress<br>
Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were
nettled:<br>
I hope all&#8217;s for the best.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair
queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped
joys.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Mine, full of sorrow and heart&#8217;s
discontent.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">What! has your king married the Lady Grey!<br>
And now, to soothe your forgery and his,<br>
Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?<br>
Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?<br>
Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">I told your majesty as much before:<br>
This proveth Edward&#8217;s love and Warwick&#8217;s honesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of
heaven,<br>
And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,<br>
That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward&#8217;s,<br>
No more my king, for he dishonours me,<br>
But most himself, if he could see his shame.<br>
Did I forget that by the house of York<br>
My father came untimely to his death?<br>
Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?<br>
Did I impale him with the regal crown?<br>
Did I put Henry from his native right?<br>
And am I guerdon&#8217;d at the last with shame?<br>
Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:<br>
And to repair my honour lost for him,<br>
I here renounce him and return to Henry.<br>
My noble queen, let former grudges pass,<br>
And henceforth I am thy true servitor:<br>
I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,<br>
And replant Henry in his former state.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Warwick, these words have turn&#8217;d my hate to
love;<br>
And I forgive and quite forget old faults,<br>
And joy that thou becomest King Henry&#8217;s friend.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,<br>
That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us<br>
With some few bands of chosen soldiers,<br>
I&#8217;ll undertake to land them on our coast<br>
And force the tyrant from his seat by war.<br>
&#8217;Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:<br>
And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,<br>
He&#8217;s very likely now to fall from him,<br>
For matching more for wanton lust than honour,<br>
Or than for strength and safety of our country.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged<br>
But by thy help to this distressed queen?</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,<br>
Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">My quarrel and this English queen&#8217;s are
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">And mine with hers, and thine, and
Margaret&#8217;s.<br>
Therefore at last I firmly am resolved<br>
You shall have aid.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Let me give humble thanks for all at once.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Then, England&#8217;s messenger, return in
post,<br>
And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,<br>
That Lewis of France is sending over masquers<br>
To revel it with him and his new bride:<br>
Thou seest what&#8217;s past, go fear thy king withal.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bona</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him, in hope he&#8217;ll prove a widower
shortly,<br>
I&#8217;ll wear the willow garland for his sake.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,<br>
And I am ready to put armour on.</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,<br>
And therefore I&#8217;ll uncrown him ere&#8217;t be long.<br>
There&#8217;s thy reward: be gone.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Post</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">But, Warwick,<br>
Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,<br>
Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;<br>
And, as occasion serves, this noble queen<br>
And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.<br>
Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,<br>
What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?</p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">This shall assure my constant loyalty,<br>
That if our queen and this young prince agree,<br>
I&#8217;ll join mine eldest daughter and my joy<br>
To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.</p>
<p class="speaker">Queen Margaret</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.<br>
Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,<br>
Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;<br>
And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,<br>
That only Warwick&#8217;s daughter shall be thine.</p>
<p class="speaker">Prince Edward</p>
<p class="speech">Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;<br>
And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He gives his hand to
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Lewis XI</p>
<p class="speech">Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be
levied,<br>
And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,<br>
Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.<br>
I long till Edward fall by war&#8217;s mischance,<br>
For mocking marriage with a dame of France.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but
Warwick</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Warwick</p>
<p class="speech">I came from Edward as ambassador,<br>
But I return his sworn and mortal foe:<br>
Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,<br>
But dreadful war shall answer his demand.<br>
Had he none else to make a stale but me?<br>
Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.<br>
I was the chief that raised him to the crown,<br>
And I&#8217;ll be chief to bring him down again:<br>
Not that I pity Henry&#8217;s misery,<br>
But seek revenge on Edward&#8217;s mockery.</p>
