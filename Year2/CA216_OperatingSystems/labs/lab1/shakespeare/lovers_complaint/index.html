<h3>A Lover&#8217;s Complaint</h3>
<p>From off a hill whose concave womb re-worded<br>
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,<br>
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,<br>
And down I laid to list the sad-tun&#8217;d tale;<br>
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,<br>
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,<br>
Storming her world with sorrow&#8217;s wind and rain.</p>
<p>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,<br>
Which fortified her visage from the sun,<br>
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw<br>
The carcase of a beauty spent and done.<br>
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,<br>
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of Heaven&#8217;s fell rage<br>
Some beauty peeped through lattice of sear&#8217;d age.</p>
<p>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,<br>
Which on it had conceited characters,<br>
Laund&#8217;ring the silken figures in the brine<br>
That season&#8217;d woe had pelleted in tears,<br>
And often reading what contents it bears;<br>
As often shrieking undistinguish&#8217;d woe,<br>
In clamours of all size, both high and low.</p>
<p>Sometimes her levell&#8217;d eyes their carriage ride;<br>
As they did battery to the spheres intend;<br>
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied<br>
To th&#8217; orbed earth; sometimes they do extend<br>
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend<br>
To every place at once, and nowhere fix&#8217;d,<br>
The mind and sight distractedly commix&#8217;d.</p>
<p>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,<br>
Proclaim&#8217;d in her a careless hand of pride;<br>
For some, untuck&#8217;d, descended her sheav&#8217;d hat,<br>
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;<br>
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,<br>
And, true to bondage, would not break from thence,<br>
Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</p>
<p>A thousand favours from a maund she drew<br>
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,<br>
Which one by one she in a river threw,<br>
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;<br>
Like usury applying wet to wet,<br>
Or monarchs&#8217; hands, that lets not bounty fall<br>
Where want cries &#8216;some,&#8217; but where excess begs all.</p>
<p>Of folded schedules had she many a one,<br>
Which she perus&#8217;d, sigh&#8217;d, tore, and gave the
flood;<br>
Crack&#8217;d many a ring of posied gold and bone,<br>
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;<br>
Found yet mo letters sadly penn&#8217;d in blood,<br>
With sleided silk feat and affectedly<br>
Enswath&#8217;d, and seal&#8217;d to curious secrecy.</p>
<p>These often bath&#8217;d she in her fluxive eyes,<br>
And often kiss&#8217;d, and often &#8216;gan to tear;<br>
Cried, &#8216;O false blood, thou register of lies,<br>
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!<br>
Ink would have seem&#8217;d more black and damned here!&#8217;<br>
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,<br>
Big discontent so breaking their contents.</p>
<p>A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh,<br>
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew<br>
Of court, of city, and had let go by<br>
The swiftest hours, observed as they flew,<br>
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew;<br>
And, privileg&#8217;d by age, desires to know<br>
In brief, the grounds and motives of her woe.</p>
<p>So slides he down upon his grained bat,<br>
And comely-distant sits he by her side;<br>
When he again desires her, being sat,<br>
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:<br>
If that from him there may be aught applied<br>
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,<br>
&#8217;Tis promised in the charity of age.</p>
<p>&#8216;Father,&#8217; she says, &#8216;though in me you
behold<br>
The injury of many a blasting hour,<br>
Let it not tell your judgement I am old;<br>
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:<br>
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,<br>
Fresh to myself, if I had self-applied<br>
Love to myself, and to no love beside.</p>
<p>&#8216;But woe is me! too early I attended<br>
A youthful suit (it was to gain my grace)<br>
Of one by nature&#8217;s outwards so commended,<br>
That maiden&#8217;s eyes stuck over all his face:<br>
Love lack&#8217;d a dwelling and made him her place;<br>
And when in his fair parts she did abide,<br>
She was new lodg&#8217;d and newly deified.</p>
<p>&#8216;His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;<br>
And every light occasion of the wind<br>
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.<br>
What&#8217;s sweet to do, to do will aptly find:<br>
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind;<br>
For on his visage was in little drawn,<br>
What largeness thinks in paradise was sawn.</p>
<p>&#8216;Small show of man was yet upon his chin;<br>
His phoenix down began but to appear,<br>
Like unshorn velvet, on that termless skin,<br>
Whose bare out-bragg&#8217;d the web it seemed to wear:<br>
Yet show&#8217;d his visage by that cost more dear;<br>
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt<br>
If best were as it was, or best without.</p>
<p>His qualities were beauteous as his form,<br>
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;<br>
Yet if men mov&#8217;d him, was he such a storm<br>
As oft &#8216;twixt May and April is to see,<br>
When winds breathe sweet, unruly though they be.<br>
His rudeness so with his authoriz&#8217;d youth<br>
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</p>
<p>&#8216;Well could he ride, and often men would say<br>
That horse his mettle from his rider takes:<br>
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,<br>
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!<br>
And controversy hence a question takes,<br>
Whether the horse by him became his deed,<br>
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.</p>
<p>&#8216;But quickly on this side the verdict went;<br>
His real habitude gave life and grace<br>
To appertainings and to ornament,<br>
Accomplish&#8217;d in himself, not in his case,:<br>
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,<br>
Came for additions; yet their purpos&#8217;d trim<br>
Pierc&#8217;d not his grace, but were all grac&#8217;d by him.</p>
<p>&#8216;So on the tip of his subduing tongue<br>
All kind of arguments and question deep,<br>
All replication prompt, and reason strong,<br>
For his advantage still did wake and sleep:<br>
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,<br>
He had the dialect and different skill,<br>
Catching all passions in his craft of will;</p>
<p>&#8216;That he did in the general bosom reign<br>
Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,<br>
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain<br>
In personal duty, following where he haunted:<br>
Consents bewitch&#8217;d, ere he desire, have granted;<br>
And dialogued for him what he would say,<br>
Ask&#8217;d their own wills, and made their wills obey.</p>
<p>&#8216;Many there were that did his picture get,<br>
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;<br>
Like fools that in the imagination set<br>
The goodly objects which abroad they find<br>
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign&#8217;d;<br>
And labouring in mo pleasures to bestow them,<br>
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:</p>
<p>&#8216;So many have, that never touch&#8217;d his hand,<br>
Sweetly suppos&#8217;d them mistress of his heart.<br>
My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,<br>
And was my own fee-simple, (not in part,)<br>
What with his heart in youth, and youth in art,<br>
Threw my affections in his charmed power,<br>
Reserv&#8217;d the stalk, and gave him all my flower.</p>
<p>&#8216;Yet did I not, as some my equals did,<br>
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;<br>
Finding myself in honour so forbid,<br>
With safest distance I mine honour shielded:<br>
Experience for me many bulwarks builded<br>
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain&#8217;d the foil<br>
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</p>
<p>&#8216;But ah! who ever shunn&#8217;d by precedent<br>
The destin&#8217;d ill she must herself assay?<br>
Or force&#8217;d examples, &#8216;gainst her own content,<br>
To put the by-pass&#8217;d perils in her way?<br>
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;<br>
For when we rage, advice is often seen<br>
By blunting us to make our wills more keen.</p>
<p>&#8216;Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,<br>
That we must curb it upon others&#8217; proof,<br>
To be forbod the sweets that seems so good,<br>
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.<br>
O appetite, from judgement stand aloof!<br>
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,<br>
Though reason weep, and cry It is thy last.</p>
<p>&#8216;For further I could say, This man&#8217;s untrue,<br>
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;<br>
Heard where his plants in others&#8217; orchards grew,<br>
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;<br>
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;<br>
Thought characters and words, merely but art,<br>
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</p>
<p>&#8216;And long upon these terms I held my city,<br>
Till thus he &#8216;gan besiege me: Gentle maid,<br>
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,<br>
And be not of my holy vows afraid:<br>
That&#8217;s to you sworn, to none was ever said;<br>
For feasts of love I have been call&#8217;d unto,<br>
Till now did ne&#8217;er invite, nor never woo.</p>
<p>&#8216;All my offences that abroad you see<br>
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;<br>
Love made them not; with acture they may be,<br>
Where neither party is nor true nor kind:<br>
They sought their shame that so their shame did find;<br>
And so much less of shame in me remains,<br>
By how much of me their reproach contains.</p>
<p>&#8216;Among the many that mine eyes have seen,<br>
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm&#8217;d,<br>
Or my affection put to the smallest teen,<br>
Or any of my leisures ever charm&#8217;d:<br>
Harm have I done to them, but ne&#8217;er was harmed;<br>
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,<br>
And reign&#8217;d, commanding in his monarchy.</p>
<p>&#8216;Look here what tributes wounded fancies sent me,<br>
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;<br>
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me<br>
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood<br>
In bloodless white and the encrimson&#8217;d mood;<br>
Effects of terror and dear modesty,<br>
Encamp&#8217;d in hearts, but fighting outwardly.</p>
<p>&#8216;And, lo! behold these talents of their hair,<br>
With twisted metal amorously empleach&#8217;d,<br>
I have receiv&#8217;d from many a several fair,<br>
(Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech&#8217;d,)<br>
With the annexions of fair gems enrich&#8217;d,<br>
And deep-brain&#8217;d sonnets that did amplify<br>
Each stone&#8217;s dear nature, worth, and quality.</p>
<p>&#8216;The diamond, why &#8217;twas beautiful and hard,<br>
Whereto his invis&#8217;d properties did tend;<br>
The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard<br>
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;<br>
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend<br>
With objects manifold; each several stone,<br>
With wit well blazon&#8217;d, smil&#8217;d, or made some moan.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lo! all these trophies of affections hot,<br>
Of pensiv&#8217;d and subdued desires the tender,<br>
Nature hath charg&#8217;d me that I hoard them not,<br>
But yield them up where I myself must render,<br>
That is, to you, my origin and ender:<br>
For these, of force, must your oblations be,<br>
Since I their altar, you enpatron me.</p>
<p>&#8216;O then advance of yours that phraseless hand,<br>
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;<br>
Take all these similes to your own command,<br>
Hallow&#8217;d with sighs that burning lungs did raise;<br>
What me your minister, for you obeys,<br>
Works under you; and to your audit comes<br>
Their distract parcels in combined sums.</p>
<p>&#8216;Lo! this device was sent me from a nun,<br>
Or sister sanctified of holiest note;<br>
Which late her noble suit in court did shun,<br>
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;<br>
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,<br>
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove<br>
To spend her living in eternal love.</p>
<p>&#8216;But O, my sweet, what labour is&#8217;t to leave<br>
The thing we have not, mastering what not strives?<br>
Paling the place which did no form receive,<br>
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves:<br>
She that her fame so to herself contrives,<br>
The scars of battle &#8216;scapeth by the flight,<br>
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</p>
<p>&#8216;O pardon me, in that my boast is true:<br>
The accident which brought me to her eye,<br>
Upon the moment did her force subdue,<br>
And now she would the caged cloister fly:<br>
Religious love put out religion&#8217;s eye:<br>
Not to be tempted, would she be immur&#8217;d,<br>
And now, to tempt all, liberty procur&#8217;d.</p>
<p>&#8216;How mighty then you are, O hear me tell!<br>
The broken bosoms that to me belong<br>
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,<br>
And mine I pour your ocean all among:<br>
I strong o&#8217;er them, and you o&#8217;er me being strong,<br>
Must for your victory us all congest,<br>
As compound love to physic your cold breast.</p>
<p>&#8216;My parts had pow&#8217;r to charm a sacred nun,<br>
Who, disciplin&#8217;d and dieted in grace,<br>
Believ&#8217;d her eyes when they t oassail begun,<br>
All vows and consecrations giving place.<br>
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,<br>
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,<br>
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</p>
<p>&#8216;When thou impressest, what are precepts worth<br>
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,<br>
How coldly those impediments stand forth,<br>
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!<br>
Love&#8217;s arms are peace, &#8216;gainst rule, &#8216;gainst
sense, &#8216;gainst<br>
shame.<br>
And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,<br>
The aloes of all forces, shocks and fears.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,<br>
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine,<br>
And supplicant their sighs to your extend,<br>
To leave the battery that you make &#8216;gainst mine,<br>
Lending soft audience to my sweet design,<br>
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath,<br>
That shall prefer and undertake my troth.</p>
<p>&#8216;This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,<br>
Whose sights till then were levell&#8217;d on my face;<br>
Each cheek a river running from a fount<br>
With brinish current downward flow&#8217;d apace:<br>
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!<br>
Who, glaz&#8217;d with crystal, gate the glowing roses<br>
That flame through water which their hue encloses.</p>
<p>&#8216;O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies<br>
In the small orb of one particular tear!<br>
But with the inundation of the eyes<br>
What rocky heart to water will not wear?<br>
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?<br>
O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,<br>
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</p>
<p>&#8216;For lo! his passion, but an art of craft,<br>
Even there resolv&#8217;d my reason into tears;<br>
There my white stole of chastity I daff&#8217;d,<br>
Shook off my sober guards, and civil fears;<br>
Appear to him, as he to me appears,<br>
All melting; though our drops this difference bore:<br>
His poison&#8217;d me, and mine did him restore.</p>
<p>&#8216;In him a plenitude of subtle matter,<br>
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,<br>
Of burning blushes or of weeping water,<br>
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,<br>
In either&#8217;s aptness, as it best deceives,<br>
To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,<br>
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows;</p>
<p>&#8216;That not a heart which in his level came<br>
Could scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,<br>
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;<br>
And, veil&#8217;d in them, did win whom he would maim:<br>
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;<br>
When he most burned in heart-wish&#8217;d luxury,<br>
He preach&#8217;d pure maid and prais&#8217;d cold chastity.</p>
<p>&#8216;Thus merely with the garment of a Grace<br>
The naked and concealed fiend he cover&#8217;d,<br>
That the unexperienc&#8217;d gave the tempter place,<br>
Which, like a cherubin, above them hover&#8217;d.<br>
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover&#8217;d?<br>
Ay me! I fell, and yet do question make<br>
What I should do again for such a sake.</p>
<p>&#8216;O, that infected moisture of his eye,<br>
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow&#8217;d,<br>
O, that forc&#8217;d thunder from his heart did fly,<br>
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow&#8217;d,<br>
O, all that borrow&#8217;d motion, seeming ow&#8217;d,<br>
Would yet again betray the fore-betray&#8217;d,<br>
And new pervert a reconciled maid.&#8217;</p>
