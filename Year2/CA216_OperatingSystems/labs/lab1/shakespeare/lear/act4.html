<h4>Scene I. The heath.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Edgar</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Yet better thus, and known to be
contemn&#8217;d,<br>
Than still contemn&#8217;d and flatter&#8217;d. To be worst,<br>
The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,<br>
Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:<br>
The lamentable change is from the best;<br>
The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,<br>
Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!<br>
The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst<br>
Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester, led by an
Old Man</span></p>
<p class="speech">My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!<br>
But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,<br>
Lie would not yield to age.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
your father&#8217;s tenant, these fourscore years.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:<br>
Thy comforts can do me no good at all;<br>
Thee they may hurt.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;<br>
I stumbled when I saw: full oft &#8217;tis seen,<br>
Our means secure us, and our mere defects<br>
Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,<br>
The food of thy abused father&#8217;s wrath!<br>
Might I but live to see thee in my touch,<br>
I&#8217;ld say I had eyes again!</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">How now! Who&#8217;s there?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> O gods! Who
is&#8217;t can say &#8216;I am at
the worst&#8217;?
I am worse than e&#8217;er I was.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis poor mad Tom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And worse I
may be yet: the worst is not<br>
So long as we can say &#8216;This is the worst.&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">Fellow, where goest?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Is it a beggar-man?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">Madman and beggar too.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">He has some reason, else he could not beg.<br>
I&#8217; the last night&#8217;s storm I such a fellow saw;<br>
Which made me think a man a worm: my son<br>
Came then into my mind; and yet my mind<br>
Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
more since.<br>
As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.<br>
They kill us for their sport.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> How should
this be?<br>
Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,<br>
Angering itself and others.&#8212;Bless thee, master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Is that the naked fellow?</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my
sake,<br>
Thou wilt o&#8217;ertake us, hence a mile or twain,<br>
I&#8217; the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;<br>
And bring some covering for this naked soul,<br>
Who I&#8217;ll entreat to lead me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, sir, he is mad.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis the times&#8217; plague, when madmen
lead the blind.<br>
Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;<br>
Above the rest, be gone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Old Man</p>
<p class="speech">I&#8217;ll bring him the best &#8217;parel that I
have,<br>
Come on&#8217;t what will.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Sirrah, naked fellow,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Poor Tom&#8217;s a-cold.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Aside</span></p>
<p class="speech">I cannot daub it further.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Come hither, fellow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> And yet I
must.&#8212;Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Know&#8217;st thou the way to Dover?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path.
Poor
Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
thee, good man&#8217;s son, from the foul fiend! five
fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Here, take this purse, thou whom the
heavens&#8217; plagues<br>
Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched<br>
Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!<br>
Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,<br>
That slaves your ordinance, that will not see<br>
Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;<br>
So distribution should undo excess,<br>
And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, master.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">There is a cliff, whose high and bending head<br>
Looks fearfully in the confined deep:<br>
Bring me but to the very brim of it,<br>
And I&#8217;ll repair the misery thou dost bear<br>
With something rich about me: from that place<br>
I shall no leading need.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Give me thy arm:<br>
Poor Tom shall lead thee.</p>

<h4>Scene II. Before Albany&#8217;s palace.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Goneril and
Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband<br>
Not met us on the way.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Oswald</span></p>
<p class="speech">Now, where&#8217;s your master&#8217;?</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, within; but never man so changed.<br>
I told him of the army that was landed;<br>
He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:<br>
His answer was &#8216;The worse:&#8217; of Gloucester&#8217;s
treachery,<br>
And of the loyal service of his son,<br>
When I inform&#8217;d him, then he call&#8217;d me sot,<br>
And told me I had turn&#8217;d the wrong side out:<br>
What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;<br>
What like, offensive.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[To Edmund]</span> Then shall
you go no further.<br>
It is the cowish terror of his spirit,<br>
That dares not undertake: he&#8217;ll not feel wrongs<br>
Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way<br>
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;<br>
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:<br>
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff<br>
Into my husband&#8217;s hands. This trusty servant<br>
Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,<br>
If you dare venture in your own behalf,<br>
A mistress&#8217;s command. Wear this; spare speech;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Giving a favour</span></p>
<p class="speech">Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst
speak,<br>
Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:<br>
Conceive, and fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edmund</p>
<p class="speech">Yours in the ranks of death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">My most dear Gloucester!</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit Edmund</span></p>
<p class="speech">O, the difference of man and man!<br>
To thee a woman&#8217;s services are due:<br>
My fool usurps my body.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, here comes my lord.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Albany</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">I have been worth the whistle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">O Goneril!<br>
You are not worth the dust which the rude wind<br>
Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:<br>
That nature, which contemns its origin,<br>
Cannot be border&#8217;d certain in itself;<br>
She that herself will sliver and disbranch<br>
From her material sap, perforce must wither<br>
And come to deadly use.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">No more; the text is foolish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:<br>
Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?<br>
Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform&#8217;d?<br>
A father, and a gracious aged man,<br>
Whose reverence even the head-lugg&#8217;d bear would lick,<br>
Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.<br>
Could my good brother suffer you to do it?<br>
A man, a prince, by him so benefited!<br>
If that the heavens do not their visible spirits<br>
Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,<br>
It will come,<br>
Humanity must perforce prey on itself,<br>
Like monsters of the deep.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Milk-liver&#8217;d man!<br>
That bear&#8217;st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;<br>
Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning<br>
Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know&#8217;st<br>
Fools do those villains pity who are punish&#8217;d<br>
Ere they have done their mischief. Where&#8217;s thy drum?<br>
France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;<br>
With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;<br>
Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit&#8217;st still, and criest<br>
&#8216;Alack, why does he so?&#8217;</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">See thyself, devil!<br>
Proper deformity seems not in the fiend<br>
So horrid as in woman.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">O vain fool!</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Thou changed and self-cover&#8217;d thing, for
shame,<br>
Be-monster not thy feature. Were&#8217;t my fitness<br>
To let these hands obey my blood,<br>
They are apt enough to dislocate and tear<br>
Thy flesh and bones: howe&#8217;er thou art a fiend,<br>
A woman&#8217;s shape doth shield thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech">Marry, your manhood now&#8212;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter a Messenger</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">What news?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall&#8217;s
dead:<br>
Slain by his servant, going to put out<br>
The other eye of Gloucester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester&#8217;s eye!</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">A servant that he bred, thrill&#8217;d with
remorse,<br>
Opposed against the act, bending his sword<br>
To his great master; who, thereat enraged,<br>
Flew on him, and amongst them fell&#8217;d him dead;<br>
But not without that harmful stroke, which since<br>
Hath pluck&#8217;d him after.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">This shows you are above,<br>
You justicers, that these our nether crimes<br>
So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!<br>
Lost he his other eye?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Both, both, my lord.<br>
This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;<br>
&#8217;Tis from your sister.</p>
<p class="speaker">Goneril</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Aside]</span> One way I like
this well;<br>
But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,<br>
May all the building in my fancy pluck<br>
Upon my hateful life: another way,<br>
The news is not so tart.&#8212;I&#8217;ll read, and answer.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>

<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Knows he the wickedness?</p>
<p class="speaker">Messenger</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, my good lord; &#8217;twas he inform&#8217;d
against him;<br>
And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment<br>
Might have the freer course.</p>
<p class="speaker">Albany</p>
<p class="speech">Gloucester, I live<br>
To thank thee for the love thou show&#8217;dst the king,<br>
And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:<br>
Tell me what more thou know&#8217;st.</p>

<h4>Scene III. The French camp near Dover.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Kent and a
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Why the King of France is so suddenly gone
back
know you the reason?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Something he left imperfect in the
state, which since his coming forth is thought
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
fear and danger, that his personal return was
most required and necessary.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Who hath he left behind him general?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Did your letters pierce the queen to any
demonstration of grief?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my
presence;<br>
And now and then an ample tear trill&#8217;d down<br>
Her delicate cheek: it seem&#8217;d she was a queen<br>
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,<br>
Sought to be king o&#8217;er her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">O, then it moved her.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove<br>
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen<br>
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears<br>
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,<br>
That play&#8217;d on her ripe lip, seem&#8217;d not to know<br>
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,<br>
As pearls from diamonds dropp&#8217;d. In brief,<br>
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,<br>
If all could so become it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Made she no verbal question?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Faith, once or twice she heaved the name
of &#8216;father&#8217;<br>
Pantingly forth, as if it press&#8217;d her heart:<br>
Cried &#8216;sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!<br>
Kent! father! sisters! What, i&#8217; the storm? i&#8217; the
night?<br>
Let pity not be believed!&#8217; There she shook<br>
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,<br>
And clamour moisten&#8217;d: then away she started<br>
To deal with grief alone.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">It is the stars,<br>
The stars above us, govern our conditions;<br>
Else one self mate and mate could not beget<br>
Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Was this before the king return&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">No, since.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear&#8217;s
i&#8217; the town;<br>
Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers<br>
What we are come about, and by no means<br>
Will yield to see his daughter.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Why, good sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own
unkindness,<br>
That stripp&#8217;d her from his benediction, turn&#8217;d her<br>
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights<br>
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting<br>
His mind so venomously, that burning shame<br>
Detains him from Cordelia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, poor gentleman!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Of Albany&#8217;s and Cornwall&#8217;s powers you
heard not?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis so, they are afoot.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Well, sir, I&#8217;ll bring you to our master
Lear,<br>
And leave you to attend him: some dear cause<br>
Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;<br>
When I am known aright, you shall not grieve<br>
Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go<br>
Along with me.</p>

She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks<br>
To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">I, madam?</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">I speak in understanding; you are; I
know&#8217;t:<br>
Therefore I do advise you, take this note:<br>
My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk&#8217;d;<br>
And more convenient is he for my hand<br>
Than for your lady&#8217;s: you may gather more.<br>
If you do find him, pray you, give him this;<br>
And when your mistress hears thus much from you,<br>
I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.<br>
So, fare you well.<br>
If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,<br>
Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.</p>
<p class="speaker">Oswald</p>
<p class="speech">Would I could meet him, madam! I should show<br>
What party I do follow.</p>
<p class="speaker">Regan</p>
<p class="speech">Fare thee well.</p>

<h4>Scene Vi. Fields near Dover.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Gloucester, and Edgar
dressed like a peasant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">When shall we come to the top of that same
hill?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks the ground is even.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Horrible steep.<br>
Hark, do you hear the sea?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">No, truly.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect<br>
By your eyes&#8217; anguish.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">So may it be, indeed:<br>
Methinks thy voice is alter&#8217;d; and thou speak&#8217;st<br>
In better phrase and matter than thou didst.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">You&#8217;re much deceived: in nothing am I
changed<br>
But in my garments.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Methinks you&#8217;re better spoken.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Come on, sir; here&#8217;s the place: stand
still. How fearful<br>
And dizzy &#8217;tis, to cast one&#8217;s eyes so low!<br>
The crows and choughs that wing the midway air<br>
Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down<br>
Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!<br>
Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:<br>
The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,<br>
Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,<br>
Diminish&#8217;d to her cock; her cock, a buoy<br>
Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,<br>
That on the unnumber&#8217;d idle pebbles chafes,<br>
Cannot be heard so high. I&#8217;ll look no more;<br>
Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight<br>
Topple down headlong.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Set me where you stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your hand: you are now within a foot<br>
Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon<br>
Would I not leap upright.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Let go my hand.<br>
Here, friend, &#8217;s another purse; in it a jewel<br>
Well worth a poor man&#8217;s taking: fairies and gods<br>
Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;<br>
Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Now fare you well, good sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">With all my heart.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Why I do trifle thus with his despair<br>
Is done to cure it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">[Kneeling]</span> O you
mighty gods!<br>
This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,<br>
Shake patiently my great affliction off:<br>
If I could bear it longer, and not fall<br>
To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,<br>
My snuff and loathed part of nature should<br>
Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!<br>
Now, fellow, fare thee well.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">He falls forward</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Gone, sir: farewell.<br>
And yet I know not how conceit may rob<br>
The treasury of life, when life itself<br>
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,<br>
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?<br>
Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!<br>
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.<br>
What are you, sir?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Away, and let me die.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers,
air,<br>
So many fathom down precipitating,<br>
Thou&#8217;dst shiver&#8217;d like an egg: but thou dost
breathe;<br>
Hast heavy substance; bleed&#8217;st not; speak&#8217;st; art
sound.<br>
Ten masts at each make not the altitude<br>
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:<br>
Thy life&#8217;s a miracle. Speak yet again.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">But have I fall&#8217;n, or no?</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.<br>
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far<br>
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, I have no eyes.<br>
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,<br>
To end itself by death? &#8217;Twas yet some comfort,<br>
When misery could beguile the tyrant&#8217;s rage,<br>
And frustrate his proud will.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Give me your arm:<br>
Up: so. How is &#8217;t? Feel you your legs? You stand.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Too well, too well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">This is above all strangeness.<br>
Upon the crown o&#8217; the cliff, what thing was that<br>
Which parted from you?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">A poor unfortunate beggar.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">As I stood here below, methought his eyes<br>
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,<br>
Horns whelk&#8217;d and waved like the enridged sea:<br>
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,<br>
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours<br>
Of men&#8217;s impossibilities, have preserved thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I do remember now: henceforth I&#8217;ll bear<br>
Affliction till it do cry out itself<br>
&#8216;Enough, enough,&#8217; and die. That thing you speak of,<br>
I took it for a man; often &#8217;twould say<br>
&#8216;The fiend, the fiend:&#8217; he led me to that place.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes
here?</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter King Lear,
fantastically dressed with wild flowers</span></p>
<p class="speech">The safer sense will ne&#8217;er accommodate<br>
His master thus.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am
the
king himself.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">O thou side-piercing sight!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Nature&#8217;s above art in that respect.
There&#8217;s your
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier&#8217;s yard. Look,
look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
cheese will do &#8217;t. There&#8217;s my gauntlet; I&#8217;ll
prove
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
flown, bird! i&#8217; the clout, i&#8217; the clout: hewgh!
Give the word.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet marjoram.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Pass.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I know that voice.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They
flattered
me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
beard ere the black ones were there. To say &#8216;ay&#8217;
and &#8216;no&#8217; to every thing that I
said!&#8212;&#8216;Ay&#8217; and &#8216;no&#8217;
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
found &#8217;em, there I smelt &#8217;em out. Go to, they are
not men o&#8217; their words: they told me I was every
thing; &#8217;tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">The trick of that voice I do well remember:<br>
Is &#8217;t not the king?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, every inch a king:<br>
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.<br>
I pardon that man&#8217;s life. What was thy cause? Adultery?<br>
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:<br>
The wren goes to &#8217;t, and the small gilded fly<br>
Does lecher in my sight.<br>
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester&#8217;s bastard son<br>
Was kinder to his father than my daughters<br>
Got &#8217;tween the lawful sheets.<br>
To &#8217;t, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.<br>
Behold yond simpering dame,<br>
Whose face between her forks presages snow;<br>
That minces virtue, and does shake the head<br>
To hear of pleasure&#8217;s name;<br>
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to &#8217;t<br>
With a more riotous appetite.<br>
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,<br>
Though women all above:<br>
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,<br>
Beneath is all the fiends&#8217;;<br>
There&#8217;s hell, there&#8217;s darkness, there&#8217;s the
sulphurous pit,<br>
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
there&#8217;s money for thee.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O, let me kiss that hand!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">O ruin&#8217;d piece of nature! This great
world<br>
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou
squiny
at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I&#8217;ll not
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
penning of it.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Were all the letters suns, I could not see
one.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">I would not take this from report; it is,<br>
And my heart breaks at it.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Read.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">What, with the case of eyes?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
this world goes.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">I see it feelingly.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">What, art mad? A man may see how this world
goes
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
a farmer&#8217;s dog bark at a beggar?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gloucester</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">And the creature run from the cur? There thou
mightst behold the great image of authority: a
dog&#8217;s obeyed in office.<br>
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br>
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;<br>
Thou hotly lust&#8217;st to use her in that kind<br>
For which thou whipp&#8217;st her. The usurer hangs the
cozener.<br>
Through tatter&#8217;d clothes small vices do appear;<br>
Robes and furr&#8217;d gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,<br>
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:<br>
Arm it in rags, a pigmy&#8217;s straw does pierce it.<br>
None does offend, none, I say, none; I&#8217;ll able &#8217;em:<br>
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power<br>
To seal the accuser&#8217;s lips. Get thee glass eyes;<br>
And like a scurvy politician, seem<br>
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:<br>
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Edgar</p>
<p class="speech">O, matter and impertinency mix&#8217;d! Reason in
madness!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.<br>
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:<br>
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:<br>
Thou know&#8217;st, the first time that we smell the air,<br>
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.</p>

<p class="speech">Alack, alack the day!</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">When we are born, we cry that we are come<br>
To this great stage of fools: this a good block;<br>
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe<br>
A troop of horse with felt: I&#8217;ll put &#8217;t in proof;<br>
And when I have stol&#8217;n upon these sons-in-law,<br>
Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!</p>

You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;<br>

<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Be govern&#8217;d by your knowledge, and
proceed<br>
I&#8217; the sway of your own will. Is he array&#8217;d?</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep<br>
We put fresh garments on him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;<br>
I doubt not of his temperance.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Very well.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">Please you, draw near. Louder the music
there!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">O my dear father! Restoration hang<br>
Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss<br>
Repair those violent harms that my two sisters<br>
Have in thy reverence made!</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Kind and dear princess!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Had you not been their father, these white
flakes<br>
Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face<br>
To be opposed against the warring winds?<br>
To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?<br>
In the most terrible and nimble stroke<br>
Of quick, cross lightning? to watch&#8212;poor perdu!&#8212;<br>
With this thin helm? Mine enemy&#8217;s dog,<br>
Though he had bit me, should have stood that night<br>
Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,<br>
To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,<br>
In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!<br>
&#8217;Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once<br>
Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">Madam, do you; &#8217;tis fittest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">How does my royal lord? How fares your
majesty?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You do me wrong to take me out o&#8217; the
grave:<br>
Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound<br>
Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears<br>
Do scald like moulten lead.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Sir, do you know me?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Still, still, far wide!</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">He&#8217;s scarce awake: let him alone
awhile.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?<br>
I am mightily abused. I should e&#8217;en die with pity,<br>
To see another thus. I know not what to say.<br>
I will not swear these are my hands: let&#8217;s see;<br>
I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured<br>
Of my condition!</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;O, look upon me, sir,<br>
And hold your hands in benediction o&#8217;er me:<br>
No, sir, you must not kneel.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Pray, do not mock me:<br>
I am a very foolish fond old man,<br>
Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;<br>
And, to deal plainly,<br>
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.<br>
Methinks I should know you, and know this man;<br>
Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant<br>
What place this is; and all the skill I have<br>
Remembers not these garments; nor I know not<br>
Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;<br>
For, as I am a man, I think this lady<br>
To be my child Cordelia.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">And so I am, I am.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Be your tears wet? yes, &#8217;faith. I pray,
weep not:<br>
If you have poison for me, I will drink it.<br>
I know you do not love me; for your sisters<br>
Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:<br>
You have some cause, they have not.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">No cause, no cause.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Am I in France?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;In your own kingdom, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">Do not abuse me.</p>
<p class="speaker">Doctor</p>
<p class="speech">Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,<br>
You see, is kill&#8217;d in him: and yet it is danger<br>
To make him even o&#8217;er the time he has lost.<br>
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more<br>
Till further settling.</p>
<p class="speaker">Cordelia</p>
<p class="speech">Will&#8217;t please your highness walk?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Lear</p>
<p class="speech">You must bear with me:<br>
Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all but Kent and
Gentleman</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was
so slain?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Most certain, sir.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">Who is conductor of his people?</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">As &#8217;tis said, the bastard son of
Gloucester.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the
Earl
of Kent in Germany.</p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">Report is changeable. &#8217;Tis time to look
about; the
powers of the kingdom approach apace.</p>
<p class="speaker">Gentleman</p>
<p class="speech">The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare
you
well, sir.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Kent</p>
<p class="speech">My point and period will be throughly
wrought,<br>
Or well or ill, as this day&#8217;s battle&#8217;s fought.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
