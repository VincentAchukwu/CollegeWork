<h3>ACT IV</h3>
<div id="act4.1" class="scene" title="Scene I. Westminster Hall.">
<h4>Scene I. Westminster Hall.</h4>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter, as to the Parliament,
Henry Bolingbroke, Duke Of Aumerle, Northumberland, Henry Percy,
Lord Fitzwater, Duke Of Surrey, the Bishop Of Carlisle, the Abbot
Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald, Officers, and
Bagot</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Call forth Bagot.<br>
Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;<br>
What thou dost know of noble Gloucester&#8217;s death,<br>
Who wrought it with the king, and who perform&#8217;d<br>
The bloody office of his timeless end.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>
<p class="speech">Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bagot</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue<br>
Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver&#8217;d.<br>
In that dead time when Gloucester&#8217;s death was plotted,<br>
I heard you say, &#8216;Is not my arm of length,<br>
That reacheth from the restful English court<br>
As far as Calais, to mine uncle&#8217;s head?&#8217;<br>
Amongst much other talk, that very time,<br>
I heard you say that you had rather refuse<br>
The offer of an hundred thousand crowns<br>
Than Bolingbroke&#8217;s return to England;<br>
Adding withal how blest this land would be<br>
In this your cousin&#8217;s death.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Princes and noble lords,<br>
What answer shall I make to this base man?<br>
Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,<br>
On equal terms to give him chastisement?<br>
Either I must, or have mine honour soil&#8217;d<br>
With the attainder of his slanderous lips.<br>
There is my gage, the manual seal of death,<br>
That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,<br>
And will maintain what thou hast said is false<br>
In thy heart-blood, though being all too base<br>
To stain the temper of my knightly sword.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Excepting one, I would he were the best<br>
In all this presence that hath moved me so.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">If that thy valour stand on sympathy,<br>
There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:<br>
By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand&#8217;st,<br>
I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it<br>
That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester&#8217;s death.<br>
If thou deny&#8217;st it twenty times, thou liest;<br>
And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,<br>
Where it was forged, with my rapier&#8217;s point.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Thou darest not, coward, live to see that
day.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Fitzwater, thou art damn&#8217;d to hell for
this.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Percy</p>
<p class="speech">Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true<br>
In this appeal as thou art all unjust;<br>
And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,<br>
To prove it on thee to the extremest point<br>
Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">An if I do not, may my hands rot off<br>
And never brandish more revengeful steel<br>
Over the glittering helmet of my foe!</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord</p>
<p class="speech">I task the earth to the like, forsworn
Aumerle;<br>
And spur thee on with full as many lies<br>
As may be holloa&#8217;d in thy treacherous ear<br>
From sun to sun: there is my honour&#8217;s pawn;<br>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Who sets me else? by heaven, I&#8217;ll throw at
all:<br>
I have a thousand spirits in one breast,<br>
To answer twenty thousand such as you.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well<br>
The very time Aumerle and you did talk.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">&#8217;Tis very true: you were in presence
then;<br>
And you can witness with me this is true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is
true.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">Surrey, thou liest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Surrey</p>
<p class="speech">Dishonourable boy!<br>
That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,<br>
That it shall render vengeance and revenge<br>
Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie<br>
In earth as quiet as thy father&#8217;s skull:<br>
In proof whereof, there is my honour&#8217;s pawn;<br>
Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.</p>
<p class="speaker">Lord Fitzwater</p>
<p class="speech">How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!<br>
If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,<br>
I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,<br>
And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,<br>
And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,<br>
To tie thee to my strong correction.<br>
As I intend to thrive in this new world,<br>
Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:<br>
Besides, I heard the banish&#8217;d Norfolk say<br>
That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men<br>
To execute the noble duke at Calais.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">Some honest Christian trust me with a gage<br>
That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,<br>
If he may be repeal&#8217;d, to try his honour.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">These differences shall all rest under gage<br>
Till Norfolk be repeal&#8217;d: repeal&#8217;d he shall be,<br>
And, though mine enemy, restored again<br>
To all his lands and signories: when he&#8217;s return&#8217;d,<br>
Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">That honourable day shall ne&#8217;er be
seen.<br>
Many a time hath banish&#8217;d Norfolk fought<br>
For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,<br>
Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross<br>
Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:<br>
And toil&#8217;d with works of war, retired himself<br>
To Italy; and there at Venice gave<br>
His body to that pleasant country&#8217;s earth,<br>
And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,<br>
Under whose colours he had fought so long.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">As surely as I live, my lord.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the
bosom<br>
Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,<br>
Your differences shall all rest under gage<br>
Till we assign you to your days of trial.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Enter Duke Of York,
attended</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee<br>
From plume-pluck&#8217;d Richard; who with willing soul<br>
Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields<br>
To the possession of thy royal hand:<br>
Ascend his throne, descending now from him;<br>
And long live Henry, fourth of that name!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">In God&#8217;s name, I&#8217;ll ascend the regal
throne.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">Marry. God forbid!<br>
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,<br>
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.<br>
Would God that any in this noble presence<br>
Were enough noble to be upright judge<br>
Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would<br>
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.<br>
What subject can give sentence on his king?<br>
And who sits here that is not Richard&#8217;s subject?<br>
Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,<br>
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;<br>
And shall the figure of God&#8217;s majesty,<br>
His captain, steward, deputy-elect,<br>
Anointed, crowned, planted many years,<br>
Be judged by subject and inferior breath,<br>
And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,<br>
That in a Christian climate souls refined<br>
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!<br>
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,<br>
Stirr&#8217;d up by God, thus boldly for his king:<br>
My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,<br>
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford&#8217;s king:<br>
And if you crown him, let me prophesy:<br>
The blood of English shall manure the ground,<br>
And future ages groan for this foul act;<br>
Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,<br>
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars<br>
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;<br>
Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny<br>
Shall here inhabit, and this land be call&#8217;d<br>
The field of Golgotha and dead men&#8217;s skulls.<br>
O, if you raise this house against this house,<br>
It will the woefullest division prove<br>
That ever fell upon this cursed earth.<br>
Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,<br>
Lest child, child&#8217;s children, cry against you woe!</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Well have you argued, sir; and, for your
pains,<br>
Of capital treason we arrest you here.<br>
My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge<br>
To keep him safely till his day of trial.<br>
May it please you, lords, to grant the commons&#8217; suit.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Fetch hither Richard, that in common view<br>
He may surrender; so we shall proceed<br>
Without suspicion.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;I will be his conduct.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Lords, you that here are under our arrest,<br>
Procure your sureties for your days of answer.<br>
Little are we beholding to your love,<br>
And little look&#8217;d for at your helping hands.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Duke Of York, with
King Richard II, and Officers bearing the regalia</span></p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Alack, why am I sent for to a king,<br>
Before I have shook off the regal thoughts<br>
Wherewith I reign&#8217;d? I hardly yet have learn&#8217;d<br>
To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:<br>
Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me<br>
To this submission. Yet I well remember<br>
The favours of these men: were they not mine?<br>
Did they not sometime cry, &#8216;all hail!&#8217; to me?<br>
So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,<br>
Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.<br>
God save the king! Will no man say amen?<br>
Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.<br>
God save the king! although I be not he;<br>
And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.<br>
To do what service am I sent for hither?</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of York</p>
<p class="speech">To do that office of thine own good will<br>
Which tired majesty did make thee offer,<br>
The resignation of thy state and crown<br>
To Henry Bolingbroke.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the
crown;<br>
Here cousin:<br>
On this side my hand, and on that side yours.<br>
Now is this golden crown like a deep well<br>
That owes two buckets, filling one another,<br>
The emptier ever dancing in the air,<br>
The other down, unseen and full of water:<br>
That bucket down and full of tears am I,<br>
Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">I thought you had been willing to resign.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:<br>
You may my glories and my state depose,<br>
But not my griefs; still am I king of those.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Part of your cares you give me with your
crown.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.<br>
My care is loss of care, by old care done;<br>
Your care is gain of care, by new care won:<br>
The cares I give I have, though given away;<br>
They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Are you contented to resign the crown?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;<br>
Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.<br>
Now mark me, how I will undo myself;<br>
I give this heavy weight from off my head<br>
And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,<br>
The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;<br>
With mine own tears I wash away my balm,<br>
With mine own hands I give away my crown,<br>
With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,<br>
With mine own breath release all duty&#8217;s rites:<br>
All pomp and majesty I do forswear;<br>
My manors, rents, revenues I forego;<br>
My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:<br>
God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!<br>
God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!<br>
Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,<br>
And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!<br>
Long mayst thou live in Richard&#8217;s seat to sit,<br>
And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!<br>
God save King Harry, unking&#8217;d Richard says,<br>
And send him many years of sunshine days!<br>
What more remains?</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;No more, but that you read<br>
These accusations and these grievous crimes<br>
Committed by your person and your followers<br>
Against the state and profit of this land;<br>
That, by confessing them, the souls of men<br>
May deem that you are worthily deposed.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Must I do so? and must I ravel out<br>
My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,<br>
If thy offences were upon record,<br>
Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop<br>
To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,<br>
There shouldst thou find one heinous article,<br>
Containing the deposing of a king<br>
And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,<br>
Mark&#8217;d with a blot, damn&#8217;d in the book of heaven:<br>
Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,<br>
Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,<br>
Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands<br>
Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates<br>
Have here deliver&#8217;d me to my sour cross,<br>
And water cannot wash away your sin.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My lord, dispatch; read o&#8217;er these
articles.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:<br>
And yet salt water blinds them not so much<br>
But they can see a sort of traitors here.<br>
Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,<br>
I find myself a traitor with the rest;<br>
For I have given here my soul&#8217;s consent<br>
To undeck the pompous body of a king;<br>
Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,<br>
Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,&#8212;</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,<br>
Nor no man&#8217;s lord; I have no name, no title,<br>
No, not that name was given me at the font,<br>
But &#8217;tis usurp&#8217;d: alack the heavy day,<br>
That I have worn so many winters out,<br>
And know not now what name to call myself!<br>
O that I were a mockery king of snow,<br>
Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,<br>
To melt myself away in water-drops!<br>
Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,<br>
An if my word be sterling yet in England,<br>
Let it command a mirror hither straight,<br>
That it may show me what a face I have,<br>
Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exit an attendant</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">Read o&#8217;er this paper while the glass doth
come.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Fiend, thou torment&#8217;st me ere I come to
hell!</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.</p>
<p class="speaker">Northumberland</p>
<p class="speech">The commons will not then be satisfied.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">They shall be satisfied: I&#8217;ll read
enough,<br>
When I do see the very book indeed<br>
Where all my sins are writ, and that&#8217;s myself.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Re-enter Attendant, with a
glass</span></p>
<p class="speech">Give me the glass, and therein will I read.<br>
No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck<br>
So many blows upon this face of mine,<br>
And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,<br>
Like to my followers in prosperity,<br>
Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face<br>
That every day under his household roof<br>
Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face<br>
That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?<br>
Was this the face that faced so many follies,<br>
And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?<br>
A brittle glory shineth in this face:<br>
As brittle as the glory is the face;</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Dashes the glass against the
ground</span></p>
<p class="speech">For there it is, crack&#8217;d in a hundred
shivers.<br>
Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,<br>
How soon my sorrow hath destroy&#8217;d my face.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">The shadow of your sorrow hath
destroy&#8217;d<br>
The shadow or your face.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Say that again.<br>
The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let&#8217;s see:<br>
&#8217;Tis very true, my grief lies all within;<br>
And these external manners of laments<br>
Are merely shadows to the unseen grief<br>
That swells with silence in the tortured soul;<br>
There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,<br>
For thy great bounty, that not only givest<br>
Me cause to wail but teachest me the way<br>
How to lament the cause. I&#8217;ll beg one boon,<br>
And then be gone and trouble you no more.<br>
Shall I obtain it?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">&#8195;&#8195;Name it, fair cousin.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">&#8216;Fair cousin&#8217;? I am greater than a
king:<br>
For when I was a king, my flatterers<br>
Were then but subjects; being now a subject,<br>
I have a king here to my flatterer.<br>
Being so great, I have no need to beg.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Yet ask.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">And shall I have?</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">You shall.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Then give me leave to go.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Whither?</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">Whither you will, so I were from your sights.</p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.</p>
<p class="speaker">King Richard II</p>
<p class="speech">O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,<br>
That rise thus nimbly by a true king&#8217;s fall.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt King Richard II, some
Lords, and a Guard</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Henry Bolingbroke</p>
<p class="speech">On Wednesday next we solemnly set down<br>
Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt all except the Bishop
Of Carlisle, the Abbot of Westminster, and Duke Of
Aumerle</span></p>
<p class="speaker">Abbot</p>
<p class="speech">A woeful pageant have we here beheld.</p>
<p class="speaker">Bishop Of Carlisle</p>
<p class="speech">The woe&#8217;s to come; the children yet
unborn.<br>
Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.</p>
<p class="speaker">Duke Of Aumerle</p>
<p class="speech">You holy clergymen, is there no plot<br>
To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?</p>
<p class="speaker">Abbot</p>
<p class="speech">My lord,<br>
Before I freely speak my mind herein,<br>
You shall not only take the sacrament<br>
To bury mine intents, but also to effect<br>
Whatever I shall happen to devise.<br>
I see your brows are full of discontent,<br>
Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:<br>
Come home with me to supper; and I&#8217;ll lay<br>
A plot shall show us all a merry day.</p>
<p class="speech"><span class="stage">Exeunt</span></p>
